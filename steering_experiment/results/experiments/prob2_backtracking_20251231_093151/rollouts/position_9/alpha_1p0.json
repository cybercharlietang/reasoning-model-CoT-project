    "text": " Maybe breaking it down by each digit place will make it easier. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, the 4 can appear in every set of ten numbers. For example, in 1-10, the 4 appears once (page 4). Then in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, from 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of ten, so 48 fours. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit doesn't hit another 4, so that's 48 fours from the units place. Now, the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 fours. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49, that's one set, then 140-149 is another, 240-249 another, 340-349 another, and 440-449 another. That's 5 sets. So, 5 times 10 is 50 fours in the tens place. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total fours are 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds place. Starting with units place. Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears once every ten numbers, like 8, 18, 28, etc. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488? Again, 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 eights from the units place. Now, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be another set, but since we only go up to 488, 480-488 is part of that. So, how many complete sets of 80-89, etc., are there? Let's see: 80-89 is one set, 180-189 another, 280-289 another, 380-389 another. That's 4 sets. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 is 40 eights. But wait, in the range 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's an extra 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, no, that might be double-counting. Let me think again. The range 480-488 is part of the hundreds digit being 4, but the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, the 8's in 480-488 are 9 numbers, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: from 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights from the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights from each place: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total eights are 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (fours) - 97 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 pages. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 fours. The remaining pages (481-488) don't add more 4's here.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages in each range (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). That's 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 fours.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for all pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, contributing 89 fours.\n   \nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 pages, contributing 48 eights.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and partially in 480-488. That's 4 full ranges \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can think about each place value one by one. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, plus one more time in the 481-488 range because 484 has a 4 in the units place. Wait, no, 484 is part of the 480-489 block, so actually, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Let me think again. For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once in the units place here (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 440-449. Let me count how many such blocks there are. Each hundred has one block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100, 40-49 is one block (10 numbers), so 10 times. Then 140-149 is another block (another 10), so 10 times. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks in total, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. So, the tens place contributes 50 4's.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many blocks of 10 are there? 48 full blocks (1-480) and then 481-488. So, in the units place, 48 times from the blocks, plus in 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. 180-189 is another 10, and so on. How many such blocks are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks each have 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because when I counted the tens place for 8's, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check again. The blocks where the tens digit is 8 are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences except the last one. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes it's easy to miscount, especially in the tens place. Let me recount the 4's and 8's again to make sure.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, 48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: Same as 4's, 48 full blocks (1-480) contributing 48, and 481-488 contributing 1 (488), so 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full blocks of 10 (1-480) contribute 48 occurrences. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add 1 more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 5 blocks of 100 (40-49, 140-149, etc.) contribute 10 each, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Numbers 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full blocks contribute 48, and 488 adds 1, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 5 blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contribute 10 each, except the last block (480-488) contributing 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can count the number of 4's in each digit place and then add them up. Similarly, I'll do the same for 8's. Let's start with the 4's.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit 4 appears in 484. So, that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks of 100. Specifically, for each hundred, the numbers 40-49 have 4 in the tens place. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place per hundred. Now, how many hundreds do we have? From 1-488, we have 4 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds go up to 400-488. So, let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundred, from 0-99: 40-49 is one block, so 10 times. Similarly, 100-199: 140-149, another 10 times. 200-299: 240-249, 10 times. 300-399: 340-349, 10 times. Now, 400-488: the tens place is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 times. Wait, but 488 is the end, so 440-449 is fully included. So, that's 10 times. So, how many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times except maybe the last one. Wait, but 400-488: the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, so that's fine. So, total for tens place: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but wait, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488: that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400 is included, 488 is included, so the count is 488-400+1=89. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then one more in the last partial block, so 49. Tens: 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds: 89 numbers from 400-488, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and then the last partial block (481-488) includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 8 appears in blocks of 100. Specifically, for each hundred, the numbers 80-89 have 8 in the tens place. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place per hundred. Now, how many hundreds do we have? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 times, so 5\u00d710=50 times in the tens place. Wait, but let me check the last block, 400-488. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, that's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, does that affect the count? Wait, in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, for the last block, it's 9 times instead of 10. So, does that mean I overcounted earlier?\n\nWait, so for the first four blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each has 10 occurrences in the tens place. The last block, 400-488, has 9 occurrences because 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, total tens place 8's would be 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. Hmm, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by assuming 5 blocks each with 10, but actually, the last block only contributes 9.\n\nWait, let me confirm: from 0-99, 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488), so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nOkay, so I was wrong earlier; it's 49, not 50.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see, the first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, as we saw, it's 49 times. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the tens place, I considered that the last block (400-488) only contributes 9 times, so that's 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, so total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's. From 0-99: 40-49: 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-199:140-149:10.\n\nFrom 200-299:240-249:10.\n\nFrom 300-399:340-349:10.\n\nFrom 400-488:440-449:10.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's fine.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's would be 89, but let me confirm: from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 4's. From 1-488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, and then the last partial block (481-488) includes 484, which is one more. So, 48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place of 8's, same calculation: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and the last partial block includes 488, so one more, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 0-99:40-49:10.\n\n100-199:140-149:10.\n\n200-299:240-249:10.\n\n300-399:340-349:10.\n\n400-488:440-449:10.\n\nSo, 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: from 0-99:80-89:10.\n\n100-199:180-189:10.\n\n200-299:280-289:10.\n\n300-399:380-389:10.\n\n400-488:480-488:9.\n\nSo, 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, the counts seem accurate.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me just think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using digit positions and calculating for each position how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a formula for digit counting.\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), we can calculate the number of times a digit appears.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the k-th position (units=1, tens=10, hundreds=100, etc.) is as follows:\n\nLet n be the number, which is 488.\n\nFor each position, say, the units place:\n\n- Divide n by 10, which gives 48.8. The integer part is 48, so 48 full cycles of 0-9, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but actually, for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nnumber_of_cycles = n // 10\n\ncount = number_of_cycles\n\nif the units digit of n is >= d, then count +=1\n\nBut wait, this is for the digit d in the units place. So, for d=4:\n\nn=488\n\nnumber_of_cycles = 488 //10 =48\n\nunits_digit = 488 %10 =8\n\nsince 8 >=4, count=48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly for d=8:\n\nnumber_of_cycles=48\n\nunits_digit=8 >=8, so count=48+1=49.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nThe formula is a bit different. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is calculated as:\n\nhigher = n // 100\n\ncurrent = (n //10) %10\n\nlower = n %10\n\nif current > d: count = (higher +1)*10\n\nif current == d: count = (higher)*10 + lower +1\n\nif current < d: count = higher*10\n\nWait, let me test this formula for d=4 in the tens place.\n\nn=488.\n\nhigher =488//100=4\n\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8%10=8\n\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current=8 > d=4:\n\ncount=(4+1)*10=5*10=50.\n\nWhich matches our earlier count of 50 for 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in the tens place:\n\nhigher=4\n\ncurrent=8\n\nlower=8\n\nSince current=8 >=d=8:\n\ncount=higher*10 + lower +1=4*10 +8 +1=40+8+1=49.\n\nWhich matches our earlier count of 49 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place:\n\nThe formula is:\n\nhigher = n //1000\n\ncurrent = (n //100) %10\n\nlower = n %100\n\nif current > d: count = higher*100\n\nif current ==d: count=higher*100 + lower +1\n\nif current <d: count=0\n\nWait, let's apply this for d=4.\n\nn=488.\n\nhigher=488//1000=0\n\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4%10=4\n\nlower=488%100=88\n\nSince current=4 ==d=4:\n\ncount=higher*100 + lower +1=0*100 +88 +1=89.\n\nWhich matches our earlier count of 89 for 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nFor d=8 in the hundreds place:\n\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4 <8, so count=0.\n\nWhich is correct because 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in 488.\n\nSo, using this formula, we can confirm that the counts are accurate.\n\nThus, total 4's:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 times.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe it's easier to count the occurrences of 4 in each position and then add them up. Similarly, I'll do the same for 8. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, the 4's will appear every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Wait, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds another 4 in the units place. So, actually, it's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8. So, in each group of 10, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each group, 4 appears once in the units place. So, for 488 pages, how many full groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 484 is included, which is the 4th number in that partial group. So, that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last page is 488, which is in the 489th group? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit is 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 10n - 6, where n starts at 1. Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as starting at 4 and adding 10 each time. So, the number of terms is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. Let me compute that: (488 - 4) is 484, divided by 10 is 48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. Okay, so units place: 49 times 4. Now, let's move on to the tens place. In the tens place, 4 can appear as 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last group would be 440-449, and then 480-488. Wait, no, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but the tens digit here would be 8 in 480-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, for each hundred, there's a 40-49 range, except for the last hundred, which is 400-488. Wait, but in the 400-488 range, the tens digit can be 0-8, but specifically, 40-49 in the 400s would be 440-449, which is a full 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's one 40-49 block. So, how many hundreds are there? From 0-488, the hundreds are 0 (1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), 4 (400-488). So, 5 hundreds in total. Each contributes one 40-49 block, except the last one, which only goes up to 488. Wait, no, the 400-488 block includes 440-449, which is a full 40-49 block in the tens place. So, each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check. From 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, tens place: 50 times 4. Now, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times 4. Wait, but wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place. How many times does 8 appear in the units digit from 1 to 488? Similar to the 4's, it's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's calculate. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term is 10n - 2, starting at n=1. So, 10n - 2 = 488. Solving for n: 10n = 490, so n=49. So, there are 49 numbers where the units digit is 8. So, units place: 49 times 8.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, let's count each block. From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, 10. 300-399: 380-389, 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place: 49 times 8.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times 8.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's correct. So, 49 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought the hundreds place for 8 is zero because the book only goes up to 488, so no page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 50 times.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times.\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 49 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I counted the hundreds place for 4's, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is included in the tens place count for 4's. Yes, because in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8's again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nYes, I think that's right. So, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can use a systematic approach for each place. Let's start with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times for each block, plus one more time in the incomplete block if the last number is 484, 485, etc. Wait, let me think again. Actually, in each block of 10, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so the digit 4 appears once per block. So, for 488 pages, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times (for each complete block) plus the number of times 4 appears in the units place in the last partial block. The last partial block is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place in this partial block. So, units place: 48 times. Now, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges are there up to 488. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10) From 200-299: 240-249 (10) From 300-399: 340-349 (10) From 400-488: 440-449 (10, since 440-449 is within 400-488). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, tens place: 50 times. Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Similar to 4, in each block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10? 48 complete blocks, as before. So, units place: 48 times. Now, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, each complete range (like 80-89) contributes 10 times, but the last one only contributes 9 times. Let's count how many complete ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10) From 100-199: 180-189 (10) From 200-299: 280-289 (10) From 300-399: 380-389 (10) From 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 complete ranges contributing 10 each, and 1 partial range contributing 9. So, total for tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Now, hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's: 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me double-check the tens place for 8. I had 4 complete ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40+9=49. That seems right. And for 4's in the tens place, I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Units place for both digits: 48 each, which makes sense because 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete blocks. The hundreds place for 4 is 89, which is from 400 to 488 inclusive, so that's correct. And for 8, no hundreds place. So, 187-97=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 times (once per 10 numbers, 48 complete blocks).\n- **Tens place:** 50 times (10 times per each of 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times (400-488).\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 49 times (10 times per each of 4 ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, plus 9 times in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times.\n**Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each position one by one.\n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 numbers. In each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 blocks mean 48 times 4's in the units place. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at 484. So that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 80-89, which is 10 times. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and an extra 88 numbers (401-488). In each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred). So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the tens place here. From 401-409, the tens digit is 0. From 410-419, it's 1, and so on. The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449. But wait, our range is up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's 10 more times. Therefore, the total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNext, the hundreds place. In the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears 100 times each. Wait, no, actually, in the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears 100 times for each hundred. For example, 1 appears in 100-199, 2 in 200-299, etc. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but hold on, is that correct? Because from 400 to 488, each number starts with 4 in the hundreds place, so yes, 89 times. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, in 488 numbers, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 48 complete blocks (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each block, 8 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. In the extra 8 numbers, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place. In each block of 100, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89). So, in each complete hundred, that's 10 times. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.), so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489. But our range is up to 488, so that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. Therefore, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. The question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I missed something in the tens place for 4's or 8's.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place: I had 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, totaling 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place for 8's, I had 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 in the last 8 numbers, totaling 49. That's correct.\n\nFor 4's in the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. That seems right.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's total: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all the ranges correctly, especially in the tens and hundreds places.\n\nWait, for 4's in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 4's in hundreds place.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: since the book ends at 488, there's no page 800, so 0, correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately, making sure I didn't miss any.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach. Let me try that.\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated using the formula:\n\ncount = higher * 10^lower_digits + something based on the current digit and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, I can think of each digit place separately.\n\nLet me try the units place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488 / 10) = 48. Each group contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8. Then, the remainder is 8, so in the last partial group (481-488), how many 4's and 8's in units place? For 4's, 484 has a 4, so 1. For 8's, 488 has an 8, so 1.\n\nSo, units place: 4's = 48*1 +1=49, 8's=48*1 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100: floor(488 / 100)=4. Each group contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. Then, the remainder is 88.\n\nIn the remainder (0-88 in tens place, but actually 401-488), how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFor 4's: the tens digit is 4 when the number is between 400-409, 410-419, etc., but since we're in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more 4's.\n\nFor 8's: the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 +10=50, and 8's:4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nFor 8's: no numbers from 800-899, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, I think my initial calculation is correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place one by one. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then an extra 8 numbers. In each cycle, 4 appears once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial cycle (481-488), does 484 fall into that? Yes, because 484 is within 481-488. So, that adds one more, making it 49 times 4 in the units place. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles up to 8, so 484 is the 48th cycle, but 484 is actually the 48th occurrence? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 48, plus one if the last page is beyond 484. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is included. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears 48 times (once every 10 numbers) plus one more if the last page is beyond 480. Wait, no, because 484 is within 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the units digit 4 appears in 484, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, no, let's think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit is 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 as the units digit? It's the same as the number of complete decades (groups of 10) times 1, plus any extra in the last partial decade. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. The last partial decade is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's another 4, making it 49 times. Wait, but 484 is in the 48th decade, right? Because 480-489 is the 48th decade. But since the book ends at 488, 484 is included, so the units digit 4 appears 48 times from 1-480, and one more in 484, making it 49. So, units place: 49 times. Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds, each contributing one block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So, that's another 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 more. So, total tens digit 4's: 40 (from 1-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50. Wait, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more, making it 50. Now, let's check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, tens digit 4 appears 50 times. Now, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only when the number is 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's the number of numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now, let's do the same for 8's. I'll need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places from 1 to 488. Starting with the units place. Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. The last partial decade is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's another 8, making it 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. Now, tens place. The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds, each contributing one block of 10 where the tens digit is 8. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in all these, so that's 9 numbers. So, total tens digit 8's: 40 (from 1-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens digit 8 appears 49 times. Now, hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete decades and one partial decade (481-488) which includes 484.

    "text": " Wait, page numbers don't go beyond 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since 488 is the last page, the hundreds digit can be 4 only up to 488. Let me structure this properly. First, for the units place: In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once in the units place (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 groups times 1, plus in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 groups times 1, plus in the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's the same. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check again. For units digit 4: Each 10 numbers contribute 1, so 48 times 1 is 48, and then in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 49. Same for 8's: 48 times 1 plus 1 in the last group, so 49. So, units place contributes equally to both 4's and 8's. Now, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88. So, we have four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88, so the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500, but since we only go up to 488, the last hundred is incomplete. So, for each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So, for the first four complete hundreds (1-400), how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 for each digit. Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place only once here, from 440-449, which is 10 times. Wait, no, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place once, from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. Wait, but actually, when considering the tens digit, 480-488 is the tens digit 8, but how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each time the tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 times. So, in the partial hundred, 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place (480-488). Therefore, total for tens place: 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50. 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's are more by 1 in the tens place. Now, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. For each hundred, the hundreds digit is the same for all 100 numbers. So, in 1-99, there's no hundreds digit; 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive), so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 4's in hundreds place: 89 times. 8's in hundreds place: 0 times. Therefore, in the hundreds place, 4's are way more than 8's. Now, let's sum up all the occurrences. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 each.\n- The last 8 numbers (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n- **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n- **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each group of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- For 4's: 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40, plus 10 in 440-449.\n- For 8's: 4 complete hundreds contribute 40, plus 9 in 480-488.\n- **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n- **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n- **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can use a systematic approach for each digit place. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Let me calculate. The last number with a 4 in the units place is 484. So, starting from 4, each step is +10. The number of terms can be found by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, is that right? Let me check. 4,14,...,484. The difference is 480, divided by 10 gives 48 intervals, so 49 numbers. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. Now, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, from 1-100, it's 40-49, which is 10 times. From 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 times. So, how many hundreds do we have? From 1-400, that's four blocks of 100, but wait, 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, each hundred block is 100 numbers, so 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is 401-488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 times 10 is 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. Now, let's check the hundreds place. In the hundreds place, 4 appears in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. So, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. Starting with units place. 8 appears once every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. Now, tens place. 8 appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where 8 is in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks. From 1-100: 80-89, 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189, 10 numbers. 201-300:280-289, 10 numbers. 301-400:380-389, 10 numbers. 401-488:480-488. Now, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 -480 +1=9). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place is 40+9=49. Now, hundreds place. 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. When I was counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, four full blocks (each 10) and one partial block (9 numbers). So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but for 4's in the tens place, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, 50.\n\nFor hundreds place, 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nUnits place: 4's from 4,14,...,484. That's 48 intervals, so 49 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488, which is 49 numbers.\n\nSo, 4's total:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's total:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think if I made a mistake in counting. Maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, for the hundreds place, 4's: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nFor tens place, 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 times. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four are 10 each, last is 9, so 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place:49, correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each position one by one. For the units place: In every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each full set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 does. So that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. Now, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes ten 4's in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: from 1-99, there's one block (40-49). From 100-199, another block (140-149). From 200-299, another block (240-249). From 300-399, another block (340-349). From 400-488, another block (440-449). So that's five blocks. Each block contributes ten 4's, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does the last block go up to 449? Since 488 is beyond 449, so yes, 440-449 is a full block. So, that's 50 4's in the tens place. Now, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total 4's would be the sum of units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. Starting with the units place: similar to 4's, in every set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of ten and 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each full set contributes one 8, so 48 times. In the extra 8 numbers, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, the tens place: the digit 8 appears in blocks of ten, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes ten 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? From 1-99: one block (80-89). From 100-199: another block (180-189). From 200-299: another block (280-289). From 300-399: another block (380-389). From 400-488: another block (480-489), but since we're only going up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the block 480-489 isn't complete, but 480-488 is part of it. So, how many 8's in the tens place here? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers. So, total blocks with full ten 8's are four: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes ten 8's, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in 480-488, we have 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Now, the hundreds place: the digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 and 8 extra numbers. Each set contributes one 4, totaling 48. Additionally, 484 contributes one more 4, making it 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 40-49). There are five such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing ten 4's, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's.\n  \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets and 8 extra numbers. Each set contributes one 8, totaling 48. Additionally, 488 contributes one more 8, making it 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 80-89). There are four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing ten 8's, totaling 40. Additionally, 480-488 contributes nine more 8's, making it 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, for the tens place: Similarly, in every set of a hundred numbers, the digit 4 appears ten times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is ten numbers. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? That's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the four full hundreds, the tens digit is 4 ten times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is ten numbers. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, it does. So that's another 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Now, for the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 a total of 89 times. Wait, no, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of ten and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times in the units place, plus 1 more in the extra 8 numbers (488 has an 8 in the units place). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, tens place: In every set of a hundred, the tens digit is 8 ten times (e.g., 80-89). So, from 1-400, there are four full hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Now, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 to 8, so no 4's there. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages left (401-488). So, in each of the 4 full hundreds, there are 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Wait, actually, from 0 to 8 in the tens place because 488 is the last page. Wait, 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Well, in 401-410, the tens digit is 0, so no 4's. Then, in 411-420, tens digit is 1, so no. Similarly, 421-430: 2, 431-440: 3, 441-450: 4. Wait, 441-450: the tens digit is 4, so that's 10 numbers (441-450), but since we're only going up to 488, 441-450 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. Then, 451-460: tens digit 5, so no. 461-470: 6, no. 471-480: 7, no. 481-488: tens digit 8, so no 4's. So, in the remaining 88 pages, we have 10 more 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in each set of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so one more 8 (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). Now, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go up to 8 (480-488). So, in 401-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's in 480-488. The tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last 8 numbers where units digit is 8 (488), so 48 + 1 = 49. Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's, so 40, plus in the remaining 88 pages, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again: when counting the tens place in the remaining 88 pages, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, 9 more 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when counting 4's, I had 187, and 8's are 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Units place: 48, tens place: 50, so total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. In the remaining 88 pages, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the total number of 8's in the tens place as follows: Each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so for 4 full hundreds, that's 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, in 488 pages, the number of 8's is the number of times 8 appears in the units digit. Each 10 numbers contribute one 8, so 48 full tens, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 8 occurs once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.

    "text": " Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of each digit place. For each position (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times 4 appears. Similarly for 8. So, for the units place: In the units digit, how often does 4 appear? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last group is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. So in the 48th group, which is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 appears once in 484. So actually, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is indeed 48. Now, for the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. But wait, up to 488, so the last range is 440-449, which is fully included, right? Let me check: 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's 10 times. So how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49: 10 times. From 100-199: 140-149: 10 times. From 200-299: 240-249: 10 times. From 300-399: 340-349: 10 times. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 times. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. Now, for the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89), but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 times. Wait, no, wait. The hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. Units place: 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10? 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last group is 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so in 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once in 488. So total units place 8's: 48. Tens place: 8 appears in the tens digit in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 times the digit 8 in the tens place, except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 times. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So for the tens place: 80-89: 10 times. 180-189: 10 times. 280-289:10 times. 380-389:10 times. 480-488:9 times. So total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Now, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So hundreds place 8's: 0. So total number of 8's is units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units:48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units:48, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 8's:48+49=97. So 187-97=90. Hmm, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly for 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each 10 times. Then 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 times. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So total 8's:97. 4's:187. So difference is 90. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. Units place: 48 times, correct. Tens place: 50 times, correct. So 4's:187. 8's:97. Difference:90. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the range 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range (480-488) contributing 9 occurrences. Total tens place 8's = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in the range 1-488, contributing 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = **97**\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can use a systematic approach for each digit place. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4); in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial set (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Then, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. So, let's see how many hundreds we have in 488. That's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range. \n\nIn each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds would contribute 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on. Wait, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, when does the tens digit become 4? It's from 440-449. That's another 10 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is within that range. So, that's another 10. So, total tens digit 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is actually 88 numbers, which is 4 full tens (401-410, 411-420, etc.) and then 8 more. So, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that adds 10 more, making it 4*10 + 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, page numbers start at 1, so 400 is page 400, and 488 is the last page. So, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 times. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in each block of 10, the units digit is 8 once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Now, the partial block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many hundreds do we have? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 8 in 10 numbers each, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 8's in the tens place would be 49, but let me double-check. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. Units place: 48 from the complete blocks plus 1 in the partial block, totaling 49. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98.\n\nWait, but wait, when I counted units place 8's, I had 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, and then in 481-488, units digit 8 is at 488, so that's one more, making it 49. So, units place: 49. Tens place: 49. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting for 4's and 8's to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 (from 1-480) + 0 (481-488) = 48\n- Tens: 4 hundreds (1-400) each contribute 10, so 40, plus 10 in 440-449, so 50\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (488) = 49\n- Tens: 4 hundreds (1-400) each contribute 10, so 40, plus 9 in 480-488, so 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: total number of digits printed. Let's see, pages 1-9: 9 pages, 1 digit each: 9 digits. Pages 10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each: 180 digits. Pages 100-488: 389 pages, 3 digits each: 1167 digits. Total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, total number of 4's is 187, and 8's is 98, so total digits accounted for by 4's and 8's is 187 + 98 = 285. So, 285 out of 1356 digits are either 4's or 8's, which seems plausible.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? For every 10 numbers, once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), does 4 appear? No, because 484 is page 484, which is 4 in the units place? Wait, no, 484 is in the 481-488 range, so units digit is 4. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, earlier I said units place for 4's: 48 times from 1-480, and 0 from 481-488. But 484 is within 481-488, so units digit is 4, so that's one more. So, units place for 4's should be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, this changes things. So, I think I made a mistake earlier in the units place for 4's. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, units place for 4's:\n\nFrom 1-480: 480 / 10 = 48 times.\n\nFrom 481-488: numbers are 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488.\n\nIn this range, the units digit is 4 only at 484, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place:\n\nFrom 1-480: 48 times.\n\nFrom 481-488: units digit 8 is at 488, so one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by not including 484 in the units place for 4's. So, let's recalculate the total number of 4's and 8's.\n\nSo, correcting the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: as before, 50\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 49\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nSo, now the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so I initially thought 187 - 98 = 89, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it's 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me confirm again. From 1-488, units digit 4 appears 49 times, not 48. Because in 481-488, 484 is included, so that's one more. So, units place 4's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place is 49, same as before.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's total: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again for 4's. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct. So, tens place 4's: 50.\n\nUnits place 4's: 49\n\nHundreds place 4's: 89\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nUnits place 8's: 49\n\nTens place 8's: 49\n\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct now. I had initially missed the 484 in the units place for 4's, leading me to an incorrect count of 48 instead of 49 for units place 4's. So, the correct difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 consecutive numbers contribute one '4'.\n   - From 1 to 480: 480 / 10 = 48 occurrences.\n   - From 481 to 488: 484 has a '4' in the units place, adding 1.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488: 440-449 contributes 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488: 89 numbers, each with '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 consecutive numbers contribute one '8'.\n   - From 1 to 480: 48 occurrences.\n   - From 481 to 488: 488 has an '8' in the units place, adding 1.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488: 480-488 contributes 9 (since 488 is the end).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' appears 90 times more than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each of the 48 full blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for a block of 10 numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: from 1-99, there's one block (40-49). From 100-199, another block (140-149). From 200-299, another block (240-249). From 300-399, another block (340-349). And from 400-488, the block would be 440-449. So that's a total of 5 blocks. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but does the 440-449 block fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add those up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll use a similar approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Again, in each block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many full blocks of 10 are there in 488? As before, 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are there up to 488. From 1-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488, which is another block but only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, does 480-488 count as a full block? Since a block is 10 numbers, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, each full block contributes 10 8's, but the last block only contributes 9. So, how many full blocks are there? Up to 488, the full blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, the partial block from 480-488 contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The numbers from 480-488 have tens digit 8, right? So, 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's are 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the 8's in the tens place were 49, and units place 49, so total 98. But let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything.\n\nWait, in the tens place, I had four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 8's, so that's 4*10=40. Then, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 9. So, 40+9=49 in the tens place. Units place was 49, so 49+49=98 total 8's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. Each block of 10 contributes one 8 in the units place. There are 48 full blocks (since 488/10=48.8), so 48 8's in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more in 488. So, 48+1=49 in the units place. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: Each block of 10 contributes one 4. 488/10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, 48+1=49. That seems correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 8 appears once (488). So, 48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: None, since the book ends at 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4. There are 48 full blocks (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8) and an additional 4 in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each block like 40-49, 140-149, etc., contributes 10 4's. There are five such blocks, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Each block of 10 contributes one 8. There are 48 full blocks and an additional 8 in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each block like 80-89, 180-189, etc., contributes 10 8's. There are four full blocks and a partial block (480-488) contributing 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe it's easier to count the number of 4's in each position and then add them up. Similarly for 8's. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 489th group, we only have up to 488. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is indeed 48 times because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing a 4. Now, let me count the 4's in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49: that's one, then 140-149: two, 240-249: three, 340-349: four, and 440-449: five. So, five ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. Starting with units place: 8 appears once every 10 numbers, similar to 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? Again, 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing an 8. So, 48 8's in the units place. Now, the tens place: the tens digit is 8 for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range. So, how many full ranges? From 80-89: one, 180-189: two, 280-289: three, 380-389: four, and 480-488: five. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 40+9=49 8's in the tens place. Now, the hundreds place: the hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. So, 97 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full groups of 10 in 488, so 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's start with the units place. For every set of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). In 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 full sets of ten, and then a partial set from 481 to 488. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, each full set of ten is from 1-10, 11-20, etc., up to 481-490. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is incomplete. So, the number of full sets of ten is 48 (from 1-480), and then the last partial set is 481-488. So, in the units place, for each full set of ten, there's one 4. So, 48 sets mean 48 times 1, which is 48. Now, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at page 484. So, that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's count the number of 4's in the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. Similarly, this happens every hundred numbers. So, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Then, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so the last block would be 440-449, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check. From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, yes, five blocks, each with 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct. So, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. Starting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each set of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many full sets of ten are there? 48 full sets (1-480) and then 481-488. So, in each full set, 1 eight, so 48 eights. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8's. Similar to the 4's, the tens digit is 8 in blocks of ten: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full blocks are there? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, five blocks. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so that's 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), each with a tens digit of 8. So, that's 9 more. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8's. The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Because when I calculated the tens place for 8's, I got 49, and units place 49, so total 98. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 full sets, each contributing 1 eight, and then the last set (481-488) had one more eight at 488, so 48 +1 =49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) each have 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which has 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 -98=90. Hmm, but let me double-check because sometimes I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last set (481-488) has 484, which is one more, so 49. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: Units place: 48 full sets, 48 eights, plus 488, so 49. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, first four blocks contribute 4*10=40, and the last block contributes 9, so total 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 800-899, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. The block 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with a tens digit of 8. So, that's correct. So, 49 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, 400,401,...,488. So, yes, that's 89 pages.\n\nSo, adding up, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188 4's.\n\nFor 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the answer might be different, but let me see. Alternatively, maybe I should use a formula or another method to cross-verify.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor 4's: In each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, which is another 4. So, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: floor(488/10)=48, so 48 eights in units place, plus in the remaining 8 numbers, 488 is included, so one more, total 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: In each 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 10 times. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many hundreds are there? 488 /100=4 full hundreds (1-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each hundred, 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the last block was 440-449, which is within 488, so yes, 10 numbers. So, total 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: Similarly, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit 8 appears in 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nFor 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any 8's in the hundreds place. Since 488 is less than 800, there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8, so 0 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's five blocks. The first four are full blocks with 10 numbers each, contributing 40, and the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, five blocks, each with 10 numbers, contributing 50. That's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Similarly, in 11-20, it appears once at 14, and so on. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 48 blocks would give 48 fours. Now, in the partial block (481-488), let's check the units digits: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so 4 appears once at 484. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's count the number of 4's in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, which is another 10 numbers, and so on. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles again. Let's see: from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; 421-430, it's 2; 431-440, it's 3; 441-450, it's 4. Wait, so in 441-450, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 441-450. But wait, 488 is beyond 450, so actually, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 and 450-459, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I should consider how many times the tens digit is 4 in the range 401-488.\n\nWait, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 fours in the tens place. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, total 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is included, so 400-488 is 89 numbers, so yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is only 488 pages, so the total number of digits is 488 digits? Wait no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, each page number has up to three digits, so the total number of digits is more than 488. But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just add the counts correctly.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Then, the tens place: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? As I thought earlier, in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds would give 40, plus in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more, so total 50 fours in the tens place. Similarly, in the units place, we have 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial ten (481-488), another one, so 49 fours in the units place. So total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because 488 is 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4, so that's correct. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, that's five sets of 10, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 40 from the first four hundreds, and 10 from 440-449, so 50 in total. The units digit is 4 in 4,14,24,...,484, which is 49 times because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens and one more in the 480s, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place. In each block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each complete block, one 8, so 48 eights. In the partial block (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check: from 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 10 +10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights\n- 180-189: 10 eights\n- 280-289: 10 eights\n- 380-389: 10 eights\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488), so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. In the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, right? So, 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 also, up to 488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? From 4 to 484, step 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours. So, 5 ranges, each 10, so 50. But wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 eights, and the last has 9. So, 10*4 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 188 - 98 is 90, yes. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe it's easier to count the number of 4's in each position and then add them up. Same with the 8's. Let's start with the 4's. First, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. So, every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 full blocks of 10, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Wait, 484 is in the 480-489 range, right? So, page 484 would have a 4 in the units place. So that's one more 4 in the units place. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit changes every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, in this range, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full blocks of 10 (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but wait, 488 is less than 490, so the last block is 481-488, which is only 8 numbers. So, in each full block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. In the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, the tens place. In the tens place, 8 appears in blocks of 100. For example, in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many full blocks we have. From 1-488, the hundreds go up to 4, so we have 80-89 (first block), 180-189 (second), 280-289 (third), 380-389 (fourth), and 480-488 (fifth). So, that's five blocks. However, the last block (480-488) only has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), but wait, 488 is the last page. Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears in 480-488, but only for 9 numbers. So, does that mean 9 8's in the tens place for that block? Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all those numbers, so even though there are 9 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for each, so that's 9 8's. But earlier blocks (80-89, etc.) have 10 numbers each. So, let me count: first block 80-89: 10 8's in tens place. Second block 180-189: 10. Third block 280-289: 10. Fourth block 380-389: 10. Fifth block 480-488: 9. So total 8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, that's 49? Wait, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check if I counted correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's or 8's. Let me recount the tens place for 4's. In the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5*10=50. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50. That seems correct. For 8's in the tens place, as I did earlier, five blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, the last has 9, so 4*10 + 9=49. That seems correct. Units place: for both 4 and 8, it's 49 each. So, 4's total 188, 8's total 98. Difference is 90. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full blocks of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 instances.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one more 4 (page 484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), contributing 40 instances.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) include another 10 instances (440-449).\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 instances.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears once in every block of 10, contributing 48 instances.\n   - The remaining 8 pages include one more 8 (page 488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in blocks of 100, contributing 10 instances per block.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each place value one by one. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an additional 8 pages. So, in each of the 48 full blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Similarly, for every block of 100 numbers, the digit in the tens place cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the pages are 40-49, which is 10 pages. Then, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 pages, and so on. Now, how many full blocks of 100 are there in 488? There are four full blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the remaining pages are 401-488. Let's look at the tens place here. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in this range. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in 440-449, which is 10 pages. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNext, the hundreds place. In 1-99, there are no hundreds digits, so no 4's there. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. \n\nWait, let me check that again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's indeed 89 pages. So, each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. \n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many full blocks of 10 are there in 488? 48 full blocks, as before. So, that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once more in 488. So, total 8's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, in each block of 100, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, each block of 100 contributes 10 8's in the tens place. There are four full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, looking at the remaining pages, 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's there. So, 40 from the four blocks plus 9, which is 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. Now, how many more 4's than 8's? That would be 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I should recount each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks (each contributing 1) = 48, plus 1 in 484, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 blocks of 100 (each 10) = 40, plus 10 in 440-449, total 50.\n- Hundreds: 89 in 400-488.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks = 48, plus 1 in 488, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 blocks of 100 = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98 = 90. I think that's right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 '4'. There are 48 full blocks (480 pages) plus 8 more pages, giving 48 + 1 = 49 '4's.\n- **Tens place:** Each block of 100 contributes 10 '4's. Four blocks give 40, plus 10 in 440-449, totaling 50 '4's.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 '4's.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Each block of 10 contributes 1 '8'. 48 blocks plus 1 in 488 give 49 '8's.\n- **Tens place:** Each block of 100 contributes 10 '8's. Four blocks give 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49 '8's.\n- **Hundreds place:** No '8's as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think in terms of each digit place separately because the count depends on the position. Let me consider each digit place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times 4 appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and taking the integer part. Similarly for 8. But wait, 488 is not a multiple of 10, so I might have to adjust for the remaining numbers. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are and then add the extra numbers beyond that.\n\nSo, for the units place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place = (Total number of pages) // 10 * 1 (since each block of 10 has one 4) + extra if the remaining pages include a 4.\n\nSimilarly for 8.\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nTotal pages: 488\n\nNumber of complete tens: 488 // 10 = 48 (since 48*10=480). So, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for each position. But wait, no, actually, for each position, the digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is 48 times for each digit, but we have 488, which is 480 + 8. So, the last 8 numbers (481 to 488) will have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once more in 484, and 8 appears once more in 488. Wait, no, 484 is 480 +4, so the units digit is 4, and 488 is 480 +8, units digit is 8. So, the count for units place:\n\nFor 4: 48 times (from each block of 10) plus 1 more in 484, so total 49.\n\nFor 8: 48 times plus 1 in 488, so total 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1 to 480, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, yes, 49 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but actually, from 1 to 480, it's 480 numbers, so 480 /10 =48, so each digit appears 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers, so digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So, total units place: 48 +1=49 for 4, and 48 +1=49 for 8. So, same count so far.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in 0-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each (10-19 have 1 in tens place, etc.). So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nTotal pages:488, so 4 full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, actually, it's 4 hundreds blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so up to 488.\n\nSo, let's calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nFirst, from 1-99: the tens digit cycles 0-9 each 10 times, but for 1-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, and then 1-9 for 10-99. So, in 1-99, the digit 0 appears 9 times (for 1-9), and digits 1-9 each appear 10 times in the tens place (10-19 have 1, etc.). Wait, no, actually, from 1-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9 (9 numbers), and then 1-9 for 10-99 (each appearing 10 times). So, total for tens place:\n\n- 0: 9 times\n- 1-9: 10 times each\n\nBut since we're dealing with 1-488, let me adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of hundreds. Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 1-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, and 1-9 for 10-99. So, digits 1-9 each appear 10 times in the tens place from 10-99, and 0 appears 9 times in 1-9. But maybe it's more straightforward to consider that for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for 1-99, it's almost like a hundred, except the first 9 numbers have tens digit 0. Hmm, maybe I should separate the first 99 pages and then the rest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in the tens place across all page numbers.\n\nLet me try this approach:\n\nFor the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nWait, but 488 is 4*100 + 88, so 4 full hundreds and 88 extra pages.\n\nIn each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 480 +8, so the tens digit goes up to 8). Wait, 401-488: the tens digit starts at 0 (401-410), then 1 (411-420), up to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place in 401-488?\n\nLet's see:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0 to 7, they each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- 0:10\n- 1:10\n- 2:10\n- 3:10\n- 4:10\n- 5:10\n- 6:10\n- 7:10\n- 8:8\n\nSo, adding this to the 400 times from the four hundreds:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 40 times from the first 400 pages, and then in the last 88 pages:\n\n- 0:10\n- 1:10\n- 2:10\n- 3:10\n- 4:10\n- 5:10\n- 6:10\n- 7:10\n- 8:8\n\nSo, total for each digit in tens place:\n\n- 0:40 +10=50\n- 1:40 +10=50\n- 2:40 +10=50\n- 3:40 +10=50\n- 4:40 +10=50\n- 5:40 +10=50\n- 6:40 +10=50\n- 7:40 +10=50\n- 8:40 +8=48\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is included, so 488 has tens digit 8, so in the last 88 pages, 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, so 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the last 88 pages. So, total for 8 in tens place is 40 +8=48.\n\nSimilarly, for digits 0-7, each gets 10 more in the last 88 pages, so 40+10=50 each. But wait, 4 in the tens place in the last 88 pages is 10 times (441-450), so 40+10=50. So, for 4, it's 50 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place. So, for 4, it's 50 times in the tens place, and for 8, it's 48 times.\n\nSo, moving on, now I have the counts for units and tens places. Now, let's check the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds digit is only present in page numbers from 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit. Pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 1: 100-199: 100 numbers, so hundreds digit 1 appears 100 times.\n- 2: 200-299: 100 numbers, hundreds digit 2 appears 100 times.\n- 3: 300-399: 100 numbers, hundreds digit 3 appears 100 times.\n- 4: 400-488: 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89), so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nDigits 0,5-9 don't appear in the hundreds place in this book.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 appears 0 times (since 800-899 would be needed, but the book only goes up to 488)\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the counts for each digit in all three places.\n\nStarting with the number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 +50 +89 = 188\n\nNow, number of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 +48 +0 = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -97 =91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 488 pages. Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 appear once in units place. So, 48 full tens, which is 48*1=48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 488 pages, as calculated earlier, each digit 0-7 appears 50 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 48 times. So, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488), 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188\n\n8's:49 +48 +0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all page numbers correctly. For example, page 400: hundreds digit 4, tens digit 0, units digit 0. So, that's counted correctly. Similarly, page 444: hundreds 4, tens 4, units 4. Each occurrence is counted in their respective places.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the last 88 pages (401-488). I said that each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. But wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (401-410, 411-420, etc.) up to 481-490, but since we only go to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, each of the tens digits from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, that part is correct.\n\nAnother check: total number of digits printed.\n\nEach page number from 1-9: 1 digit each, total 9 digits.\n\nFrom 10-99: 2 digits each, total 90*2=180 digits.\n\nFrom 100-488: 3 digits each, total 389*3=1167 digits.\n\nWait, 488-100+1=389 pages. So, total digits:9 +180 +1167=1356 digits.\n\nNow, let's check the total number of 4's and 8's:\n\nNumber of 4's:188\n\nNumber of 8's:97\n\nTotal digits accounted for by 4's and 8's:188 +97=285\n\nBut 285 is much less than 1356, so that's okay.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if the counts for 4's and 8's make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as for each digit place:\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 488 pages, each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10)=48 times, plus the remainder.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, for units place, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), digits 1-8 appear once each. So, for 4 and 8, they each get an extra count, so 48+1=49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 488 pages. Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds (1-400) would have 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, but only 88 numbers. So, each digit 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, total for tens place:\n\n- 4:40 +10=50\n- 8:40 +8=48\n\nCorrect.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Only pages 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nSo, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total for 4: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total for 8: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the first 400 pages.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 occurrences each for digits 0-7 and 8 occurrences for 8.\n   - Total for 4: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total for 8: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have the hundreds digit 4 appearing 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total for 4: 89\n   - Total for 8: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I can use a systematic approach for each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, pages 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so no additional 4's here. So, units place gives me 48 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages each time. For example, pages 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is within 1-488. The next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours, so that's 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. Then from 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, but each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up: units place 48, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. Total fours = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, 400 to 488 is 89 pages, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So that's correct. So total fours: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to fours, in each set of 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last 8 pages are 481-488, and in the units place, we have 1-8, so 8 appears once more on page 488. So, units place gives 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages each time. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, let's count how many full blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block (10 pages). From 100-199: 180-189 is another block. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's four full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. Each full block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. The partial block contributes 9 eights in the tens place (pages 480-488). So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. Total eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Units place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last 8 pages, which include page 488, so units digit 8 appears once more, making it 49. Tens place: four full blocks of 10, each contributing 10 eights, so 40, plus the last block from 480-488, which is 9 pages with tens digit 8, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so total eights would be 98. But wait, in the units place, I have 49, and in the tens place, 49, so 98 in total. Now, the fours were 187, so the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the units place for fours. Let me recount the fours.\n\nUnits place for fours: Each 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. The last partial set is 481-488, which has units digits 1-8, so no 4's. So, units place: 48 fours.\n\nTens place for fours: Each block of 100 pages has 10 fours in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1-99: 40-49 is one block, contributing 10 fours.\n\nFrom 100-199: 140-149 is another block, 10 fours.\n\nFrom 200-299: 240-249, 10 fours.\n\nFrom 300-399: 340-349, 10 fours.\n\nFrom 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 fours, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another block, 10 fours.\n\nWait, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was five blocks, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place for fours: From 400-488, each page has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for the eights:\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. The last partial set is 481-488, which includes page 488, so units digit 8 appears once more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\nTens place: Blocks where tens digit is 8:\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89, 10 pages, 10 eights.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, 10 eights.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, 10 eights.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, 10 eights.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights.\n\nSo, that's 4 full blocks (each 10 eights) and one partial block (9 eights). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s, so no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, the number of fours is 187, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me recount the tens place for fours. Each block of 100 pages has one block where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 fours. From 1-99: 40-49, that's one block. 100-199: 140-149, another. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So that's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, we have four full blocks (each 10 eights) and one partial block of 9 eights, totaling 49. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, in the units place for eights, I have 49, and in the tens place, 49, so total 98 eights. Fours are 187, so 187 - 98 = 89. So, the answer is 89 more fours than eights.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the units place for fours again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94,104,...,484. So, every 10 pages, starting at 4. So, how many such numbers are there?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 fours. Then, in the last partial decade, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, which is 484. So, units digit 4 appears once more in 484. Wait, so that's 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, that's a mistake.\n\nWait, so maybe I made a mistake in the units place for fours. Let me recount.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Each 10 pages, starting at 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many such numbers are there?\n\nThe first occurrence is at 4, then every 10 pages. So, the last occurrence would be at 484, which is 484. Now, 484 is within 488, so that's included.\n\nSo, how many terms are in the sequence 4,14,24,...,484?\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The nth term is given by a_n = 4 + (n-1)*10.\n\nWe need a_n \u2264 488.\n\nSo, 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488\n\n(n-1)*10 \u2264 484\n\nn-1 \u2264 48.4\n\nn \u2264 49.4\n\nSo, n = 49. So, there are 49 terms where the units digit is 4. So, 49 fours in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. So, I must have made a mistake there.\n\nWait, so that changes things. So, units place for fours: 49, not 48. So, let me adjust that.\n\nSo, units place: 49 fours.\n\nTens place: 50 fours.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that's one more than before. So, I had 187 before, but now it's 188. So, that's a correction.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, let's see if I made a similar mistake.\n\nUnits place for eights: I had 49 eights. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each 10 pages, starting at 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nSo, the first occurrence is 8, then 18,28,...,488.\n\nHow many terms are there?\n\nThe nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488.\n\nSo, 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488\n\n(n-1)*10 \u2264 480\n\nn-1 \u2264 48\n\nn \u2264 49\n\nSo, n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. That's correct.\n\nTens place for eights: 49 eights as before.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, fours: 188, eights:98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so now the difference is 90. Hmm, so I had a mistake earlier in the units place for fours, which led to an incorrect total.\n\nWait, let me go through this again carefully.\n\nCounting fours:\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumbers ending with 4: 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence starting at 4, with a common difference of 10.\n\nThe nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488.\n\nSo, 4 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488\n\n10(n-1) \u2264 484\n\nn-1 \u2264 48.4\n\nn \u2264 49.4\n\nSo, n=49 terms. So, 49 fours in the units place.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.\n\nEach block contributes 10 fours. So, 5 blocks, 10 each: 50 fours.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumbers from 400-488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place: 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nCounting eights:\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumbers ending with 8: 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nSame as above, n=49 terms: 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nEach of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights.\n\nSo, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNo eights in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but after correcting the units place for fours, it's 90. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count of units place fours.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 such occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 pages, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), contributing 10 fours each.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 each have a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 fours (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 such occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 pages, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights, and a partial block 480-488 contributing 9 eights.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98 eights**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 fours - 98 eights = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can use a systematic approach for each digit place. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers go from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of the 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, giving 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (pages 481-488), we check if the units digit is 4. Page 484 has a 4 in the units place. So that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a range of 10 numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, and so on. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let me figure out how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is within 1-99. Then, the next blocks are 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block for 4 in the tens place is 440-449, because 480-489 would be beyond 488, but 440-449 is within 488. So, how many blocks is that? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNext, let's check the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402,..., up to 488. So yes, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed: 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place as well.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 pages. Each full block contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 \u00d7 1 = 48. Then, in the partial block (481-488), we check the units digits: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks we have.\n\nFirst block: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\nSecond block: 180-189: another 10.\nThird block: 280-289: another 10.\nFourth block: 380-389: another 10.\nFifth block: 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers (480 to 488). So, in the tens place, each of these 9 numbers has an 8, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss any. From 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. Yes, that adds up to 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place for 8's.\n\nEach block of 100 pages has a block where the tens digit is 8. So, in 1-100, it's 80-89: 10 numbers. Then, 101-200: 180-189: 10. 201-300:280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. Then, 401-488:480-488:9. So, that's 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that in the hundreds place, 8 doesn't appear, so that's correct.\n\nNow, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49. That seems correct because every 10 pages, one 4 in units, plus one in the last partial block.\n\nTens place: 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 5 blocks, but let me count again:\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nWait, that's 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. So, 49 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nThus, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems like a big number. Let me check if I'm counting correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me recount the hundreds place for 4's. Pages 400 to 488: that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 4's, I had 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. Let me make sure that's correct. From 40-49: yes, 10. 140-149:10. 240-249:10. 340-349:10. 440-449:10. So, that's 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: every 10 pages, one 4. So, 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, page 484 has a 4, so one more. Total 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, 481-488: 488 has an 8 in units place, so one more. Total 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. So, total 49.\n\nSo, 49+49=98 for 8's. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcounting the units place for 4's. Let me think again: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, it's every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there?\n\nThe sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n -6. Wait, no, let me think differently. The first term is 4, which is 10\u00d70 +4, the next is 14=10\u00d71 +4, then 24=10\u00d72 +4, etc. So, the last term is 484=10\u00d748 +4, because 48\u00d710=480, plus 4 is 484. So, the number of terms is 49, because starting from 0 to 48, that's 49 terms. So, 49 4's in units place. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 10\u00d748 +8. So, starting from 0 to 48, that's 49 terms. So, 49 8's in units place. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place, 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d710=50. Correct.\n\n8's in tens place: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. Each block except the last is 10 numbers, and the last is 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's from 400-488: 89 numbers. 8's: none, since 800-899 isn't in the book. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because 90 seems high, but I think the counting is correct. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to count digits is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nIn 1-488, how many 4's? As before, 49.\n\nSimilarly, how many 8's? 49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nIn 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, how many hundreds do we have? From 0-488, we have 5 hundreds: 0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred. So, in each full hundred (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So, 4 hundreds \u00d710=40.\n\nThen, in 400-488, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? From 400-409:10 numbers, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit is 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more. So, total 40 +10=50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: in each full hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (80-89,180-189, etc.), so 4 hundreds \u00d710=40.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nIn 1-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers. The hundreds digit is 8 for 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo, 4's in hundreds place:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units(49) + tens(50) + hundreds(89)=188.\n\n8's: units(49) + tens(49) + hundreds(0)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think this confirms it. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Total blocks of 10: 48 (pages 1-480) + 1 (pages 481-488) = 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - Total blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 pages, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - Total blocks of 10: 48 (pages 1-480) + 1 (pages 481-488) = 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences, except the last block which has 9 pages.\n   - Total blocks: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) + 1 partial block (480-488) = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages in 1-488 have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe that's the best way to avoid missing any numbers. Starting with the units place. For the units digit to be 4, the number would be 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last number ending with 4 would be 484. Now, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers there's a 4 in the units place. So, how many groups of 10 are there in 488? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole groups, there are 48 full groups of 10, and then the last partial group. Wait, but 484 is the last number ending with 4, which is 484. So, 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's 48 full groups plus one more. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. For each page number, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit is 4 exactly once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, in the 49th set, which would be 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so the units digit 4 occurs once more at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, actually, each complete set of 10 contributes one 4 in the units place, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full sets, each with one 4, so 48, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), there's another 4 at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 40-49 is one, 140-149 is another, up to 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, tens place 4's: 50. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4. That would be numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. Starting with units place. The units digit is 8. So, numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 88, so the last number with units digit 8 is 488. Now, how many such numbers are there? Each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), there's another 8 at 488. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, tens place. The tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is valid. So, how many such ranges? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Now, hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8. That would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, plus one more at 484.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contribute 10 numbers.\n   - There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers from 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, plus one more at 488.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contribute 10 numbers.\n   - There are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 numbers in 480-488.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I can use a systematic approach for each place. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, the 4 will appear once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Let me calculate 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 484? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that means there are 48 full groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. So, in those 48 groups, each contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The 4 in the tens place appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10 numbers. Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's 5 blocks in total, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400 is included, so yes, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but wait, let me add that up. So, units place: 48, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. So total number of 4's is 48+50+89. Let me compute that: 48+50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nStarting with units place. The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more (at 488). So total units place 8's: 48 +1 =49.\n\nNext, tens place. The digit 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count how many blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another block, 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total blocks: 4 blocks with 10 numbers each, and one block with 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, digit 8 appears 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98 total 8's. And earlier, I had 187 4's. So, the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers, the units digit is 4 once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times, plus in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 4 doesn't appear in units place. So, 48 units.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 40-49 is 10 numbers. So, 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488: 440-449 is 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. So, 50 in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, as 488-400+1=89. So, 89 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's:48+50+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. 488/10=48.8, so 48 times, plus in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 8 appears once at 488. So, 49.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 80-89 is 10 numbers. So, 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks with 10, and 1 block with 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: No numbers from 800-899, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something in the hundreds place for 8's, but no, it's correct because the book only goes up to 488, so no hundreds digit 8.\n\nSo, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488: 48 full groups, contributing 48 times.\n   - No additional 4's in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488).\n   - Total: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 48 full groups contribute 48 times.\n   - An additional 8 at 488.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - 4 full blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 400-488, 480-488 contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Let's start with the units place. For every group of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). Similarly, in 11-20, 4 appears once (page 14), and so on. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 full groups and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full groups, there's one 4 in the units place, totaling 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 484 is in this range, and the units digit is 4. So that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the next hundred (401-488). In each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds give 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers. So, 89 more 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. Starting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every group of ten, the digit 8 appears once. So, in 488 pages, how many full groups of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, totaling 48. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred contributes 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so for 4 full hundreds (1-400), that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each group of ten numbers contributes one 4.\n   - There are 48 full groups (480 pages) with 48 fours.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one more 4 (page 484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes ten 4's (e.g., 40-49).\n   - Four full hundreds (400 pages) contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each group of ten contributes one 8.\n   - 48 full groups give 48 eights.\n   - The remaining pages (481-488) include one more 8 (page 488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes ten 8's (e.g., 80-89).\n   - Four full hundreds contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 480-488, adding 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can use a systematic approach for each digit place. Starting with the units place. For the units digit, the 4 will appear once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, let's calculate how many such numbers there are. The first 4 in the units place is 4, and the last would be 484. To find how many, I can use division. 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. Now, moving on to the tens place. The 4 in the tens place appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's see how many full groups of 100 we have. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49). How many hundreds do we have? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is only 88 pages, so the tens digit 4 in 400-488 would be 40-49, but since it's 400-488, that's 400-409, 410-419, etc., but the 4 in the tens place is only from 400-409, right? Wait no, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419 would have 1 in the tens place, so actually, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs only once, from 400-409. Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. The tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so 480-488 is only up to 488, so the tens digit 4 in 480-488 is only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, so the tens digit 4 in the 400s would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. Then, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So, let me recast this. For the tens digit 4:\n\n- 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 times. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is correct. So, 5 sets \u00d710 = 50 times. Hmm, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total 50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, so 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last, so the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll use a similar approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nThe first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of times is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, the tens place. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times.\n\nEach hundred block from 0-99, 100-199, etc., has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 480-489 would be 10, but we stop at 488)\n\nSo, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check: 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10, 100-199: 180-189 is 10, 200-299: 280-289 is 10, 300-399: 380-389 is 10, and 400-488: 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 48.4 \u2192 48 full steps, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=48.8\u219248 full steps, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9). Total 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times (since 800-899 is beyond 488).\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can use a systematic approach for each digit place. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such groups are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten and an extra 8 pages. So, in each group of ten, the units digit is 4 once, so 48 times, and then in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nWait, let me check that. From 1 to 480, that's 48 groups of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers, and the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, yes, 48 + 1 = 49 units place 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes ten 4's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, let's see. The first block is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 count? Since the book goes up to 488, yes, 440-449 is within 488. So, how many blocks is that? That's five blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, from 440-449, that's ten numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me double-check. From 0-99, the tens digit 4 appears once in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then from 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, actually, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many 4's in the hundreds place? It's 89 times, but wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these numbers, so each number contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll count the number of 8's in each place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each group of ten, the units digit 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many groups of ten? 48 full groups and a partial group of 8. So, 48 times 1 for each group, plus 1 in the partial group (at 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check: from 1-480, that's 48 groups of ten, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, 481-488 includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, yes, 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the block. So, each block contributes ten 8's in the tens place, except maybe the last one.\n\nLet's count the number of blocks. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block, contributing 10 8's. Then 180-189, another block, 10 8's. 280-289, another block, 10 8's. 380-389, another block, 10 8's. Then, 480-488, which is part of the 480-489 block, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 times in this last block.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block of 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me verify. From 0-399, there are four blocks of ten where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 8's, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 8's in the tens place here. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total 8's printed are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For the tens place, I had 49 8's, and units place 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go back through each step.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49. Let's see: from 1-488, every ten has one 4 in units, so 48 full tens (1-480) gives 48, plus 484 in the last 8 numbers, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 5 blocks of ten where tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49. From 1-488, every ten has one 8 in units, so 48 full tens (1-480) gives 48, plus 488 in the last 8 numbers, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 4 blocks of ten where tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: No page numbers have 8 in hundreds place since the book ends at 488. So, 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check: 188 - 98 is indeed 90. Hmm, that seems correct.

Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 484 would have a 4 in the units place. That's one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10, and so on. Let's see how many hundreds we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and then 88 extra pages (401-488). Each complete hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, as before, 48 complete sets of 10 and 8 extra numbers. Each set contributes one 8, so 48 times. In the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8. That's one more. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each of these ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's calculate how many complete hundreds we have. From 1-400, there are four complete hundreds. In each, the tens digit 8 appears once, contributing 10 8's each time. So, 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 more. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 4's. Additionally, 484 adds one more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each range contributes 10 4's. With 4 complete hundreds, that's 40 4's. In 401-488, 440-449 adds another 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete sets, contributing 48 8's. Additionally, 488 adds one more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each range contributes 10 8's.

    "text": " Maybe I can use a systematic approach for each digit place. Let's start with the units place. For every group of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups of ten and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, plus one more in the last partial group (which is 481-488, so 484 has a 4 in the units place). Wait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial group, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only number where the units digit is 4. So, that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. Each full group of ten contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 groups would contribute 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 instances. How many hundreds do we have? From 1-488, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the four full hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last). So, in this partial hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Now, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers where the hundreds place is 4, which is from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, the number of times 4 appears in the hundreds place is 89. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. Starting with units place: similar to 4's, in each group of ten, the units digit is 8 exactly once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, tens place: similar to 4's, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, for each full hundred, that's 10 times. There are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles up to 8. So, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, how many 8's are there? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. Now, hundreds place: the hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's: units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 8's in the tens place. Let me check that again. In the tens place, for each full hundred, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 full hundreds give 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, that's 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I think about page numbers, sometimes edge cases can trip me up. Let me think about the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many such numbers? The last one is 484, which is 48 * 10 + 4. So, that's 48 times, but wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because it's 0-480, which is 48 times, plus 484. So, 49 times. Similarly, 8's in the units place: 8,18,28,...,488. So, 488 is included, so that's 49 times. So, that's correct. For the tens place, 4's: in each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds, so 40, plus in the last partial hundred, 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so total 50. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10. So, 4 hundreds, 40, plus in the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so total 49. So, that seems correct. For the hundreds place, 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8's in the hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full groups of ten (1-480) contributing 48 times, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus 10 in 440-449, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times in 400-488.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think about each digit place separately because the occurrence of a digit can vary depending on the place. So, for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times 4 appears and then do the same for 8. Let me start with the units place. For the units digit, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4), in 11-20, it appears once (at 14), and so on. Similarly, for 8, it's the same. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). So, for each digit (4 and 8), in the units place, they each appear 48 times in the complete blocks. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place counts: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is included, so the units digits go up to 8, which includes both 4 and 8 once. So, that's correct. Now, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in the next block, 140-149, and so on. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, in each 100-page block, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49). How many complete 100-page blocks are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488. So, in each complete block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, 2 for 420-429, 3 for 430-439, 4 for 440-449, 5 for 450-459, 6 for 460-469, 7 for 470-479, and 8 for 480-488. Wait, but we're looking for the tens digit being 4. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here as well. So, total tens place counts for 4: 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 (from partial block) = 50. Now, for the digit 8 in the tens place. Similarly, in each 100-page block, 8 appears in the tens place from 80-89, which is 10 times per block. So, in 4 complete blocks, that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial block. Therefore, total tens place counts for 8: 40 + 9 = 49. So, so far, for units and tens places, 4's are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, and 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Wait, no, that's not right because I think I'm adding the units and tens separately, but maybe I should consider each digit place separately and then sum them up. Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me correct that. Actually, I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately and then add them up for each digit. So, let me redo this.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, wait. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, for the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but that seems off because earlier, in the tens place, for 8, I had 40 from complete blocks and 9 from the partial block, totaling 49. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188 - 98 is 90, but I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go through each digit place again for 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with 4:\n\nUnits place: In each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1-488, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 times, plus in the partial block 481-488, 4 appears once (at 484). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10. So, total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow for 8:\n\nUnits place: Similarly, in each 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 48 complete blocks give 48 times, plus in the partial block 481-488, 8 appears once (at 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In each 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. In the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 8. In the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSo, all counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? For 4, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. For 8, since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 4.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 numbers) and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences of 4 (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (400 numbers) contributing 40 occurrences.\n   - In the partial block (401-488), 440-449 contributes another 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to 4, each block of 10 contributes 1 occurrence.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences (e.g., 80-89).\n   - 4 complete blocks contribute 40.\n   - In the partial block (401-488), 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No occurrence since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe it's easier to count the number of 4's in each position and then add them up. Similarly, I'll do the same for 8's. Let me start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in 1-10, the units digit is 4 once (page 4) and 8 once (page 8). Then, this pattern repeats every 10 pages. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in each group of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Therefore, for 48 complete groups, that's 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Then, we have the remaining 8 pages: 481-488. Let's check the units digits here: 481 has 1, 482 has 2, 483 has 3, 484 has 4, 485 has 5, 486 has 6, 487 has 7, 488 has 8. So, in these extra pages, we have one more 4 (page 484) and one more 8 (page 488). So, in the units place, total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, same count here. Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, right? So, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Similarly, 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let me figure out how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each time the tens digit is 4, it appears 10 times in a hundred (e.g., 40-49). So, how many such hundreds are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five sets. Each set contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 sets * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 pages, not 10. So, for 8's in the tens place, we have four complete sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, but only for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49. So, for the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49. So, 4's are one more here. Now, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. So, how many 4's are in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. For 8's in the hundreds place, we need to see if any page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. But since the book is 488 pages, the hundreds digit goes up to 4 (since 488 is 4 in the hundreds place). So, 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800 and above, which don't exist here. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, 4's in the hundreds place: 89, 8's: 0. So, 4's are way more here. Now, let me sum up the total number of 4's and 8's across all digit places. Let's start with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 pages. There are 48 full groups of 10 and an additional 8 pages. In each group, 4 appears once, and in the extra pages, it appears once. Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in sequences like 40-49, occurring 10 times per hundred. There are five such sequences (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Total tens place 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages. Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 pages, similar to 4. Total units place 8's: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in sequences like 80-89, occurring 10 times per hundred. There are four full sequences (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 40. Additionally, 480-488 adds 9 more. Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit since the book ends at 488. Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe that's a better way to approach it. \n\nFirst, for the units place: How many times does 4 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Well, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, for example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The total number of units digits is 488, so dividing by 10 gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 48 full groups and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In those extra 8 numbers, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, units place gives 48 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so the last hundred would be 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see, from 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 times. But wait, let me confirm: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 488 is beyond 449, so maybe I don't need to adjust anything because 440-449 is fully included in 400-488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, units place gives 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nNext, the tens place: How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers in each hundred: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Let me count how many full sets we have. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me make sure: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. Hmm, but earlier I thought maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, let me recount the units place for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then the last partial group (481-488) includes 8 as the units digit in 488. So, that's 48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: as above, 49. So, total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let's think about each digit place separately.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:187\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Each group contributes 1 four, so 48 fours.\n   - The last partial group (481-488) doesn't add another 4 in the units place.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 5 such sets in 488 pages: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.\n   - Each set contributes 10 fours, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From page 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - Each group contributes 1 eight, so 48 eights.\n   - The last partial group (481-488) includes 488, adding 1 more.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 full sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The last set (400-488) includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, which is beyond 488.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's: 187\n- Number of 8's: 98\n- **Difference:** 187 - 98 = **89**\n\n**Answer:** There are \\boxed{89} more 4's printed than 8's."

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each place value one by one. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, the 4 can appear in every set of ten numbers. For example, in 1-10, it's at 4; 11-20, it's at 14; and so on. So, in each block of ten numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of ten and then a partial block from 481 to 488. So, in each of the 48 full blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial block from 481-488, I need to check if there's a 4 in the units place. Looking at 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place here. So that's one more 4. So total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49. Now, moving on to the tens place. The 4 in the tens place appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each of these blocks has ten numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are in 488 pages. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, another 10. Then 340-349, another 10. Next would be 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, right? Because 449 is less than 488. So that's another 10. Now, after 449, the next block would be 540-549, but 540 is beyond 488, so we don't have that. So how many blocks do we have? Let's count: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. So that's 5 * 10 = 50. Now, I should check if there's any partial block beyond 449. Wait, 449 is 449, and the next number is 450, which is 450, so the tens digit changes to 5. So, no partial block beyond 449 where the tens digit is 4. So, total 4's in the tens place are 50. Now, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's in the hundreds place are 89. Now, adding up the 4's in units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, the total number of 4's printed is 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. I'll go through each place value again: units, tens, and hundreds. Starting with the units place. Similar to 4's, the 8 in the units place appears once every ten numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the partial block from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is the only number with an 8 in the units place. So that's one more 8. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49. Next, the tens place. The 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, let's count the blocks: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, total 8's in the tens place would be 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. So, total 8's in the hundreds place are 0. Now, adding up the 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, total number of 8's printed is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - From 1 to 488, every block of ten numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has one '4' in the units place. \n     - Total blocks of ten: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place one by one. For the units place: In each set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, does the 488th page affect this? Let me check. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In those extra numbers, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. Each set of 10 pages contributes exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? It's 488 // 10, which is 48, and then the remainder is 8. So, 48 sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once in 484. So total 4's in units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that seems correct. Now, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, from 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond that. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but wait, from 1-99, 40-49 is 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 times, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. Now, moving on to the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. In each set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers are 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, another 10.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 10 (from 1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 10+10=20, 20+10=30, 30+10=40, 40+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, 480 is the first, and 488 is the last, so that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, it's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I counted 4's in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 10 numbers each, totaling 5 sets, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can use a systematic approach for each digit place. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, the 4 will appear once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. In each full cycle, 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49. Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each cycle, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many such cycles are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full cycles and then 88 extra numbers. In each full cycle, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (from 400 to 488), the tens digit can be 0-8. So, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, adding that, the total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50. Next, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles and 8 extra numbers. In each cycle, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, tens place. Again, each cycle of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full cycles (1-400), so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit can be 0-8. So, 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, that's 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Now, hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 8's in the hundreds place are 0. So, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. That seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full cycles of 10 (480 numbers) plus 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each cycle contributes 1 four, totaling 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n   \n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149). There are 4 full cycles (400 numbers) contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), 440-449 contributes another 10 fours. Total: 40 + 10 = 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Thus, 89 fours.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. Total: 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in each cycle of 100. There are 4 full cycles contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), 480-488 contributes 9 eights. Total: 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Thus, 0 eights.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should also consider each range separately: 1-99, 100-399, and 400-488. That might make it easier to count without missing any numbers. \n\nFirst, let's consider the numbers from 1 to 99. In this range, each page number is either a one-digit or two-digit number. I'll count how many times 4 appears in the units place and how many times it appears in the tens place. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers where 4 is in the units place are 4, 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 10 numbers. So, 10 times the digit 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 99. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers where 4 is in the tens place are 40-49. That's 10 numbers (40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49). So, another 10 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. \n\nSo, in total, from 1 to 99, the digit 4 appears 10 + 10 = 20 times. \n\nNow, let's move on to the numbers from 100 to 399. These are all three-digit numbers. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nStarting with the hundreds place: In the range 100-399, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, no, up to 399, so the hundreds digit goes from 1 to 3. So, 4 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in this range. So, 0 times for the hundreds place. \n\nNow, the tens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. So, for each hundred, that's 10 times. Since there are 3 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), that's 3 * 10 = 30 times in the tens place. \n\nSimilarly, the units place: For each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the units place 10 times: e.g., 104,114,124,...,194; similarly for 200s and 300s. So, 10 times per hundred, times 3 hundreds, that's another 30 times in the units place. \n\nSo, from 100-399, the digit 4 appears 0 (hundreds) + 30 (tens) + 30 (units) = 60 times. \n\nNow, moving on to the numbers from 400 to 488. These are also three-digit numbers, so let's check each digit place. \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. \n\nTens place: Now, let's look at the tens digit. The numbers go from 400 to 488. The tens digit can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Let's consider each possible tens digit and see how many times 4 appears in the tens place. \n\nWait, but actually, I'm counting how many times 4 appears in the tens place. So, in the range 400-488, the tens digit can be 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 when the number is from 440 to 449. That's 10 numbers: 440,441,...,449. So, 10 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. \n\nUnits place: Now, the units digit can be 0-9 for each tens group. So, in each set of 10 numbers (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Let's see how many such groups there are. From 400 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 groups (0-8). Wait, but 488 is the last number, so the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the units digit can still go up to 8. So, in each group, the units digit 4 appears once, except maybe the last group if it's cut short. \n\nWait, let me check. From 400 to 488, each tens group (like 400-409, 410-419, etc.) has 10 numbers, except the last one, which is 480-488, which has 9 numbers. So, in the tens groups from 400-409 up to 470-479, each has 10 numbers, so the units digit 4 appears once in each, so that's 8 groups (tens digits 0 to 7) with 10 numbers each, and then the last group is 480-488, which has 9 numbers. \n\nWait, but actually, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 groups. Let me list them:\n\n- 400-409: units digits 0-9, so 4 appears once at 404\n- 410-419: 414\n- 420-429: 424\n- 430-439: 434\n- 440-449: 444\n- 450-459: 454\n- 460-469: 464\n- 470-479: 474\n- 480-488: units digits 0-8, so 484 is included.\n\nSo, in each of these 9 groups, the units digit 4 appears once, except perhaps the last group if 484 is included. Wait, 484 is within 480-488, so yes, it's included. So, that's 9 times in the units place. \n\nSo, the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place from 400-488. \n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-409, 404 is there; 410-419, 414; 420-429, 424; 430-439, 434; 440-449, 444; 450-459, 454; 460-469, 464; 470-479, 474; and 480-488, 484. That's 9 instances. So, yes, 9 times in the units place. \n\nSo, in the range 400-488, the digit 4 appears:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\n- Tens place: 10 times (from 440-449)\n- Units place: 9 times (as above)\n\nSo, total 4's from 400-488: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. 89 in the hundreds place, that's correct because each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, and there are 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n\nIn the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nIn the units place, as we saw, 9 times.\n\nSo, 89 + 10 + 9 = 108.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought from 100-399, 4's appeared 60 times, and from 1-99, 20 times, so total 4's would be 20 + 60 + 108 = 188 times.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 1-99: 20 times.\n\nFrom 100-399: 60 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: 108 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 20 + 60 + 108 = 188.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, from 100-399, I counted 60 times. But when I'm counting from 400-488, I'm including 400-488, which is correct. So, adding up, 20 + 60 + 108 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: count how many times 8 appears in each range.\n\nFirst, from 1-99:\n\nUnits place: Numbers ending with 8: 8, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times in the units place.\n\nTens place: Numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, from 1-99, 8's appear 10 + 10 = 20 times.\n\nNow, from 100-399:\n\nHundreds place: 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place here because the hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3. So, 0 times.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. So, 10 times per hundred, times 3 hundreds, that's 3 * 10 = 30 times in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, the units digit is 8 for 10 numbers: e.g., 108,118,128,...,198; same for 200s and 300s. So, 10 times per hundred, times 3, that's 30 times in the units place.\n\nSo, from 100-399, 8's appear 0 + 30 + 30 = 60 times.\n\nNow, from 400-488:\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4, so 8 doesn't appear here. 0 times.\n\nTens place: The tens digit can be 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are from 480-488. But wait, 480-488 is within 400-488, so how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. But wait, the tens digit is 8 only when the number is 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, 9 times in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: Now, for each tens group, the units digit can be 0-9. So, in each group where the tens digit is 0-8, the units digit 8 appears once. Let's see how many groups there are. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 groups (400-409, 410-419,...,480-488). \n\nIn each group, the units digit 8 appears once, except maybe the last group if it's cut short. Wait, in the last group, 480-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, in each group, the units digit 8 appears once. So, 9 groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 9 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check each group:\n\n- 400-409: 408\n- 410-419: 418\n- 420-429: 428\n- 430-439: 438\n- 440-449: 448\n- 450-459: 458\n- 460-469: 468\n- 470-479: 478\n- 480-488: 488\n\nYes, that's 9 instances where the units digit is 8. So, 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, from 400-488, 8's appear:\n\n- Tens place: 9 times (480-488)\n- Units place: 9 times (as above)\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\n\nSo, total 8's from 400-488: 9 + 9 = 18 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nFrom 1-99: 20 times\n\nFrom 100-399: 60 times\n\nFrom 400-488: 18 times\n\nTotal 8's: 20 + 60 + 18 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 400-488. When the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times in the tens place. Similarly, in the units place, it's 9 times. So, 9 + 9 = 18 times. So, total 8's: 20 + 60 + 18 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought from 100-399, 8's were 60 times, which is correct because 30 in tens and 30 in units. From 1-99, 20 times. From 400-488, 18 times. So, 20 + 60 + 18 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because 90 seems high.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\nFrom 1-99: 20 times.\n\nFrom 100-399: 60 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: 108 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 20 + 60 + 108 = 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nFrom 1-99: 20 times.\n\nFrom 100-399: 60 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: 18 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 20 + 60 + 18 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the 400-488 range again because that's where most of the 4's come from.\n\nIn 400-488:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 numbers, each with a 4. So, 89 times.\n\n- Tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\n- Units place: 404,414,...,484. From 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see:\n\nFrom 400-488, the units digit is 4 at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times, right? Because 488 is the last number, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, 89 + 10 + 9 = 108. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in 400-488:\n\n- Tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\n- Units place: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times.\n\nSo, 9 + 9 = 18. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. Difference: 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big number, but maybe it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this problem differently, perhaps by looking at each digit place separately across all numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me try that approach to cross-verify.\n\nFirst, count the number of 4's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nUnits place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the units place from 1 to 488?\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers, which is 48 full blocks of 10 (1-10, 11-20, ..., 480-488). Wait, no, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each full block of 10, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 blocks * 1 = 48 times.\n\nIn the partial block (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 20 + 60 + 108 = 188, which included units, tens, and hundreds. But according to this method, units place 4's are 49. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, perhaps my earlier method was wrong.\n\nWait, let me check this again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds do we have?\n\nWe have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 20 (from 1-99) + 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 60 in the tens place. Hmm, but according to this method, it's 50. So, there's a discrepancy. Let me figure out where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial approach was incorrect. Let me try this digit-by-digit approach more carefully.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-99: The tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit is 4 for 140-149, which is 10 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: 240-249, 10 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: 340-349, 10 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: 440-449, 10 times.\n\nSo, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 times. So, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought from 1-99, tens place 4's were 10, from 100-399, 30 (10 per hundred), and from 400-488, 10, totaling 50. So, that's correct. So, my initial approach was correct, and this digit-by-digit approach also gives 50. So, perhaps in the units place, I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, earlier I thought units place 4's were 49, but according to the initial approach, it was 20 (from 1-99) + 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 59. But according to the digit-by-digit approach, it's 49. So, there's a discrepancy. I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nLet me try to reconcile this.\n\nIn the initial approach, I considered:\n\nFrom 1-99: 10 units place 4's.\n\nFrom 100-399: 10 units place 4's per hundred, so 3 * 10 = 30.\n\nFrom 400-488: 9 units place 4's.\n\nTotal: 10 + 30 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that's 49, not 59. Wait, I think I added wrong earlier. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 1-99: 10 units place 4's.\n\nFrom 100-399: 30 units place 4's.\n\nFrom 400-488: 9 units place 4's.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 10 + 30 + 9 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, tens place 4's: 50.\n\nHundreds place 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48 times. In the partial block (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: How many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, 10 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, 10 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, 10 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that might be high, but according to both methods, it's consistent. So, I think the answer is 90.\n\nBut let me just check once more, because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small program or use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears up to a certain number, but since I can't do that right now, I'll rely on my manual calculations.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 '4' in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full blocks of 10, contributing 48 '4's.\n   - The partial block (481-488) contributes 1 more '4' (at 484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of '4' in the tens place.\n   - From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Each contributes 10 '4's, except the last block (400-488), which contributes 10 '4's (440-449).\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400-488, every number has '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - There are 89 numbers, so 89 '4's.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to '4's, each block of 10 contributes 1 '8'.\n   - From 1-488, 48 full blocks contribute 48 '8's.\n   - The partial block (481-488) contributes 1 more '8' (at 488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of '8' in the tens place.\n   - From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Each contributes 10 '8's, except the last block (400-488), which contributes 9 '8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can use a systematic approach for each digit place. Starting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times. But wait, in each set of 10, it's exactly once, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last set is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the 488 is included, so does that affect the count? Hmm, actually, no, because in the units place, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 481 has a 1, 482 has 2, up to 488, which has 8. So, the digit 4 doesn't appear in the units place in the last partial set. So, it's still 48 times in the units place. Now, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 40-49 is 10 numbers, so one 4 in the tens place for each of these, so that's 10 times. Then, 140-149 is another 10, so 10 more. Similarly, 240-249 is another 10, so 10, and 340-349 is another 10. Then, 440-449 is another 10, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is 440, which is within 488, so yes, that's another 10. So, adding these up: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is included, so that's correct. So, the digit 4 appears 50 times in the tens place. Now, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. Starting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set, from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8, making it 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, so 48 eights. Then, from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-489 is only up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 eights. 180-189 is another 10, so 10. 280-289 is another 10, so 10. 380-389 is another 10, so 10. Now, 480-489: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, adding these up: 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place 48, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. 48+50=98, +89=187. For the 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 187-98=89. That seems correct. So, the answer should be 89.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, contributing 48 occurrences. The last 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any more 4's in the units place.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), contributing 10 occurrences each, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 480, there are 48 occurrences. The last 8 numbers (481-488) include one more 8 (488), totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), and in the last partial set (480-488), contributing 9 occurrences. Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49**.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think about each digit place separately for each position in the number. For example, in a three-digit number, there's the hundreds place, tens place, and units place. But for two-digit numbers, it's just tens and units, and for single-digit, just units. Maybe a better approach is to consider each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, in the range 1-488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for 48 complete groups, that's 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. Now, the remaining 8 numbers: 481-488. Let me list them: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding that to the previous count: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8 in the units place. Wait, but that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8. So, in the incomplete group, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, total units place: 49 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100. So, for example, from 0-99, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, from 100-199, 200-299, etc. But since our book goes up to 488, which is less than 500, I need to adjust for that.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many complete hundreds we have. From 1-99: that's one hundred. Then 100-199: another hundred, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is not a complete hundred, it's 89 pages. So, let's break it down:\n\nFor each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each, except for the last block which is incomplete.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- 0-99: 10 occurrences of each digit 0-9 in the tens place.\n- 100-199: same, 10 each.\n- 200-299: same.\n- 300-399: same.\n- 400-488: Let's see, from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? From 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 times. 410-419: 1, 10 times. ... up to 480-488: tens digit 8, but only 9 times because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last block.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, appearing 9 times because we only go up to 488.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. For 400-488, the tens digits are as follows:\n\n- 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 numbers.\n- 410-419: tens digit 1, 10 numbers.\n- 420-429: tens digit 2, 10 numbers.\n- 430-439: tens digit 3, 10 numbers.\n- 440-449: tens digit 4, 10 numbers.\n- 450-459: tens digit 5, 10 numbers.\n- 460-469: tens digit 6, 10 numbers.\n- 470-479: tens digit 7, 10 numbers.\n- 480-488: tens digit 8, 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers).\n\nSo, in the tens place for 400-488, each digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place across all page numbers?\n\n- In 0-99: 10 times (40-49).\n- In 100-199: 10 times (140-149).\n- In 200-299: 10 times (240-249).\n- In 300-399: 10 times (340-349).\n- In 400-488: 10 times (440-449).\n\nWait, but in 400-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. So total for 4 in tens place: 10 (0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\n- In 0-99: 10 times (80-89).\n- In 100-199: 10 times (180-189).\n- In 200-299: 10 times (280-289).\n- In 300-399: 10 times (380-389).\n- In 400-488: 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total for 8 in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Each of the first four blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 times for 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, it's 9 times. So total 40+9=49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers, i.e., from 100 to 488.\n\nThe hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: 100-199, which is 100 numbers. So, 1 appears 100 times in the hundreds place.\n- Similarly, 2: 200-299, 100 times.\n- 3: 300-399, 100 times.\n- 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89).\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Only in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's total up the counts for each digit.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in units place.\n- There are 48 complete groups (480 numbers) and then 8 extra (481-488).\n- In the complete groups: 48*1=48 for 4 and 8 each.\n- In the extra 8 numbers: 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, +1 each.\n- Total units: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4: in each hundred block, 10 times. There are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, but for the tens digit, in each full hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. In 400-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so another 10 times. So, 5*10=50. That seems right.\n\n- For 8: same logic, except in the last block (400-488), the tens digit 8 only appears 9 times (480-488). So, 4*10=40 for the first four blocks, plus 9 in the last block, total 49. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 never appears here. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let's start with the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, pages 4, 14, 24, etc. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. So, in each of these 48 sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, giving 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in page 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49. Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 for each set of 10 pages. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, for each of the first 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. That's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 0-8, so the digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? Yes, so that's another 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each set of 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets and 8 extra pages. Each set contributes 1, so 48 times. In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, the tens place. Again, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds in 488 pages, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's pages 480-488. How many pages is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 pages (including both ends). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all these pages. So, that's 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488. That's 9 pages, so 9 times. So, 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems right. So, yes, 98 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n1. **Units Place:** In every set of 10 pages, 4 appears once. There are 48 full sets (480 pages) and 8 extra pages. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens Place:** In every 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times. For 400-488, it's another 10 times. Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the 8's:**\n1. **Units Place:** Similar to 4's, 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place:** In every 100 pages, 10 times. Plus 9 times in 480-488. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
