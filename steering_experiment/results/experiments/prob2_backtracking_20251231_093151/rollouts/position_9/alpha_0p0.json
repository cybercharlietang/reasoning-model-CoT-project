    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and an extra 8 numbers. In each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in 484. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last block would be 440-449, right? Let me check. 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's one full block. How many such blocks are there? From 40-49: that's one block. Then, each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears once for 10 pages. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? Let's see: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's five sets, but the first set (0-99) includes the 40-49 block, which is one. Then, each subsequent hundred has another block. So, from 0-99: 1 block. 100-199: 1 block. 200-299: 1 block. 300-399: 1 block. 400-488: 1 block. Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, but it does include 440-449, which is a full block of 10. So, in total, there are 5 blocks where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. Therefore, the number of 4's in the tens place is 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers. Therefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in the units place, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets and an extra 8 numbers. Each complete set contributes one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. Therefore, the total number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, let's count these blocks. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 is another block. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks, but the last block only has 9 numbers (480-488). Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. The last block contributes 9 numbers. So, total number of 8's in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers from 800 onwards. But since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations, especially for the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the 4's in the tens place, I considered 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50. That also seems correct. Units place: 49 fours. So, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. For the 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, 98. The difference is indeed 90. Hmm, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 fours, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4). Similarly, in 11-20, it appears once at page 14, and so on. So, I can calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages. Each complete block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial block (pages 481-488), the units digit is 1-8. So, does 481-488 include a 4 in the units place? Page 484 would have a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers every 100 pages. For example, pages 40-49 have 4 in the tens place for each page. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Each hundred has one such block. So, from 1-100, 40-49 is one block (10 numbers), 101-200, 140-149 is another, and so on. Let's calculate how many complete hundreds there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and a partial hundred (400-488). Each complete hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, the partial hundred is 400-488. In this range, the tens digit is 4 from 400-409, which is 10 pages, and then 410-419 would have 4 in the tens place again, but wait, 400-488 includes 400-488. So, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409 (10 pages) and 410-419 (another 10 pages), but wait, 410-419 is within 400-488? Wait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 400-488 includes 400-488. So, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409 (10 pages) and 410-419 (another 10 pages), but 419 is within 488, so that's 20 pages. Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 400-409 is 10, 410-419 is another 10, and 420-429 would be another 10, but 429 is beyond 488? Wait, no, 420-429 is within 488, so that's another 10, making it 30. Wait, but 400-488 is up to page 488, so after 430, 430-439 is another 10, but 439 is still less than 488. Wait, no, 439 is 439, which is less than 488, so that's another 10, making it 40. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 pages, so from 400-488, the tens digit cycles every 10. So, 400-409: 10, 410-419: 10, 420-429:10, 430-439:10, 440-449:10, but wait, 440-449 is 10 pages, but 449 is less than 488, so that's another 10. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 pages, so 400-409 is 10, 410-419 is 10, 420-429 is 10, 430-439 is 10, 440-449 is 10, and then 450-459 is 10, but 459 is still less than 488. Wait, this can't be right because 400+10*9=490, which is beyond 488. So, let me correct this. From 400-488, how many tens places have 4? The tens digit cycles every 10, so for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. But in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409 (10), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), 450-459 (10), 460-469 (10), 470-479 (10), and then 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 pages because 480 is the start, and 488 is the end. So, in the tens place, from 400-488, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 8 full blocks of 10 (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) and then in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, not 4. So, that's 8*10=80. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 pages, and 8*10=80, so 80 pages where the tens digit is 4. But wait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 80 pages with tens digit 4, and 9 pages where the tens digit is 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears 80 times in the partial hundred. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 4 (from the complete hundreds) *10=40 plus 80 from the partial hundred, so 40+80=120. Wait, that can't be right because 4 complete hundreds would each have 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40, and then the partial hundred (400-488) adds another 80, making it 120. Hmm, but wait, 400-488 is part of the 4th hundred, so maybe I'm double-counting. Wait, no, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so from 1-100: 10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, and 401-488: but wait, 400-488 is part of the 400-500 range, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and then 480-488 where the tens digit is 8. So, that's 8 blocks of 10 where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 4's, so 8*10=80. So, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 4*10 (from the first four hundreds) +80=120. Wait, but 4*10 is 40, plus 80 is 120, but that seems high. Let me check with a smaller example. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (40-49), so 10 4's. Similarly, 101-200: 10 4's in the tens place (140-149). So, for 1-400, that's 4*10=40 4's in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, which is 8 blocks of 10, so 80 4's. So, total 40+80=120 4's in the tens place. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400-488. So, how many pages is that? 488-400+1=89 pages. So, each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (120) + hundreds (89)=49+120=169, 169+89=258. So, 258 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, similar to 4's, but let's confirm. From 1-10: 8 appears once (page 8). 11-20: once at 18, etc. So, total number of 8's in the units place is the number of complete blocks of 10 in 488, which is 48, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the partial block is 481-488, which is 8 pages. In these, the units digit is 1-8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers every 100 pages. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Each hundred has one such block, so from 1-100: 80-89 (10 pages), 101-200:180-189, 201-300:280-289, 301-400:380-389, and 401-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, let's calculate:\n\nFrom 1-100: 10 8's in the tens place (80-89).\n\nFrom 101-200:10 8's (180-189).\n\nFrom 201-300:10 8's (280-289).\n\nFrom 301-400:10 8's (380-389).\n\nFrom 401-488: The tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's 9 8's.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4*10 (from the first four hundreds) +9=40+9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 1-100:10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, and 401-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the tens place for 480-488. Since 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, yes, 4*10=40 plus 9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages, except the last partial hundred where it's only 9 pages. So, 4 full hundreds contribute 40, and the partial contributes 9, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, now, the number of 4's is 258 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 258-98=160.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:120\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+120=169, 169+89=258.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:258-98=160.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 258, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 258 - 98 = 160.\n\n$\\boxed{160}$"

So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such groups are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of these 48 groups, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 times. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for ten consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). In each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, that's another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nAdding them all up: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. As before, there are 48 full groups of ten and an extra 8 pages. So, 48 * 1 = 48, and in the last group (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit is 8 for ten consecutive numbers every hundred. So, in each full hundred, that's 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 480-489, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, that's a mistake. Let me correct that. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding them all up: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14; and so on. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 complete blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, totaling 48 fours. Then, in the partial block from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, page 484 has a 4 in the units place. That adds one more 4, making the total for units place 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers. Specifically, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, and so on. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, 140-149 the second, 240-249 the third, and 340-349 the fourth. Now, 440-449 would be the fifth, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is only up to 488. So, from 440-449, that's another 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, right? Wait, 440 is less than 488, so actually, there are five blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so all five blocks are fully included. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for page numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nAdding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nUnits place: Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10, the digit 8 appears once. So, for 488 pages, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 pages (481-488). Each complete block gives one 8, so 48 eights. In the partial block, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. That's one more, making it 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers, specifically in the blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 80-89 is the first, 180-189 the second, 280-289 the third, and 380-389 the fourth. Now, 480-489 would be the fifth, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is only up to 488. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-489 would have been 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the block 480-488. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the partial block, totaling 49 eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Each complete block before 400 contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks \u00d710 = 40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up the eights from each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, in the tens place, I had 4 blocks contributing 10 each, so 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, units place is 49, tens place is 49, hundreds is 0. So, total eights are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when counting fours, I had 188 fours, and eights are 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the eights. Units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the last block, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in units place, so that's one more, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. Up to 488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 eights in tens place.\n- 180-189: another 10.\n- 280-289: another 10.\n- 380-389: another 10.\n- Then, 480-488: since the book ends at 488, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, units place is 49, tens place is 49, hundreds place is 0. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, fours: units place was 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89, totaling 188.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours minus 98 eights, which is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for fours, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for fours: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in the last block, 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once (page 484), so 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me check the units place for fours again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10=484. So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 fours in units place, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10=488. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in units place, correct.\n\nTens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d710=50 fours. Correct.\n\nTens place for eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Wait, earlier I thought there were 4 complete blocks and a partial one, but actually, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, which would be the fifth block if it went up to 489. But since it stops at 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks \u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: For fours, 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For eights, hundreds place would be 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, no eights in hundreds place. So, 0 eights.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 (480 numbers) and a partial block (481-488). Each block contributes 1 '4', totaling 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 '4's, totaling 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 '4's.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and a partial block (481-488), contributing 48 + 1 = 49 '8's.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 '8's, and 9 more in 480-488, totaling 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers in 800-899, so 0 '8's.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Let's break this down. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249 is 10. 300-399: 340-349 is 10. Now, 400-488: The tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is only 10 numbers, but since our book ends at 488, we need to check if 449 is within 488. Yes, it is. So that's another 10. So, from 0-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's count: 10 (0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times. Wait, but wait a second. The last set, 400-488, does the tens digit go up to 4? Let me check: 400-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 400-409 has tens digit 0, 410-419 is 1, 420-429 is 2, 430-439 is 3, 440-449 is 4, 450-459 is 5, 460-469 is 6, 470-479 is 7, and 480-488 is 8. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that's 10. So total tens place 4's are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, we're only considering the hundreds digit, which is 4 in all these numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, each number from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. But wait, let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me think again. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct, 89. So, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In the tens place, 8 appears in every block of 100 numbers, specifically in the 80-89 range. So, from 0-99, 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. Now, 400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 10 (0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49 times.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 (correct, since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, and the last 8 numbers don't add any more 4's in units place).\n- Tens: 50 (from 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10, total 50).\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488, 89 numbers, each with 4 in hundreds place).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49 (48 from full sets, plus 1 in the last 8 numbers, 488).\n- Tens: 49 (10 each in 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 in 400-488).\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for 4's was 89, but when I subtract, it's 187 - 98 = 89. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check with smaller numbers to see if my method is correct. Let's say for a 10-page book.\n\nPages 1-10.\n\nNumber of 4's: units place: 4 appears once (page 4). Tens place: 0. Hundreds: 0. Total 4's:1.\n\nNumber of 8's: units place: 8 appears once (page 8). Tens place: 0. Hundreds: 0. Total 8's:1.\n\nDifference: 0. That's correct.\n\nAnother test: 20-page book.\n\n4's: units: 4,14 => 2. Tens: 40-49, but 20 is less than 40, so 0. Hundreds: 0. Total 4's:2.\n\n8's: units:8,18 => 2. Tens: 0. Hundreds:0. Total 8's:2.\n\nDifference:0.\n\nWait, but in 20 pages, 4's and 8's are equal. Hmm, but in our problem, 488 is higher, so maybe the difference is more.\n\nWait, another test: 50-page book.\n\n4's: units: 4,14,24,34,44 => 5. Tens:40-49:10. Hundreds:0. Total 4's:15.\n\n8's: units:8,18,28,38,48 =>5. Tens:40-49: no, 80-89 is beyond 50, so 0. So total 8's:5.\n\nDifference:15-5=10.\n\nWait, but according to my method, for 50 pages:\n\nUnits 4's: 5 (since 50/10=5). Tens 4's: 10 (40-49). So total 15.\n\nUnits 8's:5 (8,18,28,38,48). Tens 8's:0. So total 5. Difference 10. That seems correct.\n\nSo, in 50 pages, 4's are 10 more than 8's. So, my method seems to work.\n\nTherefore, applying the same method to 488 pages, the difference is 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, in the tens place, 8's: 49.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in every set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds, and then 88 extra pages. For each complete hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the extra 88 pages (from 400 to 488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 400 to 409, the tens digit is 0, but from 410 to 419, it's 1, and so on up to 480-488. Wait, actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, 4 appears in the tens place in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, that's an additional 10. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all 89 of these numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them all up: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, in every set of ten, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In every set of 100, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, in the extra 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488), but wait, actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, 9 occurrences. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding them up: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's in the tens place, I thought that in the 400-488 range, 440-449 would have 10 fours. That's correct. So, 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 = 50. For the 8's in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, that's correct. So, 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nWait, but another thought: When calculating the units place for 8's, I considered 481-488, which includes 488, so that's correct, adding 1 more. So, units place for 8's is 49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, 8's: 98. The difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** In every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete sets of 10 (480 numbers) and an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n- **Tens place:** In every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times. There are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 40, plus 10 in 440-449, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** In every 100, 8 appears 10 times, plus 9 times in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: In every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's page 4; from 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, I can calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages and then see how many 4's are in the units place. \n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: In every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. So, I can calculate how many complete blocks of 100 there are and then add the extra if there's an incomplete block.\n\nFor the hundreds place: Since 488 is less than 500, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here because from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place. The total number of pages is 488, so the number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). So, each block contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, from 1 to 480, that's 48 blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48 4's. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so there's another 4 in 484. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks (each contributing one 4 in the units place) and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, from 1-480, it's 48 4's, and from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place. In each block of 100, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each. So, for each 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers from 401-488. So, in each of the first four blocks, there are 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0-8 in the 400s. So, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is actually 88 numbers, but the tens digit in the 400s goes up to 8, so the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 4's in the tens place in the last partial block. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nSo, total 4's: hundreds place (89) + tens place (50) + units place (49) = 89 + 50 = 139 + 49 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, 89 in hundreds place, 50 in tens, 49 in units. 89+50 is 139, plus 49 is 188. Hmm, but let me think again. Maybe I overcounted.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each block of 100 has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 40. Then, in the 400s, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10. So, 40+10=50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, from 1-480, every 10 numbers contribute one 4, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, only 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more, totaling 49. So, 49 units place 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 89 + 50 + 49 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, when does the hundreds digit equal 8? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nNow, the tens place: In each block of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in the first four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the last partial block, 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? So, that's 9 8's in the tens place in the last partial block.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 (from first four blocks) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49.\n\nNow, the units place: In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 488 is the only one with an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1-480, that's 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 488 is the only one with an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: hundreds place (0) + tens place (49) + units place (49) = 0 + 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right because when I calculated 4's, I got 188, and 8's as 98, so the difference would be 90. But let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the 8's in the tens place. Let me recount.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- From 1-100: 80-89, so 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- From 101-200: 180-189, another 10.\n- From 201-300: 280-289, another 10.\n- From 301-400: 380-389, another 10.\n- From 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nIn the units place:\n\n- From 1-480: 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48.\n- From 481-488: 488 is the only one with an 8 in the units place, so 1.\n- Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 49 (tens) + 49 (units) = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check if I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, in the 4's count:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n- Tens place: Each block of 100 has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n- Units place: From 1-480, 48 4's. From 481-488, 484 is one more, so 49.\n- Total 4's: 89 + 50 + 49 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since we don't reach 800.\n- Tens place: 4 blocks *10 = 40, plus 480-488 (9 numbers), so 49.\n- Units place: 48 from 1-480, plus 1 from 488, so 49.\n- Total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the 4's in the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 10 4's in the tens place in that last block.\n\nWait, but let me check if 488 is included. 488 is page 488, which is in the 401-488 range, so yes, included.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the units place for 4's, I included 484, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the units place, 488 is included, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's.\n\nWait, but 488 - 400 + 1 = 89, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 4's in the tens place again. Each block of 100 has 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks (1-400) contribute 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10, making 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 1-400, each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place, making 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, from 1-480, 48 8's, and from 481-488, only 488 has an 8 in the units place, so 1, totaling 49.\n\nSo, yes, 49 in units place for 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's:98. So, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a large difference, but given that the hundreds place contributes 89 4's, which is a lot, maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each 10 numbers, one 4. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, check if the last partial ten has a 4 in the units place. The last number is 488, so the units digits go from 1-8 in the last ten (481-488). So, 484 is the only one with a 4, so that's one more. So, 48 +1=49.\n\n- Tens place: For each 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100, 10 4's in the tens place. So, 488 /100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each contributes 10 4's, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more. So, total tens place 4's:40+10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, each 10 numbers contribute one 8. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), units digits go from 1-8, so 488 is the only one with an 8 in the units place, so 1 more. So, total units place 8's:48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: Each 100 numbers contribute 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-8. So, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 more. So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: As before, 0, since we don't reach 800.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm going to double-check because sometimes when counting digit positions, it's easy to miscount.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the units place: 48 full tens (1-480) give 48 4's, and 484 in the last 8 numbers (481-488) gives one more, so 49. That's correct.\n\nFor the 4's in the tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 40, and 440-449 in the last 88 numbers give 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor the 4's in the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the units place: 48 full tens (1-480) give 48, and 488 in the last 8 numbers gives one more, so 49. Correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place: 4 full hundreds give 40, and 480-488 in the last 88 numbers gives 9, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 188 4's and 98 8's, so the difference is 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - Pages 400 to 488 have '4' in the hundreds place.\n     - Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - Count of '4's: 89.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - In each block of 100 pages, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n     - There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - In the last block (401-488), '4' appears in 440-449, adding 10 more.\n     - Total count in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - In every 10 consecutive pages, '4' appears once in the units place.\n     - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48.\n     - In the last 8 pages (481-488), '4' appears once (484).\n     - Total count in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - No page numbers reach 800, so no '8's in the hundreds place.\n     - Count: 0.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - In each block of 100 pages, '8' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n     - Four complete blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - In the last block (401-488), '8' appears in 480-488, adding 9.\n     - Total count in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - In every 10 consecutive pages, '8' appears once in the units place.\n     - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48.\n     - In the last 8 pages (481-488), '8' appears once (488).\n     - Total count in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 0 (hundreds) + 49 (tens) + 49 (units) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. That's 49 times because starting from 4, each 10 numbers adds one, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since 484 is the last one before 488, that's 49 times. Wait, no, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 full cycles (1-480) which gives 48 times, and then in 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once more at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, and then 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4. From 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is one block (10 numbers), 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9). So, for each full hundred, we have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1-400, there are 4 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 440-449, that's another 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is part of the 400-499 range, so that's another 10. So up to 449, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Then, from 450-488, the next block would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 4 appears 50 (from 1-449) plus 9 (from 480-488) = 59 times? Wait, no, that's not right because I think I'm double-counting. Let me correct this. The tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, and 480-488. Each of the first five blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8, not 4. Wait, no, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so actually, the tens digit 4 doesn't appear there. Wait, that's a mistake. So, the tens digit 4 only appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. So, the tens place 4's total is 50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, so 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, for every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's 49 times. Wait, no, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 appears at 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, (n-1)*10 \u2264 480, so n-1 \u2264 48, so n \u2264 49. So, 49 times. So, units place 8's: 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have miscounted.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the range 1-488, how many full sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 full sets and then 8 extra pages. In each full set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Now, for the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. The digit 4 appears once here as well (484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, how many full hundreds do we have in 488? It's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so it's 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. That's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, 401-409: the tens digit is 0, so no 4's. Then 410-419: tens digit is 1, no. 420-429: tens digit 2, no. 430-439: tens digit 3, no. 440-449: tens digit 4, so that's 10 times. Then 450-459: 5, no. 460-469: 6, no. 470-479: 7, no. 480-488: 8, no. So, in the last 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place. Similar to 4's, in every set of ten, the digit 8 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full sets, and 8 extra pages. So, 48 times in the units place. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. The digit 8 appears once here (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place. In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. We have 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 401-409: tens digit 0, no. 410-419: 1, no. 420-429: 2, no. 430-439: 3, no. 440-449: 4, no. 450-459: 5, no. 460-469: 6, no. 470-479: 7, no. 480-488: tens digit 8, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 in all these, but wait, actually, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of ten (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the remaining 8 pages = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (4 \u00d7 10) + 10 in the last 88 pages = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times (400-488).\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of ten (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the remaining 8 pages = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 in the last 88 pages = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, how many such numbers are there? Since the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete cycles of 10 and a partial cycle of 8 numbers. But wait, in each complete cycle, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial cycle from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such sets are there? From 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, actually, since we're dealing with three-digit numbers starting from 100, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). So, for the tens place, 4 appears in each hundred block. Let me calculate how many times. \n\nFrom 1-99: The tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 times. \n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit 4 appears in 140-149, another 10 times. \n\nSimilarly, from 200-299: 240-249, 10 times. \n\nFrom 300-399: 340-349, 10 times. \n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. \n\nSo, adding these up: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times. \n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in every 10 numbers, the units digit 8 appears once. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete cycles, each contributing 1, and then in the partial cycle (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit 8 is in the tens place for all of them. Let me check: 480 has 8 in tens place, 481 has 8, ..., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, how many sets of 10 are there? \n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89, 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 8's were 49, and tens place 8's are 49 as well. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, no, in the units place, we had 49 8's. Now, in the tens place, it's 49. So, that's 49 + 49 so far.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 8's were 49, which seems correct because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles (48*1=48) and then 488 has an 8 in units place, so 48+1=49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 188 and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me check if I made a mistake in counting the 4's or 8's.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's. Units place: 48 full cycles (1-480) gives 48 4's in units. Then, from 481-488, the units digit 4 appears at 484, so that's 1 more, total 49.\n\nTens place: From 1-99: 40-49, 10 numbers.\n\n100-199: 140-149, 10.\n\n200-299: 240-249, 10.\n\n300-399: 340-349, 10.\n\n400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, since 440 to 449 is within 400-488. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full cycles (1-480) gives 48 8's. Then, 488 has an 8, so 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me confirm: from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4's, from 400-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small program or use another method to verify, but since I can't do that, I'll try to recount.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit place separately.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full decades (1-480) plus one more (484) = 49.\n\n- Tens: Each hundred has a decade with 4 in tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 hundreds (0-4), but wait, from 0-99 is considered as hundreds digit 0. So, 0-99: 40-49 (10), 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), 400-488: 440-449 (10). So, 5 sets of 10, so 50.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers.\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full decades (1-480) plus 488, so 49.\n\n- Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers. In each full block, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (on page 484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49 in each block. So, from 1-488, how many times does this happen? Let's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks of 100 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each full block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times. Wait, but 488 is less than 449? No, 488 is higher than 449, so actually, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, adding that to the 40, we get 40 + 10 = 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, which is 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, for every block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1-488, that's 48 full blocks and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times from the full blocks. In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (on page 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every block of 100, specifically from 80-89 in each block. So, from 1-488, how many times does this happen? 4 full blocks of 100, each contributing 10 times, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). So, 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full decades (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times in each block of 100 (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full blocks (1-400) contributing 40 times, and in 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 times. Total: 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. Similar to 4's, it appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times in each block of 100. There are 4 full blocks contributing 40 times, and in 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 times. Total: 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

How many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and a partial block from 481 to 488. In each of the 48 full blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once here as well (484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each set of 10. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). How many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488. Each full block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40. Now, the partial block (401-488): The tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). The 4's in the tens place would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: In the range 1-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, each block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. Up to 488, there are 48 full blocks and a partial block. So, 48*1 = 48, plus in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10 = 40. Now, the partial block 401-488: The tens digit goes up to 8 (480-488). So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but only 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. Wait, actually, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. Up to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-480) contributing 48 fours, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. Four full centuries (1-400) contribute 40 fours, plus 10 in 440-449, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers for four centuries (40) plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole groups, that's 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see, the first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block gives 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 count? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them all up: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, that's 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, adding another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check. Each block is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, starting from 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 5 blocks, but the last one has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 8 in tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, yes, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: Units (49) + Tens (49) = 98. So, total 8's are 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the tens place. For the tens digit being 8, the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, so 10 8's each, and the last one contributes 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 fours. The last partial group (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 fours. Total: 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   \nAdding these: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, 48 complete groups contribute 48 eights. The last partial group (481-488) includes 488, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 5 blocks, but the last (480-488) has 9 numbers. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last contributes 9. Total: 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nAdding these: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98 eights**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

But wait, I should check if the last partial set (481-488) has a 4 in the units place. Looking at 484, which is within this range, so that's an extra 4. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes ten 4's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks. Each contributes ten 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours.\n\nNow, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each place.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in every block of ten, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, that's 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. The last partial block is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's another 8 in the units place.

How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Wait, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 includes 480-488, which is nine numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's another 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, so I think I missed that. So, total tens place 8's would be 4 blocks of ten (40) plus one more block from 480-488, which is 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The blocks are 80-89 (10 eights), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. For the 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4); in 11-20, it appears once (at 14), and so on. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and a partial set of 8 pages (481-488). Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial set from 481-488, I need to check if there's a 4 in the units place. Looking at 484, that's a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each set of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many complete sets of 100 are in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial set from 401-488. Each complete set contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial set 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, but wait, 440 is beyond 488? Wait, no, 440 is less than 488. Wait, 401-488 is 88 pages. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. From 400-488, the tens digit cycles as 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), 3 (430-439), 4 (440-449), 5 (450-459), 6 (460-469), 7 (470-479), 8 (480-488). Each of these is 10 pages except the last one, which is 9 pages (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, in the partial set, that's another 10. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from complete sets) + 10 (from partial set) = 50.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The partial set starts at 401, so the tens digit starts at 0 for 401-410, then 1 for 411-420, etc. So, 440-449 would be within 401-488. So yes, that's 10 more. So, 50 in total.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, each page number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, the number of times 4 appears in the hundreds place is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's 89.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is the sum of 4's in units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in each set of 10, 8 appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and a partial set of 8 pages. So, 48 * 1 = 48. Then, in the partial set 481-488, the units digits are 1-8. So, 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In each set of 100, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, how many complete sets of 100 are there? 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the partial set 401-488: the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., 8 for 481-490, but since we stop at 488, it's 481-488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages (481-488). Wait, but in the tens place, it's 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but wait, in the partial set 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, 480 is included in 401-488, right? 480 is within 401-488. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 times, not 8. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, but 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages. The hundreds digit goes up to 4 (for 400-488), so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place count. For the partial set 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, yes, 9 times. So, 40 (from complete sets) + 9 = 49 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49, tens place 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each 10 numbers, 8 appears once, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times, plus in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in the tens place were 49, but let me make sure. The complete sets of 100 contribute 4 * 10 = 40. Then, the partial set 401-488 contributes 9 (from 480-488). So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the partial set 481-488, units digit 4 appears at 484. So, 1 more, total 49.\n\nTens place: 4 complete sets of 100, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the partial set 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more, total 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets, 48, plus 1 in the partial set (488), total 49.\n\nTens place: 4 complete sets, 40, plus 9 in the partial set (480-488), total 49.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears is calculated by considering each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Similarly, the number of times the digit 8 appears is counted. \n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14; and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll consider 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then check the remaining 8 pages (481-488) for any additional 4's. Wait, no, actually, 488 is the last page, so maybe it's better to calculate it as 488 // 10 = 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then the last partial block from 481-488. But actually, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the last block is 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, in the units place, each of the 48 full tens contributes one 4, so that's 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear here? Yes, at 484. So that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, and then the remaining 8 pages (481-488). The units digits in this partial block are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once here, making it 49 in total for units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: Now, for the tens digit, every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, in 0-99, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in 0-99, then another 10 times in 100-199, and so on. But since our book goes up to 488, we need to check how many full hundreds we have and the partial one. \n\nFirst, let's see how many hundreds are there. 488 is less than 500, so we have four full hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, actually, 0-99 is the first hundred, then each subsequent hundred is 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's five blocks, but the last one is only up to 488, not 499. \n\nSo, for each full hundred (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So that's 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Let's see: from 400-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, it's 1; 420-429, 2; 430-439, 3; 440-449, 4; 450-459,5; 460-469,6; 470-479,7; 480-488,8. So, in 440-449, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers, but since our book ends at 488, we have all 10 pages from 440-449. So, that's another 10 times. Therefore, total tens place 4's: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on: 400-488 is the fifth block, but the tens digit in 400-488: from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is only 9 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit 8 appears only 9 times in 480-488. But for the tens digit 4, in 440-449, that's 10 full pages, so that's 10 times. So, yes, the tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me make sure: in 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, but each digit from 0-8 appears exactly 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because the last page is 488. So, for the tens digit 4, it's 10 times in 440-449, so that's correct. So, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages from 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these pages has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many full tens are there in 488? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, where the units digits are 1-8. So, 8 appears once here, at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place: For the tens digit, in each full hundred, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, how many full hundreds do we have? 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. So, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40. Now, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, and that's 9 pages (480-488). So, that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, 40 (from first four hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full tens + 1 in 481-488 = 49\n- Tens: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in 440-449 = 50\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full tens + 1 in 481-488 = 49\n- Tens: 4 hundreds *10 =40, plus 9 in 480-488 =49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 +49=98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit position (units, tens, hundreds). \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one '4'.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (480 numbers) contributing 48 '4's.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one more '4' (at 484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's in the tens place.\n   - There are four full hundreds (1-399), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 '4's.\n   - The block 400-488 contributes another 10 '4's (440-449).\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The numbers 400-488 each have a '4' in the hundreds place, totaling 89 '4's.\n\nAdding these, the total number of '4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nFor the digit '8':\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to '4', there are 48 full blocks contributing 48 '8's.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers include one '8' (at 488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each full hundred contributes 10 '8's, totaling 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The block 400-488 contributes 9 '8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, the units digit 4 is in 4; from 11-20, it's in 14, and so on. So, to find how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of ten, and then check the remaining 8 numbers. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, for the remaining numbers from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, in this partial group, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire set of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, there's one set (40-49), in 101-200, another set (140-149), and so on. Let me calculate how many hundreds are there. Since 488 is less than 500, we have 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 more pages. So, in each hundred, there's one set of ten where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 occurrences. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 occurrences. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every set of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include the number 488, so the units digit 8 appears once more. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire set of ten numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Let's see. Each hundred has one set of ten where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). Each contributes 10 occurrences, so that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is actually 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them except 488, where the units digit is 8. Wait, no, 480 is 480, 481, ..., up to 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting for the tens place of 8's. In the last 88 pages, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That adds up.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place.  \n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing 1, totaling 48.  \n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one more 4 (484).  \n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every 100 numbers have a group (e.g., 40-49) where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 each.  \n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 full hundreds, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) include another 10 (440-449).  \n   - Total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.  \n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers contribute one 8.  \n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full groups, totaling 48.  \n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one more 8 (488).  \n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every 100 numbers have a group (e.g., 80-89) contributing 10 each.  \n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 full hundreds, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - Remaining 88 numbers (401-488) include 9 more (480-488).  \n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.  \n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, pages 4, 14, 24, etc. Now, I need to figure out how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages. Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 pages. In each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial set from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does the digit 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at page 484. So that's one more 4.

For example, pages 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block has 10 pages, so that's 5 x 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. But wait, let me check: from 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Yes, that's five blocks. So 5 x 10 = 50. \n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488. But let me think: the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, which means 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I should check if 400 is included. Yes, because the first page is 1, so 400 is included. So, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, every 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 x 1 = 48. Then, in the partial set from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once at page 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages every 100 pages. So, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 pages. So, how many full blocks are there? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 pages\n- 180-189: 10 pages\n- 280-289: 10 pages\n- 380-389: 10 pages\n- 480-488: 9 pages\n\nSo, that's four full blocks of 10 pages each, contributing 10 8's each, and one partial block of 9 pages, contributing 9 8's. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 pages, so 10 8's in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189 is another 10, and so on. But wait, 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899. But since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For 480-488, the tens digit is 8, right? So, pages 480 to 488: that's 9 pages, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 4 is at 484, so that's one more, making 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 4's, so 5 x 10 = 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete sets, 48 8's, plus 488, which is one more, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For the hundreds place, the digit is 4 from 400 to 499, but since we only go up to 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's, since the book ends at 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 consecutive numbers contribute one '4' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 480, contributing 48 '4's.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one '4' (at 484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 '4's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers have a block of 10 where the tens digit is '4' (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 5 such blocks in 488 pages (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 '4's.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 '4's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '4' from page 400 to 488.\n   - This range includes 89 pages.\n   - Total: 89 '4's.\n\n**Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to '4's, every 10 numbers contribute one '8'.\n   - 48 complete sets contribute 48 '8's.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one '8' (at 488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers have a block of 10 where the tens digit is '8' (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 '8's.\n   - The partial block 480-488 contributes 9 '8's.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 '8's.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of '4's minus number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll consider 48 full blocks (up to page 480) and then the remaining 8 pages (481-488). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. The digit 4 appears once here (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in each block of 100. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). In each of the 4 full hundreds, there's one block where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 4's each. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place from 401-410, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 4's here.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in every block of 10, the digit 8 appears once. So, 48 full blocks (1-480) give 48 8's. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in each block of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? There are 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). In each full hundred, there's one block with 8 in the tens place, contributing 10 8's each. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488, but 480 is 480, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but actually, 480 is the first, so 480-489 would be 10, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place here. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's in the tens place, I had 4 full hundreds giving 40, and then 401-488 giving 10, totaling 50. That seems right. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full hundreds giving 40, and then 401-488 giving 9, totaling 49. Hmm, but wait, in the units place, both 4 and 8 had 49 each. But in the tens place, 4 had 50 and 8 had 49. So, the total 4's are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. The 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and 8 remaining numbers (481-488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n- **Tens place:** In every block of 100 numbers, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full blocks (1-400) and one partial block (401-488), where 401-410 adds another 10. So, 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, 4 appears 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n- **Tens place:** In every block of 100, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers. There are 4 full blocks and a partial block (401-488) where 480-488 adds 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10 and take the integer part. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, does the last group (481-488) have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is within this range, so that's correct.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block has ten 4's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: the first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers, contributing ten 4's. The next block would be 140-149, another ten 4's. Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349. The next would be 440-449. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another ten. Let me count how many blocks that is. From 40-49: 1 block, 140-149: 2nd, 240-249: 3rd, 340-349: 4th, 440-449: 5th. So that's five blocks, each contributing ten 4's, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds place is only for three-digit numbers, so from 100 to 999. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the 4 in the hundreds place is from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers as I calculated. So, 89 times.\n\nAdding up the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: Similar to the 4's, every group of ten numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, does the last group (481-488) have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is the last page, so that's an 8 in the units place. So, 48 times.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, let's see how many full blocks we have. \n\nFrom 80-89: 10 numbers, ten 8's in the tens place.\n180-189: another ten.\n280-289: another ten.\n380-389: another ten.\n480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's nine 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of ten (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, plus the last partial block 480-488 contributing 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check again. The first four blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each giving ten 8's, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so nine 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero times.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units place (48) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units and tens places. For units place, we have 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. But does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with an 8, so that's included in the 48, right? Because 488 is the 48th group (since 48 \u00d7 10 = 480, so the 48th group is 480-489, but we only go up to 488). So, in the units place, every ten numbers contribute one 8, so 48 times.\n\nIn the tens place, as I calculated, 49 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. So, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nFor the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times.\n- Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each block is ten numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times.\n- Tens place: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 480-488 contributing 9, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (including 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place: 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similarly, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks contributing 40, and the partial block 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets and then 8 more numbers. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, units place gives me 48 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block gives 10 fours, so 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. \n\nSo, total number of 4's is 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 fours.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach.\n\nStarting with the units place: Just like with 4's, in each set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of ten, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once here (at 488). So, units place gives 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each giving 10 eights, so 4*10 = 40 eights. \n\nWait, but wait, the next block would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, which are 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks contributing 10 each, which is 40, plus 9 more from 480-488. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Each block of ten where the tens digit is 8 contributes 10 eights. So, 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. So that's 4 blocks, 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 more eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last partial set (481-488), units digit 8 appears once at 488, so total units eights: 48 +1=49. Tens place: blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10, so 4*10=40, plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place, so 40+9=49. So, total 8's: 49 +49=98. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm counting correctly in the tens place. For example, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for all those numbers, right? 480 has 8 in tens, 481 has 8, up to 488. So that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, that's 9.\n\nNow, let me check the 4's again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Units place: 48 fours. Tens place: 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Hundreds place: 89 fours from 400-488. So, 48+50+89=187 fours. That seems correct.\n\nNow, number of 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98 eights.\n\nSo, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. So 89 fours there.\n\nFor the tens place, 4's: The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 fours, correct.\n\nSo 48+50+89=187 fours.\n\nFor 8's: Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So 49 units eights.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So 49 tens eights.\n\nSo total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo difference:187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 488 is counted once.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** For every 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '4's. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any '4's in the units place.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in the tens place for the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 '4's, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 '4's.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, every number has a '4' in the hundreds place, contributing 89 '4's.\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 '4's.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** For every 10 numbers, '8' appears once. There are 48 complete sets, contributing 48 '8's. The number 488 adds one more '8' in the units place, totaling 49 '8's.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in the tens place for 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 '8's (40 in total). Additionally, 480-488 contributes 9 '8's in the tens place.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 '8's.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of '8's from the number of '4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 89 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 complete groups, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so no 4 there. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, every 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). In each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, 4 hundreds x 10 = 40 times. Now, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the tens place. Wait, actually, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Let's see: 440-449 would be the only set where the tens digit is 4. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on. 401-488 is actually 88 numbers, but the tens digit cycles every 10. So, from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; ... up to 480-488, tens digit is 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, yes, 50 total 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, let me check: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, in each group of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 48 complete groups (as before), each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, the extra 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once more in 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: In each complete hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4 x 10 = 40 times. Now, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers. So, that's 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, correct. So, yes, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's appeared 187 times, and 8's appeared 98 times. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8 again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more in 488. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 8: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 4 hundreds x 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nAnd hundreds place for 8: 0, since we don't reach 800. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 187; 8's: 98. Difference: 89.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (48 groups of 10).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40 from complete hundreds, 10 from 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 groups of 10 plus 1 in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (40 from complete hundreds plus 9 from 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the incomplete set from 481-488, there's a 4 in 484, so that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes ten 4's in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), there's one block of ten where the tens digit is 4. So, 488 is less than 500, so there are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is in the 400s, so the blocks are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, that's five blocks. But wait, each block up to 400 would have a full set of ten 4's in the tens place. Let me check: 40-49 in 1-100, 140-149 in 101-200, 240-249 in 201-300, 340-349 in 301-400. That's four blocks, each contributing ten 4's, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last block, 401-488, how many 4's in the tens place? Well, 401-488 includes 401-410, 411-420, ..., up to 481-488. The tens digit is 0 in 401-410, then 1 in 411-420, and so on up to 8 in 481-488. Wait, no, the tens digit in 401-488 is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, 2 in 421-430, 3 in 431-440, 4 in 441-450, 5 in 451-460, 6 in 461-470, 7 in 471-480, and 8 in 481-488. But we're looking for the tens digit being 4, so that's the block 441-450. That's ten numbers, so ten 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, because in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 4 only in 441-450, which is ten numbers, so ten 4's. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 = 50. Wait, but 4*10 is 40, plus 10 is 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my math again. Wait, units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, yes. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Units and tens: 49 + 50 = 99. So total 4's: 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds as well.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, every ten numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 8, so 48. Plus, in the incomplete set 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten numbers in each block of 100, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. Each hundred has one such block, so from 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, there's a block of ten where the tens digit is 8, contributing ten 8's each. So, 4 blocks * 10 = 40. Now, in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is nine numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is nine numbers if you count 480 as the first. Wait, 480, 481, ..., 488 is nine numbers, right? Wait, 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 in nine numbers in the last block. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because 188 - 98 seems like a big difference. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's or 8's.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: For every 10 numbers, one 4. 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, units place: 48 +1 =49. That seems correct.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundred, there's a block of ten where the tens digit is 4. So, 1-100: 40-49 (10 4's), 101-200:140-149 (10), 201-300:240-249 (10), 301-400:340-349 (10). That's four blocks, 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is ten numbers, so ten more 4's. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50. That's correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. So, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 8 is in 488, so one more, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has a block of ten with tens digit 8. So, 1-100:80-89 (10), 101-200:180-189 (10), 201-300:280-289 (10), 301-400:380-389 (10). That's four blocks, 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is nine numbers (480-488), so nine 8's. So, total tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: No 8's, as the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 +49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe the counts were off. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit is >=4, add 1 if 488 mod 10 >=4. 488 mod10=8, which is >=4, so units 4's:48+1=49.\n\nFor 8's: same logic, floor(488/10)=48, plus if last digit >=8, add 1 if 488 mod10 >=8. 488 mod10=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: floor(488/100)=4 (since 488/100=4.88), so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, check the remaining 88 numbers (488 - 4*100=88). The tens digit cycles every 100, so in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. So, total tens 4's:40+10=50.\n\nFor 8's: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last 88 numbers, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 more 8's. So, total tens 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since 488 is less than 1000, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nFor 8's: hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but 488 is less than 800, so no 8's in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - In the incomplete set (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - For every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49).\n   - Total complete sets of 100 in 488 pages: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n   - Each set contributes 10 4's, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In the last partial set (401-488), 440-449 contributes another 10 4's.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8.\n   - Total complete sets of 10: 48.\n   - In the incomplete set (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - For every 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers.\n   - Total complete sets of 100: 4.\n   - Each set contributes 10 8's, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In the last partial set (401-488), 480-488 contributes 9 8's.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - There are no page numbers from 800-899, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4); from 11-20, it appears once (page 14), and so on. So, I need to figure out how many complete sets of ten there are in 488 pages and then account for any remaining numbers. \n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: In every set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers. For example, from 40-49, each page number has a 4 in the tens place. So, in each hundred, there are 10 instances of 4 in the tens place. \n\nFor the hundreds place: Since the book has up to 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). \n\nWait, but actually, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 instances of 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nNow, let's calculate the number of 4's in each position. \n\nFirst, units place: How many complete tens are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of ten and 8 extra numbers. In each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), we check if any have a 4 in the units place. 484 is the only one, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nNext, tens place: As I thought earlier, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, there are 10 instances where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? The hundreds digit goes from 0 (for pages 1-99) to 4 (for pages 400-488). So, there are 5 hundreds (0,1,2,3,4). Wait, no, actually, pages 1-99 are in the 0 hundreds, then 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set (400-488) isn't a full hundred. \n\nSo, for each full hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), there are 10 instances of 4 in the tens place. That's 3 sets \u00d7 10 = 30. Now, for the last set, 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? That's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is less than 499, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 30 + 10 = 40. \n\nWait, no, hold on. From 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the 4 in the tens place occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more. So, total tens place 4's: 3\u00d710 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40. \n\nNow, hundreds place: As I thought earlier, from 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, hundreds place 4's: 89. \n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178. Wait, 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178. So, 178 4's in total. \n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. \n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, in each set of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, total number of units place 8's is the number of complete tens in 488 plus any remaining in the last partial set. \n\n488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), how many have 8 in the units place? That's 488, so one more. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, there are 10 instances where the tens digit is 8. Now, how many full hundreds are there? As before, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, 4 full hundreds? Wait, no, 0-99 is the first hundred, then 100-199, etc. So, up to 488, we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, five sets, but the last one is incomplete. \n\nSo, for each full hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), there are 10 instances of 8 in the tens place, so 3\u00d710=30. Now, for the last set, 400-488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? That's from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 instances. So, total tens place 8's: 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nWait, let me check that. From 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the 8 in the tens place occurs from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 instances. So, total tens place 8's: 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39. \n\nHundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (39) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 39 = 88. \n\nWait, that seems off because earlier I thought units place 8's were 49, tens place 39, so total 88. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check the tens place. For each full hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), there are 10 8's in the tens place. So, 3\u00d710=30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, as I thought. So, 30 + 9=39. So, that's correct. \n\nNow, units place: 48 complete tens, each with one 8, so 48, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), only 488 has an 8 in the units place, so 1 more, totaling 49. \n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 39 (tens) = 88. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 48 times for the complete sets, and then in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once, making it 49. That's correct. \n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, each hundred has 10 instances, so 3\u00d710=30, and in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, totaling 39. \n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 39 = 88. \n\nNow, the number of 4's was 178, and the number of 8's is 88. So, the difference is 178 - 88 = 90. \n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. \n\nNumber of 4's: \n\n- Units place: 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place, so 1 more. Total: 49. \n\n- Tens place: In each full hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), 10 each, so 3\u00d710=30. In 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. Total: 30 + 10 = 40. \n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. \n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178. \n\nNumber of 8's: \n\n- Units place: 48 complete tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. In the last 8 numbers (481-488), 488 has an 8, so 1 more. Total: 49. \n\n- Tens place: In each full hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), 10 each, so 3\u00d710=30. In 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. Total: 30 + 9 = 39. \n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since the book doesn't reach 800. \n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 39 = 88. \n\nSo, difference: 178 - 88 = 90. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I feel like 90 might be too high. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different approach to verify. \n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears in a range is to consider each digit position separately and calculate the contributions.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is given by:\n\nfloor(n / 10) * 1 + (1 if the units digit of n is >= d else 0)\n\nBut wait, that's only for digits from 0-9, but since we're starting from 1, maybe it's slightly different. Let me adjust.\n\nWait, no, actually, for each digit position, the count can be calculated as follows.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place from 1 to n:\n\nLet q = floor(n / 10)\nLet r = n % 10\n\nIf d == 0, then it's q - 1 (since 0 doesn't appear in the units place for numbers 1-9)\nElse, it's q + (1 if r >= d else 0)\n\nWait, but since we're starting from 1, for d=0, it's a bit different. But since we're looking for digits 4 and 8, which are non-zero, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place = floor(n / 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nSo, for d=4, n=488:\n\nfloor(488 / 10) = 48\n488 % 10 = 8\nSince 8 >= 4, add 1\nSo, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nfloor(488 / 10) = 48\n488 % 10 = 8\nSince 8 >= 8, add 1\nSo, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier count.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nThe formula is a bit more involved. The number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is calculated as:\n\nLet higher = floor(n / 100)\nLet current = floor((n / 10) % 10)\nLet lower = n % 10\n\nIf current > d: count = (higher + 1) * 10\nIf current == d: count = higher * 10 + lower + 1\nIf current < d: count = higher * 10\n\nBut we have to adjust for d=0, which is a bit different because leading zeros aren't counted.\n\nBut since we're dealing with d=4 and d=8, which are non-zero, we can apply the formula as is.\n\nLet's apply it for d=4 in the tens place:\n\nn=488\n\nhigher = floor(488 / 100) = 4\ncurrent = floor((488 / 10) % 10) = floor(48.8 % 10) = 8\nlower = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSince current (8) > d (4), count = (higher + 1) * 10 = (4 + 1) * 10 = 50\n\nWait, but earlier I counted 40 for the tens place 4's. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the formula for the tens place is:\n\nIf the current digit (tens place) is greater than d, then the count is (higher + 1) * 10.\n\nIf it's equal, then it's higher * 10 + lower + 1.\n\nIf it's less, then higher * 10.\n\nSo, for d=4 in tens place:\n\nhigher = 4 (from 488 / 100)\ncurrent = 8 (from (488 /10) %10 = 48 %10 =8)\nlower =8\n\nSince current (8) > d (4), count = (4 +1)*10 =50\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 40. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's think differently. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.) contributes 10 instances where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, 10. From 300-399: 340-349, 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. But wait, from 400-488, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total 5\u00d710=50. But earlier, I thought it was 40. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier when I said that in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times, but actually, in the hundreds blocks before 400, each contributes 10, and the 400-488 block contributes another 10, making it 5\u00d710=50. But earlier, I thought that in the tens place, from 100-399, it's 3\u00d710=30, and from 400-488, 10, totaling 40. Wait, but that's incorrect because from 0-99, there's another 10, making it 50. So, the formula gives 50, which is correct. So, earlier, I missed the 0-99 block, which contributes another 10. So, the correct count is 50.\n\nWait, but when I first calculated, I only considered 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, which is 4 blocks, each contributing 10, making it 40. But I forgot that 0-99 is another block, which also contributes 10. So, total 50. So, the formula is correct, giving 50. Therefore, the correct count for tens place 4's is 50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in the tens place:\n\nhigher = floor(488 / 100) =4\ncurrent = floor((488 /10) %10)=8\nlower=8\n\nSince current (8) >= d (8), count = higher *10 + lower +1=4*10 +8 +1=40 +9=49\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 39. Hmm, let's see.\n\nWait, using the formula, for d=8 in the tens place:\n\nhigher=4\ncurrent=8\nlower=8\n\nSince current == d, count=higher*10 + lower +1=4*10 +8 +1=40 +9=49\n\nBut earlier, I thought that in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. And from 100-399, each contributes 10, so 3\u00d710=30, totaling 30 +9=39. But according to the formula, it's 49. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's count manually. From 0-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199:180-189, 10. From 200-299:280-289, 10. From 300-399:380-389,10. From 400-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total:10+10+10+10+9=49. So, the formula is correct, giving 49. So, earlier, I made a mistake by not including the 0-99 block, which contributes another 10. So, the correct count is 49.\n\nTherefore, correcting my earlier mistake, the number of 8's in the tens place is 49, not 39.\n\nWait, but that changes things. Let me recast all the numbers.\n\nSo, for 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89 (from 400-488)\nTotal 4's:49 +50 +89= 188\n\nWait, no, hold on. Earlier, I thought the hundreds place for 4's was 89, but actually, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nBut for 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49 +49=98\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought units place 8's were 49, tens place 49, so total 98. But that contradicts my earlier count where I thought tens place 8's were 39. So, I need to resolve this.\n\nWait, using the formula, for d=8 in the tens place, the count is 49, as per the formula, because higher=4, current=8, lower=8, so count=4*10 +8 +1=49. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of 8's in the tens place is 49.\n\nSimilarly, for d=4 in the tens place, the count is 50, as per the formula.\n\nSo, correcting my earlier mistake, the total number of 4's is:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188\n\nAnd the number of 8's is:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, but after correcting the counts, it's still 90. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, the correct counts are:\n\nNumber of 4's:188\n\nNumber of 8's:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 178 and 8's were 88, but that was due to an incorrect count in the tens place for both digits. After applying the formula correctly, the counts are 188 and 98, respectively, leading to a difference of 90.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use another method to verify. Let's try counting the number of 4's and 8's in each position again, but more carefully.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor 4's: From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, so one more. Total:49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: same logic, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers, 488 has an 8, so one more. Total:49.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nFor 4's: In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 0-99:40-49, 10 numbers. From 100-199:140-149, 10. From 200-299:240-249,10. From 300-399:340-349,10. From 400-488:440-449,10. So, that's 5 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: Similarly, from 0-99:80-89,10. From 100-199:180-189,10. From 200-299:280-289,10. From 300-399:380-389,10. From 400-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: From 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89).\n\nFor 8's: Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 full sets of ten, which would account for 48 fours in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 49th set would only go up to 488, which is 488. So, in the units place, we have 48 fours. \n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers each time, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Let's see how many such sets there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in the first hundred (1-100), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). Similarly, in the second hundred (101-200), it's 140-149, another 10. In the third hundred (201-300), it's 240-249, another 10. Now, in the fourth hundred (301-400), it's 340-349, another 10. But wait, 400-488 is the next range. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is 10 numbers, and then 410-419, but wait, 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the 400s. So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is 10 numbers, and then 410-419 would have tens digit 1, so the next set would be 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488. So, let me correct that. Actually, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's 10 in 400-449 and 10 in 440-449? Wait, no, 440-449 is part of the 400s. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. From 1-488, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? It's every 100 numbers, so 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's five sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187 fours.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48 fours, correct because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Tens place: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 89 numbers from 400-488, so 89. So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 fours.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: For every ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so the last set is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 times? Wait, 1-488, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but the 49th set would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the units place, 48 times, but wait, let's count differently. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48 times. But wait, 488 is the 48th ten, so 48 times. So, 48 eights in the units place.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers each time, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's see how many such sets there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many sets? 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm. 80-89: 10 eights in tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. That's 4 sets, 40 eights. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But since the book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97 eights.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Units place: 48 eights, correct. Tens place: 49 eights, as per above. So, total eights: 97.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 187, and the number of eights is 97. So, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 48 (from 4,14,...,484)\n- Tens: 50 (from 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449)\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488)\nTotal: 48+50+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 48 (from 8,18,...,488)\n- Tens: 49 (from 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 48+49=97. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 187 fours minus 97 eights equals 90 more fours.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. I counted 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. But from 400-488, the tens digit being 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 5 sets in total.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights, making it 49.\n\nYes, so the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think about the units place for eights. From 1-488, how many eights are there in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so does that mean the 49th set is 480-488, which has 488 as the last number. So, in the units place, 488 has an 8, so that's included in the 48th set? Wait, no, 480-488 is the 49th set, but only 9 numbers. So, the units digit 8 occurs in 480, 481, ..., 488, so that's 9 times in the units place in the 49th set. But wait, that would mean that the units place has 48 eights from 1-480, and then 9 more from 481-488, making it 57? Wait, no, that can't be right because I'm double-counting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the units place. Let me recount the units place for eights. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each block of 10, the units digit 8 appears once. So, from 1-488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include another 8 in the units place (488). So, total eights in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so that's 49 eights in the units place, not 48. That changes things. So, earlier, I thought units place had 48 eights, but actually, it's 49.\n\nSimilarly, let's check the tens place. The tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, earlier, I thought units place had 48, but it's actually 49 because 488 is included. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, now, fours are 187, eights are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, where did I go wrong earlier? I think I didn't account for the fact that 488 has an 8 in the units place, which adds an extra 8 in the units place, making it 49 instead of 48.\n\nSo, let me correct that. Units place for eights: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. Total eights: 98.\n\nSo, fours: 187, eights: 98. Difference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the units place again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total eights: 49+49=98.\n\nFours: 187.\n\nSo, difference: 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place had 48, but now it's 49. So, the correct difference is 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. For fours, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSo, total fours: 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=187.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nSo, 187-98=89.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 89 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the tens place correctly for fours? I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Let me list them:\n\n40-49:10\n140-149:10\n240-249:10\n340-349:10\n440-449:10\n\nThat's 5 sets, so 50 fours in the tens place. Correct.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 400-488:89 fours.\n\nUnits place:48 fours.\n\nSo, 48+50+89=187.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits:49\nTens:49\nHundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nSo, 187-98=89.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think my initial mistake was not considering that the units place for eights includes 488, which adds an extra 8, making it 49 instead of 48. So, the correct difference is 89.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 fours. Additionally, 484 is included, so no extra fours are added beyond the 48.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149). There are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), contributing 50 fours.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From page 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - **Total Fours:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 complete sets (including 488), contributing 49 eights.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189). There are 4 full sets contributing 40 eights, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9 eights, totaling 49 eights.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total Eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of fours: 187\n   - Number of eights: 98\n   - Difference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers. Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit is 4 in 484. So, that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in every set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, how many complete sets of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete sets. Each contributes 10 4's, so that's 4*10=40. Now, for the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in every set of ten, 8 appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of ten and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times, plus in 488, the units digit is 8 in 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 appears once more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In every set of 100, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 complete sets of 100 contribute 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 more. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 more pages. In each block, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once in 484. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every block of 100, specifically from x40 to x49, where x is the hundreds digit. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, 400-488 is part of the three-digit numbers. So, let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. \n\nFor the hundreds digit 0 (which would be 0-99), the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, that's 10 times. Similarly, for hundreds digit 1 (100-199), it's 140-149, another 10 times. Same for hundreds digits 2 and 3: 240-249 and 340-349, each contributing 10 times. Now, for hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449. That's 10 times as well. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, total tens place 4's are 10 (for 0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 50 times. But wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place only for page numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so the hundreds place has 89 occurrences of 4. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-499, but since our book ends at 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's are units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: For every block of 10, the digit 8 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48 blocks, with 8 remaining pages. So, 48 times in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every block of 100, specifically x80 to x89. So, for 0-99, it's 80-89, which is 10 times. Similarly, for 100-199, it's 180-189, another 10 times. For 200-299, 280-289, 10 times. For 300-399, 380-389, 10 times. Now, for 400-488, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place 8's are 10 (0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that last part. From 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, yes, 9 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nSo, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check again. In the tens place, for 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 8's are 49, tens place 49, so 98 total. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the units place. For units place, 488 / 10 is 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 8 only in 488, so that's one more, making 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place, in 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 10 (for each hundred block) *4 = 40, plus 9, totaling 49. So, yes, 49 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's were 98, and 4's were 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's.\n\nUnits place: 488 /10 =48, remainder 8. So, 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 in units place, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 4 only in 484, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 49.\n\nTens place: For each hundred block, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, that's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. Wait, but in the hundreds block 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 in tens place.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 +89= 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's: Units place: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 8 in 488, so one more, total 49.\n\nTens place: For each hundred block, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10 8's, and the last one contributes 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've missed anything. For example, in the hundreds place, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, which is correct because 488-400+1=89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 49 in tens place.\n\nWait, but let me think about the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full times, and then in the last partial block, 481-488, 8 appears once at 488. So, 48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the units place, same logic applies, giving 49.\n\nSo, yes, 188 4's and 98 8's, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating, but I want to make sure I didn't miss any edge cases. For example, page 800 would have an 8 in the hundreds place, but our book ends at 488, so that's not an issue. Similarly, in the hundreds place, only 4's appear, so no 8's there.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately and sum them up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor a digit d in a certain position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times it appears can be calculated by considering higher, current, and lower digits.\n\nBut since 488 is not a very large number, maybe my initial approach is sufficient.\n\nWait, but let me try applying the formula method to cross-verify.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: Let's consider the number as ABC, where A is hundreds, B is tens, C is units.\n\nFor each complete hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears 10 times per hundred. But since 488 is less than 500, we have 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488.\n\nWait, no, actually, 488 is in the 400-488 range, which is the fifth hundred block. Wait, but 0-99 is the first hundred, 100-199 second, etc., up to 400-488 being part of the fifth hundred, but not complete.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of higher digits.\n\nBut maybe it's getting too complicated. Alternatively, let's stick with my initial count.\n\nSo, I think my initial count was correct: 188 4's and 98 8's, so 90 more 4's.\n\nWait, but let me check again the count for 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nSo, 50 +49 +89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nSo, 98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full blocks, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once (484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For every block of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149).\n   - There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full blocks, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For every block of 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189).\n   - There are 4 full blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), contributing 40 occurrences.\n   - In 400-488, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4). Similarly, in 11-20, it appears once at page 14, and so on. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each complete set of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. That gives me 48 times 1, which is 48 fours. Now, I need to check the remaining 8 numbers (481-488). The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at 484. So that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. Let me figure out how many hundreds are in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and 88 extra numbers. Each complete hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, the remaining 88 numbers are from 401 to 488. Wait, no, actually, the remaining after 400 is 401-488, but I think I should consider the tens digit in 401-488. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is less than 490, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's another 10 fours in the tens place. So, total tens place fours are 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check: 400-499 would be 5 hundreds, but we only go up to 488. So, actually, from 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so that's 5*10=50 fours in the tens place up to 449. But since our book ends at 488, which is beyond 449, but in the 400s, the tens digit 4 is only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, up to 488, the tens digit 4 occurs 5 times (each hundred contributing 10, but wait, let me recount. From 1-100: 40-49: 10 fours. 101-200: 140-149: 10 fours. 201-300: 240-249: 10 fours. 301-400: 340-349: 10 fours. 401-488: 440-449: 10 fours. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours are units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188 fours.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. Units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1 four, plus 1 more in 484, totaling 49. Tens place: 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to fours, in each set of 10, the units digit is 8 once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1 eight, totaling 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers are 481-488. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total units place eights are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see:\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 4 sets of 10, each contributing 10 eights, plus 9 eights in 480-488. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block (400-488), which contributes 9 eights because we stop at 488. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, and then 480-488 contributes 9 more. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For example, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 488. So, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place here. And before that, each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds contribute 40, plus 9 makes 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total fours are 188, and eights are 98. The question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting fours:\n- Units: 48 sets of 10, each contributing 1 four, plus 1 in 484: 48 + 1 = 49.\n- Tens: 5 sets of 10 (each hundred contributing 10 fours), so 5*10=50. Wait, earlier I thought 5 sets, but actually, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, and then 440-449 in the 400s, which is another 10 fours. So, 4*10 + 10 = 50. So, that's correct.\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours.\n\nCounting eights:\n- Units: 48 sets of 10, each contributing 1 eight, plus 1 in 488: 48 +1=49.\n- Tens: 4 sets of 10 (each hundred contributing 10 eights) plus 9 in 480-488: 4*10 +9=49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nSo, 49 +49=98 eights.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about the hundreds place for fours, it's 89 numbers, which seems correct because from 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nBut let me check the units place again. For fours, in each set of 10, one four in the units place. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 four, so 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So, 48 +1=49 fours in units place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, units place: 48 sets, each contributing 1 eight, so 48, plus 1 in 488, making 49.\n\nTens place for fours: Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nTens place for eights: Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 hundreds contribute 40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, so 9 eights. Total 49.\n\nSo, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 188 fours minus 98 eights, which equals 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 188 fours and 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between the counts.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each set of 10 consecutive numbers contributes one 4 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 fours.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one more 4 (at 484).\n   - Total units place fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place.\n   - There are 5 hundred blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500), but we only go up to 488.\n   - Each of the first four hundred blocks contributes 10 fours, totaling 40.\n   - The 401-488 range includes 440-449, contributing another 10 fours.\n   - Total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - Total hundreds place fours: 89.\n\n**Total fours:**\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each set of 10 contributes one 8 in the units place.\n   - 48 complete sets contribute 48 eights.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one more 8 (at 488).\n   - Total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place.\n   - The first four hundred blocks contribute 40 eights.\n   - The range 480-488 contributes 9 eights (480-488).\n   - Total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no pages with hundreds digit 8 in a 488-page book.\n   - Total hundreds place eights: 0.\n\n**Total eights:**\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\n- Total: 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of fours: 188\n- Number of eights: 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4); from 11-20, it appears once (at page 14), and so on. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and an extra 8 pages. Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. The extra 8 pages are from 481 to 488, and within these, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 would be the only number where the units digit is 4 in this partial set. So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long, so each contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, 40-49 is one range, then 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, I should check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them all up: Units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. So total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, I need to do the same for the digit 8. Let me go through each digit position again: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in each set of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? As before, 48 complete sets, contributing 48 8's. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 488 is the only number where the units digit is 8 in this partial set. So, that's one more 8. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this range. Each of these ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) is 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 489 is beyond 488). So, that's four full ranges (each contributing 10) and one partial range contributing 9. So, total 8's in tens place: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 8's. So, yes, 4\u00d710=40 plus 9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: Units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 complete sets of 10, plus 1 in the last partial set (481-488), so 49.\n- Tens: 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 complete sets, plus 1 in the last partial set (488), so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 40, plus 9 in 480-488, total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - In every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.  \n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.  \n   - The last partial set (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.  \n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   - There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.  \n   - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.  \n   - 48 complete sets contribute 48, and the last partial set (481-488) includes 488, adding 1.  \n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   - There are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - The range 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences.  \n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).  \n   - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4). Similarly, in 11-20, it appears once at page 14, and so on. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 complete sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial set (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once at page 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, and so on. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 instances. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages: 440-449. So, that's another 10. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so from 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 440-449 is within that range, so yes, that's 10 more. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? It's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 instances of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, actually, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, but each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, in each set of 10, 8 appears once. So, 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, the partial set 481-488: the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at page 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 4 ranges would give 4 * 10 = 40 instances. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-488. The tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers: 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 488 is included. So, how many times does the tens digit 8 appear here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 more. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 instances. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 instances.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 4's were 188 and 8's were 98, so the difference would be 90. But let me double-check.\n\nWait, when counting the tens place for 8's, I think I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place, the digit 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 4 ranges * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, as before. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but in the tens place, each of these has 8 as the tens digit, so that's 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49, which is correct.\n\nSo, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, 4's are 188, 8's are 98, so the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the count for 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89. Then, units place: 49, tens place:50, so 89 + 49 = 138, plus 50 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider each digit position separately.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\n- 4's: For each 10 numbers, one 4. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once at 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- 8's: Similarly, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), 8 appears once at 488. So, total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- 8's: For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers: 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with hundreds digit 4. So, 89.\n\n- 8's: From 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's, in the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 instances. So, 40 (from the four full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90.\n\nBut wait, I just thought of something else. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to check: total number of digits used.\n\nWait, maybe not necessary, but just to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 4 appears once in the units place (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens: For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449). So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 8 appears once in the units place (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens: For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole sets, that's 48 complete sets, and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 occurrences. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so there's no additional 4 in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. So, in each 100-page block, there are 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many complete 100-page blocks are there in 488 pages? That's 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of these 4 blocks, there are 10 4's in the tens place, totaling 4*10 = 40. Now, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is another 10 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning 89 occurrences of the digit 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units place (48) + Tens place (50) + Hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 48 + 50 is 98, and 98 + 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach.\n\nStarting with the units place: As before, in each set of ten pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete sets of ten in 488 pages, so that's 48 occurrences. In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8, making it 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: In each 100-page block, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in each 100-page block, there are 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 complete 100-page blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), contributing 4*10 = 40 8's. Now, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. However, the tens digit is 8 for all these pages, so that's 9 occurrences. But wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought each 100-page block has 10 8's in the tens place, but here it's only 9 because we're stopping at 488. Hmm, but actually, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the pages are 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from the four blocks) + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units place (49) + Tens place (49) + Hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the units place had 49 and the tens place 49, so 98 total. But let me double-check because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 from the complete sets and 1 from 488, so 49. In the tens place, in each 100-page block, it's 10, so 4*10=40, and then in 401-488, it's 9 more, so 40+9=49. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the 4's were 187 and 8's were 98, so the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when counting the 4's in the tens place, I considered 401-488 as an extra 88 pages, and since the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, that's 10 pages, so 10 4's. So, 4 blocks *10=40, plus 10, totaling 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, for 4's, it's from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the 4's, I got 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 187. For 8's, it's 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: For each ten numbers, 4 appears once. From 1-488, there are 48 full tens (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490, but since we stop at 488, the last set is 481-488). So, 48 sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no additional 4's. So, 48.\n\nTens place: For each hundred numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more. So, total 50.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: Each ten numbers, 8 appears once. 48 full tens, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place, so 1 more, total 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. 4 full hundreds, so 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more. So, total 49.\n\nHundreds place: No 8's, as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 89, but I'm now rechecking and it still seems correct. So, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98, so 187-98=89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: in the tens place for 8's, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's. But wait, 480 is included in 401-488, right? So, pages 480,481,...,488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 488 is included, so that's one more 8.\n\nSo, 48 (units) +9 (tens) +40 (tens from full hundreds) +1 (units from last partial set) = Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up. Let me clarify:\n\nUnits place: 48 from full tens, plus 1 from 488, total 49.\n\nTens place: 40 from full hundreds, plus 9 from 480-488, total 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I initially thought the answer was 89, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nYes, I think the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once. For example, 4,14,24,... up to 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so I need to make sure I don't go beyond that. Let me calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and an extra 8 pages. In each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, in 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, adding that, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but let me double-check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. \n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving on to the 8's. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? 48 complete sets (48*10=480), and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in each complete set, 8 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. In the extra 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For the tens digit, every 100 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 8 appears 10 times in each 100 numbers. How many complete hundreds are there in 488? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 (from complete hundreds) +9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount:\n\nUnits place: 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 4, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: Each 100 numbers, 10 times. 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, 40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 8, so 48. Last 8 pages: 488, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\nTens place: Each 100 numbers, 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets (480 pages) + 8 extra pages.\n   - 48 * 1 = 48 times.\n   - In 481-488, 4 appears once (484).\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - 4 * 10 = 40 times from 1-400.\n   - In 401-488, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n   - Total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - 48 full sets (480 pages) + 8 extra pages.\n   - 48 * 1 = 48 times.\n   - In 481-488, 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - 4 * 10 = 40 times from 1-400.\n   - In 401-488, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of those 48 groups, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra numbers from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is in this range, which means the units place has one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's five blocks. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, let me check the last block. 440-449 is indeed within 488, so yes, five blocks. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for the numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. \n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Now, in the extra numbers 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is a partial block. Each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count the blocks. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so in the tens place, each number has an 8, so that's 9 8's. So total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10, which is 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks. The first four are full blocks of 10, contributing 10 each, so 4 x 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, 800-899 isn't included. Therefore, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me double-check that. For the tens place, I had 49 8's, and units place 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place. When I count 80-89, that's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, and so on. So, four full blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8, which is one more, making it 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place for 8's is zero because the book doesn't go beyond 488. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups of 10, so 48, plus in 481-488, 484 is there, so one more: 49.\n\nTens place: Five blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each contributes 10, so 5 x 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups, 48, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: Five blocks, each contributing 10 except the last one which contributes 9, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the hundreds place for 8's would be zero, but let me think again: from 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, correct, zero 8's there.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. When I count the blocks for 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks, right? So, each of the first four contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the last group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds one more 8. So, 49 in units place.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98 8's.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5 x 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in 481-488, 484 is included, so one more, making it 49. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nAnd for 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0, total 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought earlier that maybe the hundreds place for 8's might have some, but no, it's zero. So, 90 is the correct difference.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? For every 10 numbers, once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds one more 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, for 8's, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, contributing 10 each, so 4 x 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nAnd 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when counting digits, especially in different positions, it's easy to make off-by-one errors or miscount the blocks. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternative method: Instead of counting each digit place separately, perhaps I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: As before, 48 full groups of 10, so 48, plus in the last group, 484 is present, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for 400-488, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Same as before.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last group (481-488), 488 is included, which adds one more, so 49.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each hundred, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). So, for 488 pages, we have four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: As before, 800-899 isn't included, so zero.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe by using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 4's: The number of 4's in units place is the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. This is equal to the number of complete tens (48) plus 1 if 484 is within the range, which it is. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, the number of 8's in units place is the number of complete tens (48) plus 1 if 488 is within the range, which it is. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is calculated by looking at each hundred. In each hundred, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, for each hundred, that's 10 occurrences. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, in each hundred, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). So, 4 complete hundreds contribute 4 x 10 = 40. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\n- For 8's: As before, 800-899 isn't included, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think this confirms that the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each group, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is in there, which is another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, that's 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each block from 80-89, etc., has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 full blocks and one partial block. Each full block contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40, plus the last partial block from 480-488, which has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9. But in the tens place, each number from 480 to 488 has 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full groups of 10 (1-480) gives 48, plus 484 in 481-488, so 49.\n- Tens: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each 10, so 5*10=50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal: 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480) gives 48, plus 488, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) give 40, plus 480-488 gives 9, total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 (1-480), contributing 48 4's.\n   - The partial group (481-488) includes 484, adding one more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 4's.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.\n   - 48 complete groups (1-480) contribute 48 8's.\n   - The partial group (481-488) includes 488, adding one more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 8's.\n   - There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 40 8's.\n   - The partial block (480-488) contributes 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place (since pages go up to 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of these 48 groups, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 instances. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, every group of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 pages. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). In each of the 4 full groups, there are 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the extra 88 pages, from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the tens place. Specifically, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 410-420, it's 1; and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. So, in this extra part, the tens digit is 4 only once, from 440-449, which is 10 pages. Therefore, adding that to the previous 40, we get 40 + 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. Therefore, we have 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every group of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, meaning 48 full groups and 8 extra pages. So, 48 instances of 8 in the units place. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so page 488 has an 8. Therefore, units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, every group of 100 has 10 instances where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in 488 pages, how many such groups? 4 full groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, no, that's not right. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but we only have up to 488, so that's 9 pages (480-488). So, in the tens place, we have 9 more 8's. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full groups (each contributing 1) = 48, plus 1 in the extra 8 pages, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 full groups (each contributing 10) = 40, plus 10 in 440-449, total 50.\n- Hundreds: 89 pages from 400-488, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full groups, 48, plus 1 in 488, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 full groups, 40, plus 9 in 480-488, total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. Yep, that looks right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u21d2 48 full groups + 1 in the extra 8 pages.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 4's.\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88 \u21d2 4 full groups + 10 in the extra 88 pages (440-449).\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the 8's:**\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u21d2 48 full groups + 1 in the extra 8 pages.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 8's.\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88 \u21d2 4 full groups + 9 in the extra 88 pages (480-488).\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each of these 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, giving 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, in each 100 numbers, this happens once. How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of these 4 hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. Wait, but 488 is only up to 488, so the tens digit 8 is present in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from the first 400 pages) plus 10 (from 440-449), totaling 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding all the 4's together: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 times.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in every block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48 times. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so 8 appears once here (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers every 100. So, from 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's see how many full hundreds we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. In each of these, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8 in 480-488. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488, but 480 has a tens digit of 8, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding all the 8's together: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48+50=98, 98+89=187.

To find out how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full sets of 10 and a remainder of 8. So, 48 times 1 is 48. But wait, from 1 to 488, the first set is 1-10, but 10 doesn't include a 4 in the units place. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Let me check: from 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the incomplete decade. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times 1 is 48. But wait, in the last incomplete decade (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, which adds another 4.

In each full cycle of 10, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times 1 is 48. In the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, that's 1 more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each set of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds times 10 is 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so that's 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, no, each number from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, etc., but starting from 400, it's 4. So, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place: similar to 4's, in each set of 10, the units digit is 8 once. So, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nNow, tens place: similar to 4's. In each set of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). From 1-488, how many full sets of 100 are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40+9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in this book. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. From 1-488, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, yes, 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48. Then 481-488 includes 484, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10, so 40. Then 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10, so total 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing 1, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48. Then 481-488 includes 488, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then 401-488 includes 480-488, which is 9, so total 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one '4' in the units place.\n     - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full groups, contributing 48 '4's.\n     - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more.\n     - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 '4's.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each group of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's in the tens place.\n     - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 full groups, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 '4's.\n     - The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) include 440-449, adding 10 more.\n     - Total: 40 + 10 = 50 '4's.\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - Numbers 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place.\n     - 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n     - Total: 89 '4's.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one '8' in the units place.\n     - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full groups, contributing 48 '8's.\n     - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, adding 1 more.\n     - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 '8's.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each group of 100 numbers contributes 10 '8's in the tens place.\n     - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 full groups, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 '8's.\n     - The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) include 480-488, adding 9 more.\n     - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 '8's.\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - Total: 0 '8's.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the range 1-10, the digit 4 appears once (at 4), and the digit 8 appears once (at 8). This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. So, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 and then add any remaining numbers. \n\nTotal numbers: 488. So, the number of complete groups of 10 is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete groups and 8 extra numbers. \n\nIn each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place total for 4: 48 + 1 = 49. Units place total for 8: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here because 488 is the last page, so the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, right? So, in units place for 4, it's 48 (from the 48 groups) plus 1 from the last group, making 49. Similarly for 8, 48 plus 1, so 49. So, units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, actually, it's a bit different because the tens digit changes every 10 numbers. So, for the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times for 4 and 4*10=40 times for 8. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, let me think. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, but not all digits appear the same number of times. Let's see:\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we stop at 488, it's only up to 488). So, the tens digit cycles 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, but the last group (80-89) only goes up to 488, so it's 8 numbers (481-488). Wait, actually, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 8 times. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit changes every 10 pages. So, the first 10 pages after 400 are 401-410, so tens digit is 0. Then 411-420, tens digit 1, and so on up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that last group is 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears only 8 times in the last group. So, for the tens place in 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- Tens digit 1: 10 times (411-420)\n- Tens digit 2: 10 times (421-430)\n- Tens digit 3: 10 times (431-440)\n- Tens digit 4: 10 times (441-450)\n- Tens digit 5: 10 times (451-460)\n- Tens digit 6: 10 times (461-470)\n- Tens digit 7: 10 times (471-480)\n- Tens digit 8: 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, for the tens digit, in the 401-488 range, the digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, adding to the previous 40 times from the complete hundreds, the total for tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the complete hundreds (1-400), each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 each. Then, in the 401-488 range, as I calculated, 4's in tens place: 10 times (441-450), and 8's: 8 times (481-488). So, total tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nWait, but I think I might have overcounted because in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 is from 441-450, which is correct, and 8 is from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the digits:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 groups with a remainder of 8.\n   - 48 \u00d7 1 = 48, plus 1 in the remainder (484).\n   - Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 complete hundreds.\n   - 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4, 8 appears 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times.\n   - 4 complete hundreds: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488, 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 never appears as the hundreds digit since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **97**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = **91**.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14; and so on. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll consider 48 complete sets, which cover up to page 480. Each of these 48 sets contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, from 481 to 488, there are 8 more pages. In these, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in page 484. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, this happens every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Then, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times. Similarly, in 201-300, it's 240-249, and in 301-400, it's 340-349. Each of these contributes 10 4's. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's 10 more. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. The first four blocks each contribute 10 4's, so that's 4*10=40. The last block, 401-488, contributes another 10, making it 50. Wait, but 401-488 is only up to 488, and 440-449 is entirely within that range, so yes, that's 10. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's.\n\nWait, no. Wait a minute, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the tens place, I counted 50 4's, and in the units place, 49. So, total 4's would be 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let me check that again. Units place: 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4, plus one more in 484, total 49. Tens place: 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4, so 89. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10, such as 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. From 1-100: 80-89, that's 10. 101-200: 180-189, another 10. 201-300: 280-289, another 10. 301-400: 380-389, another 10. Then, 401-488: 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times, not 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (each contributing 10) and one block of 9. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and then 480-488 is 9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, total 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units place 49 + tens place 49 + hundreds place 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit is 8 in 488, so +1, total 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. So, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought the units place was 49 and tens place 49, so 98 total. Now, 4's were 188. So, the difference would be 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in 484. So, total units 4's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So, that's 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: same logic, 48 full sets, 48, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9, so 49.\n\nHundreds place: none, since 800+ is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488-400+1=89.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 4's, I had 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50.\n\nUnits place:49, as above.\n\nSo, yes, 188 4's.\n\nFor 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 4's.\n   - In 481-488, 484 adds one more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each contribute 10 4's.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488 contributes one 4 in the hundreds place for each of the 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.\n   - 48 complete sets contribute 48 8's.\n   - 488 adds one more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10 8's.\n   - 480-488 contributes 9 8's.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's count the 4's in the units place. For every group of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Now, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of these 48 groups, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so no additional 4's here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, let's count the 4's in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 for each set of ten. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, another 10 times. This pattern continues for each hundred. Now, how many hundreds do we have in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, there are 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the limit). The 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, 400 is the first number with 4 in the hundreds place, and the last is 488. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's are units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, 48 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds. So, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll count the number of 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: same as with 4's, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? 48 complete groups, as before, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8's. Similar to 4's, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each ten numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each full hundred, that's 10 8's in the tens place. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? Four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4 * 10 = 40 8's in the tens place from the full hundreds. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the limit). So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. Therefore, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8's. The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800 to 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's are 187 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: Each 10 numbers contribute 1, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so no additional 4's. So, 48 units.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. So, 50 tens.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 hundreds digit 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: Each 10 numbers contribute 1, so 48 full tens, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, so units digit 8 appears once more. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each full hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 full hundreds give 4 * 10 = 40. In the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488). So, 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: None, since the book ends at 488, which is less than 800.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one '4' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '4's.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) do not add any '4's in the units place.\n   - Total: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is '4' (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 '4's.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488), '4' appears in the tens place for 440-449, adding 10 more.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is '4' for 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one '8' in the units place.\n   - 48 complete groups contribute 48 '8's.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers include 488, adding one more '8'.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is '8' (e.g., 80-89).\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 '8's.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488), '8' appears in the tens place for 480-488, adding 9 more.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 89 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{89}"
