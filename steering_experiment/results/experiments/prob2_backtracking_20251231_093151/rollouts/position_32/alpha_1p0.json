    "text": " Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, let me check that again. Wait, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) is 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is a three-digit number. Let me confirm: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the tens digit 8, the ranges are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, that's 4*10 +9 =49, yes. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when counting the 4's, I got 188 fours, and 98 eights. So, the difference is 188 -98 =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. How many numbers? 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. 4 sets of 10 (40) and 9, so 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, so 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I included all the 4's correctly. For example, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, 440-449 is included, which is within 488, so that's fine.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is included, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, is there any overlap between the units and tens places? No, because when counting digits, each digit is considered separately. So, a number like 48 would have a 4 in the tens place and an 8 in the units place, but each digit is counted separately, so that's fine.\n\nAnother way to check is to calculate the total number of digits printed, but that might not be necessary here.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe using a formula.\n\nFor a given digit d and a range from 1 to N, the number of times d appears can be calculated by considering each digit position.\n\nBut since I've already done it manually, and the numbers add up, I think it's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each block contributes 10 numbers except the last, which contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is actually 188? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but I think I might have overcounted. Let me think again. Wait, when considering the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. For the tens place, each hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, and there are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only part of the fifth hundred block. So, for the tens place, in each full hundred block (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.), there are 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, up to 400-488, how many full hundred blocks are there? From 0-400, that's four full hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 400-488. So, in each of the four full hundred blocks, there are 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, how many numbers have tens digit 4? From 440-449, that's 10 numbers, so 10. So total in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. So that's correct. So, total fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Wait, maybe I'm double-counting some numbers where both tens and units digits are 4, like 44, 144, etc. But no, when counting digits, each occurrence is counted separately, so 44 has two 4's, so it's counted once in units and once in tens. So, that's correct. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so let's check: 8, 18, ..., 488. So, starting at 8, each step of 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, each full hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, except possibly the last one. Let's count: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, total 8's: units 49 + tens 49 + hundreds 0 = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me double-check. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each full block contributes 10, with the last block contributing 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Wait, wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me check again. For units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. The number of such numbers is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4, so actually, the number of 4's in units place is 48. Wait, but when I thought earlier, I considered 484 as the last one, which is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor((N - d)/10) + 1 if d <= N mod 10, else floor((N - d)/10) + 1? Wait, no, perhaps a better way is to consider that for each 10 numbers, the digit appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 fours. But wait, 488 is the last number, and 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place has 48 fours. Earlier, I thought 49, but now I'm getting 48. So, perhaps I was wrong before. Let me confirm: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + 10(n-1). So, 484 = 4 + 10(n-1). 480 = 10(n-1). So, n-1=48, so n=49. Wait, so that's 49 terms. So, units place has 49 fours. But when I do 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, but the 49th 4 is at 484, which is within 488, so yes, 49 fours in units place. So, that's 49. Then, tens place: as before, 10 per hundred, and there are 5 hundreds where the tens digit is 4: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in hundreds place. So total fours: 49 + 50 +89= 188. Now, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as for each digit position separately.\n\nWait, maybe I should use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if (N mod 10 >= d) else 0). Similarly for tens place, it's floor(N/100)*10 + max(0, min(10, N mod 100 - d*10 +1)).\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think step by step.\n\nSo, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: as above, 49 fours.\n\nTens place: Let's see, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 1 to 488.\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nNumber of hundreds: 4 (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 hundred, but we only go up to 488.\n\nSo, in each hundred except the last, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times.\n\nIn the last hundred (400-488), how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? It's 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 5 sets of 10, which is 50.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 +89= 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nSame method: every 10 numbers, starting at 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nWait, 488 is the last number, which ends with 8, so that's included.\n\nNumber of such numbers: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 mod 10=8, which is >=8, so it's 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\nTens place: how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nNumber of such sets: from 0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488.\n\nIn each full hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 8.\n\nIn the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 hundreds with 10 each, and the last partial hundred with 9.\n\nSo, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but wait: from 0-99: 80-89:10 numbers.\n\n100-199:180-189:10.\n\n200-299:280-289:10.\n\n300-399:380-389:10.\n\n400-488:480-488:9.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? From 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, when counting units place for 8's, I thought it was 49, because 488 is included. Let me confirm: numbers ending with 8 from 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nHow many terms? The nth term is 8 +10(n-1). So, 488=8+10(n-1). 480=10(n-1). So, n-1=48, so n=49. So, yes, 49 eights in units place.\n\nTens place: as above, 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\n4's: 188.\n\nSo, difference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 188-98=90, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting 4's.\n\nWait, units place for 4's: 49.\n\nTens place:50.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnd 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours.\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's, units place:49.\n\nTens place:49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nYes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for digit counting.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in position p (units, tens, hundreds) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nFor units place: count = (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10)\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the standard method is:\n\nTo count the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N:\n\ncount_units = (N // 10) * 1 + (1 if (N % 10 >= d) else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\ncount_tens = (N // 100) * 10 + max(0, min(10, (N % 100) - d*10 +1))\n\nAnd for hundreds place:\n\ncount_hundreds = (N // 1000) * 100 + max(0, min(100, (N % 1000) - d*100 +1))\n\nBut in our case, N=488.\n\nSo, for 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n\ncount_units = (488 //10) *1 + (1 if (488%10 >=4) else 0)\n\n488//10=48, 488%10=8 >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\ncount_tens = (488//100)*10 + max(0, min(10, (488%100) -4*10 +1))\n\n488//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\n488%100=88.\n\n88 -40 +1=49.\n\nSo, max(0, min(10,49))=10.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\ncount_hundreds = (488//1000)*100 + max(0, min(100, (488%1000) -4*100 +1))\n\n488//1000=0, so 0.\n\n488%1000=488.\n\n488 -400 +1=89.\n\nmax(0, min(100,89))=89.\n\nSo, hundreds place 4's:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\ncount_units = (488//10)*1 + (1 if (488%10 >=8) else 0)\n\n488//10=48, 488%10=8 >=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\ncount_tens = (488//100)*10 + max(0, min(10, (488%100) -8*10 +1))\n\n488//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\n488%100=88.\n\n88 -80 +1=9.\n\nmax(0, min(10,9))=9.\n\nSo, tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\ncount_hundreds = (488//1000)*100 + max(0, min(100, (488%1000) -8*100 +1))\n\n488//1000=0, so 0.\n\n488%1000=488.\n\n488 -800 +1= -311, which is negative, so max(0, ...)=0.\n\nSo, hundreds place 8's:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit position (units, tens, hundreds). Similarly, the number of times 8 appears is counted. \n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49 occurrences.\n- Tens place: 50 occurrences.\n- Hundreds place: 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49 occurrences.\n- Tens place: 49 occurrences.\n- Hundreds place: 0 occurrences.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours, plus one more at 484, making it 49. So units: 49. Tens place: In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So from 1-488, how many hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the hundreds place. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So that's 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, plus one more at 488. So units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many tens places have 8. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place: 0 eights. So total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. When I was counting the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's five sets of 10, which is 50 fours. But from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So in the hundreds place, we have 89 fours, but in the tens place, it's 50 fours. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, which is 4 full sets (each 10) and one partial set (9 numbers), totaling 49. That seems right. So I think my counts are correct, leading to 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers.  \n   - From 4, 14, 24, ..., 484:  \n     There are 49 occurrences (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers:  \n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n     Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488:  \n   - 400-488: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers:  \n   - From 8, 18, 28, ..., 488:  \n     There are 49 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers:  \n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n     The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Let's see how many full sets we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9.

    "text": " Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188? Hmm, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours, plus one more in 484, making it 49. That seems correct. In the tens place, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear? Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so for 400-488, that's one more set. Wait, actually, from 0-488, how many hundreds? Let's see: 1-99: one set (40-49), 100-199: one set (140-149), 200-299: one set (240-249), 300-399: one set (340-349), and 400-488: one set (440-449). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. In the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many sets? 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place might have 50, but actually, in the tens place, for 480-488, it's only 9 numbers, so 9 eights instead of 10. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights are 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For each hundred block:\n\n- 1-99: 80-89: 10 eights\n- 100-199: 180-189:10\n- 200-299:280-289:10\n- 300-399:380-389:10\n- 400-488:480-488:9\n\nSo that's 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place, plus 49 in units place, total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place was 49, which is correct. So, total eights: 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place had 49, which is correct, so total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for fours was 89, which is correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188 fours.\n\nFor eights, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for fours. I thought each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, and from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 4 full sets (each 10) and one partial set of 9, totaling 49. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place for fours, I had 49, which is correct because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, plus one more in 484, making 49.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the units place, 488 is included, so 49 eights.\n\nSo, I think the calculation is correct.

So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place.

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? The last page is 488, which is 8 in units place, so starting from 8, every 10 pages up to 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So total eights: 49+49=98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the number of 4's. Let's go through each digit again. For 4's: Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488:49. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Is the hundreds place for 4's correctly counted? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 98. So, difference is 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, does 488 count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 ends with 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. So, each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so that's 40 eights. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 488 is the end), so that's 9 eights. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, in the tens place, I think I made a mistake. Let me recount the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has a set where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights are 98. Wait, but earlier I thought units place had 49, tens 49, so 98. But wait, let me check units place again. From 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The sequence starts at 8 and increases by 10 each time. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. We need the last term \u2264488. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488 \u2192 (n-1)*10 \u2264480 \u2192 n-1 \u226448 \u2192 n \u226449. So, 49 terms. So units place has 49 eights. So total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, fours were 188, eights are 98. So, 188 -98 =90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check my counts. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. And in the units place, from 4, 14, 24,..., 484, which is 49 numbers. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, considering units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).

The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe I made a mistake with the fours, but I think I'm correct. Let me just double-check.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488: that's 89 numbers, correct. Tens place: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Units place:49. 50+49=99, plus 89=188.

Units place: 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times? Let me think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 48 full groups (since 48*10=480), plus one more number (484) which has a 4 in the units place. So, 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, for 1-400, that's 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place 4's are 40 +10=50. That's correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. So total 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188. Wait, that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which is 48*10 +8. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 49 numbers (since 488 is the 49th). Wait, let me see: 8,18,28,...,488. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, so 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. Now, 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I feel like maybe I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. Alternatively, for each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. For units place: For 4, as before, 49 times. For 8, 49 times. So, same in units. For tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 has one more in tens place. For hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0. So, 4 has 89 more in hundreds place. So, total difference: (49-49) in units, (50-49)=1 in tens, and (89-0)=89 in hundreds. So total difference: 0+1+89=90. That matches my previous calculation. So, I think 90 is the correct answer. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Correct. And for 8's, no hundreds digit is 8, so 0. So, the difference is 89 in hundreds place, plus 1 in tens place, so total 90. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - There are 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - There are 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 90, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to count is to consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula for each digit position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor((N +1)/10).\n\nSimilarly, for tens place: floor((N +1)/100)*10 + extra, depending on the digit.\n\nWait, maybe I can use a more systematic approach.\n\nLet me try to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n1. Units place:\n\nThe number of 4's in units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is floor(488/10) = 48, plus 1 if the units digit is >=4. Since 488's units digit is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nThe number of 4's in the tens place is calculated by considering how many complete groups of 100 there are, and then how many in the remaining part.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100 in 488 is floor(488/100)=4.\n\nEach complete group contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred).\n\nSo, 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remaining part is 488 - 400 = 88.\n\nIn the tens place, we need to see how many numbers from 400 to 488 have a tens digit of 4. That would be from 400 to 409: 10 numbers, and from 410 to 488, the tens digit is 1-8, so no more 4's in the tens place beyond 409.\n\nWait, but 400-409: tens digit is 0, right? Wait no, 400-409: the tens digit is 0, and the hundreds digit is 4. Wait, no, 400-409: the tens digit is 0, so the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me think again. The tens digit is 4 in numbers where the tens place is 4, regardless of the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the range 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199:140-149:10.\n\nFrom 200-299:240-249:10.\n\nFrom 300-399:340-349:10.\n\nFrom 400-488:440-449:10 (since 440-449 is within 400-488).\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more.\n\nSo total tens place 4's: 10*5=50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 sets, but now it's 5 sets. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nFrom 0-99: 40-49:10.\n\n100-199:140-149:10.\n\n200-299:240-249:10.\n\n300-399:340-349:10.\n\n400-488:440-449:10.\n\nSo that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n1. Units place:\n\nNumber of 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if the units digit >=8. Since 488's units digit is 8, so 48 +1=49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nNumber of 8's in tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nFrom 0-99:80-89:10.\n\n100-199:180-189:10.\n\n200-299:280-289:10.\n\n300-399:380-389:10.\n\n400-488:480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers:480,481,...,488).\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\n8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 90, but let me confirm once more.\n\nYes, so the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98, so the difference is 90. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, so total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake. Wait, in the units place, I thought it was 49, but let me recount. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So that's correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488:89. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many there are. The last number is 488, which is the 8th digit in the units place. Wait, 488 is the last page, so how many 8's in the units place? Let me calculate. The first occurrence is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers except possibly the last one. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, yes, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, zero eights here.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. When I count 80-89: that's 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place is 49, so total eights: 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no page 800 or above, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a big difference. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, earlier when I counted the 4's in the units place, I got 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89, totaling 188. For 8's, units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, totaling 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 4,14,...,484: 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nFor 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98, difference:90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me recount: from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: total number of digits in the book. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as for each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), how often does 4 and 8 appear.\n\nBut I think my initial approach is correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers in 800-899, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, that can't be right because 488 is only 488 numbers, and 188 fours seem high. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check again. Wait, in the units place, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, which gives 48 fours, plus one more in 484, making it 49. That seems correct. In the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so from 1-400, that's 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens place can be 4 again in 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is correct. So that's 50 fours in the tens place. Then the hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 fours. So total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 48*10 + 8. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1=49. So 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one which might be less. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place: 49 fours, tens place: 50 fours. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check again. For fours in the tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours. Correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, the total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is the last page, yes, it's included. So, from 8 to 488 in units place, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each full set (e.g., 80-89) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, that's 4 full sets (each contributing 10 eights) and one partial set contributing 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, is that correct? Wait, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, for the tens place of 4's, I thought it was 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Let me recount. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nFor the units place of 4's: 4,14,...,484. From 0 to 484, how many multiples of 10 plus 4? 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nFor the eights: units place, same as fours, 49 numbers.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: none, so 0.\n\nSo, 188 fours and 98 eights. Difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers, but does that affect the count? Let me check: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, correct. So, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nSo, the total eights in tens place is 49, as I had before.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 72, but maybe I was wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me recount. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSo, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188 fours.\n\nFor eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98 eights.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula for digit counting.\n\nIn a number with n digits, the number of times a digit d appears in a particular position can be calculated by considering higher, current, and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can think of each digit place separately.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me think again: from 0-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEvery block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nFrom 0-488, how many such blocks are there?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, 488 is in the 400-488 range, which is less than 500.\n\nSo, in each of the first four hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), there's one block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 each. So, 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:40+10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 0-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nAgain, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8:80-89,180-189, etc.\n\nFrom 0-488, we have 4 full hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place:4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to miscount. Let me check the hundreds place again.\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my initial calculation is correct. The number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe I should check if I'm counting correctly for the units place.\n\nFor 4's in units place: from 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nHow many terms? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with first term 4, common difference 10, last term 484.\n\nNumber of terms: ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:8,18,28,...,488.\n\nSame way: ((488-8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, units place for both digits is 49 each.\n\nTherefore, I think my count is correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. But earlier, in the units place, I thought it was 49, but let me verify that. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms can be calculated as floor(488/10) + 1 if the last term is less than or equal to 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. There are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is only from 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in each hundred block up to 400, there are 10 fours in the tens place. From 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10. So total tens place fours: 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10. So total tens fours: 40 + 10 = 50. So, that's correct. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last one is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the range. So, how many sets? Each hundred block (0-99,100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 0-99:80-89:10 numbers. From 100-199:180-189:10. From 200-299:280-289:10. From 300-399:380-389:10. From 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10, which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place eights:0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the ranges. For units place fours: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens place fours: in each hundred block (0-99,100-199, etc.) up to 400, there are 10 numbers each with tens digit 4. So, 4 blocks: 0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399. Each contributes 10, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. Correct. Hundreds place fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 mod 10. So, (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, so 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place eights: none, so 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for fours. 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And in the tens place, 50 fours. Units place, 49. So, total fours:188. Eights:98. So, difference is 90. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).

Hmm, but let me check again. Units place: 49 fours, tens place: 50 fours, hundreds place: 89 fours. So total fours are 49+50+89. Let me add them step by step: 49+50=99, then 99+89. 99+80=179, plus 9=188. So total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

For the units place, I thought 484 is the last one, so that's 484/10 = 48.4, but since 484 is included, it's 49. That seems right. For the tens place, each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-4, so 0-488 is 488 numbers, so 4 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, from 40-49 is in the first hundred (1-100), then 140-149 in the second, 240-249 in the third, 340-349 in the fourth, and 440-449 in the fifth. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred? No, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, which is the fifth hundred. So, yes, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 50. And hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, starting from 8, 18, ..., 488: that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many full sets there are and the partial set. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, and the last set 480-488 contributing 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98. Wait, that's 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me check again. Did I count correctly? For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me double-check the tens place for eights. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full sets and one partial. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. Units place for eights: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. For fours, units: up to 484, which is 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So 89 fours in the hundreds place. Then, in the tens place, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50, correct. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place? Let me see: 484 is the last one with a 4 in the units place before 488. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.

Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, not 10. So, the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) each contribute 10, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

Tens place: each hundred has 10, and from 0-400, that's 4 hundreds? Wait, no, from 0-488, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But the tens digit: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Units digit: every 10 numbers, so from 1-488, that's 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is the last page, the 48th set ends at 480, and then 484 is the next one, making it 49. So, units place has 49 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 8 appears in the units place 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: 8 is the first, then every 10. So, 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488: since 488 is the last page, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in all of these, right? Because 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but each of these has 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the 480-488 range.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10 (80-89) +10 (180-189)+10 (280-289)+10 (380-389)+9 (480-488) = 49 eights.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units and tens each had 49, so 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Let me list them:\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nThat's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct.\n\nAnd for the hundreds place, 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units:8,18,...,488:49\n- Tens:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488:49\n- Hundreds: none.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nYes, so 188-98=90.

Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The pattern is every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of such numbers is the number of times 4 appears in the units place. So, the first occurrence is at 4, and the last is at 484. The number of terms in this sequence is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many numbers that is. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89:10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so 9 numbers. So total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So yes, 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, total eights: 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but let me recount the units place for 8's. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 8, then 18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\nSo, total eights: units 49 + tens 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, for the fours, I had 49 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds, totaling 188.\n\nFor the eights, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place for fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That's 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for fours: 4,14,...,484. 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nEights: units place 49, tens place 49, so 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the hundreds place in fours? 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place for eights, I had 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

I'll go through each digit place as well. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets there are. Each set from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, and the last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers because 489 isn't included. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 488/10 = 48.8, so 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights: 49 +49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90.

So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So that's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. So 89 fours. So total fours: 49 +50 +89= 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so the last occurrence is 488. How many such numbers? Using the same formula: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488), since 489 is beyond 488. So, for the tens place, 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)= 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). The count is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\text{ times}\n     \\]\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50 \\text{ times}\n     \\]\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is:\n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\text{ times}\n     \\]\n   - **Total 4's:** \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\)\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). The count is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\text{ times}\n     \\]\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, ..., 380-389). Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\text{ times}\n     \\]\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\)\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   \\[\n   188 \\text{ (4's)} - 98 \\text{ (8's)} = 90\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. For the units place, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, but we have to include the last partial set if any. Since 488 is the last page, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there? From 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. So, tens place: 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 0-99: 80-89:10, 100-199:180-189:10, 200-299:280-289:10, 300-399:380-389:10, and 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the hundreds place, the 480-488 block only has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 block, so the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9 =49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, when I count the units place for 8's, I think I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The difference between terms is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place:49.\n\nTens place: As above, 49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 188 and 8's 98, so 90 more 4's. But let me double-check my counting.\n\nWait, for the tens place in 4's, I had 50, which included 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the hundreds place, none, since the book ends at 488, which is less than 800.\n\nSo, yes, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference:90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the tens place in 4's? Each hundred block from 0-99, 100-199, etc., up to 400-488. So, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nUnits place: both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences each? Wait, no, for 4's, units place was 49, and for 8's, units place was 49 as well.\n\nWait, but let me check 4's units place again. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1)=484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 terms, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. 488=8+10*(n-1), so 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 terms, correct.\n\nSo, 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of 4's = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   Number of 4's = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in numbers 400-488.  \n   Number of 4's = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of 8's = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 4 such blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).  \n   Additionally, in the 400-488 range, 480-488 contributes 9 numbers.  \n   Number of 8's = (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Number of 8's = 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is actually 188? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Units place: 49 fours, tens place: 50 fours, hundreds place: 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the hundreds place is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours there. In the tens place, every hundred has 10 fours, so 40-49, 140-149, etc. Up to 440-449. So that's 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in each hundred, except the last one, it's 10 fours in the tens place. But in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens place can go up to 488, so 440-449 is within that. So, in each of the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), there are 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So that's 50 fours in the tens place. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. Units place: every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. From 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many? Let's see: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full groups, each contributing a 4, and then the 49th is 484. So 49 fours in the units place. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, but 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so numbers are 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So yes, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nSo total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So 0 eights here.\n\nSo total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So yes, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place for 8's would be zero, which is correct.\n\nSo now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n -6. Wait, 4=10*1 -6? No, wait, 4=10*0 +4, 14=10*1 +4, 24=10*2 +4, etc. So the nth term is 10(n-1)+4. So when does 10(n-1)+4=484? Let's solve for n: 10(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So 49 terms, which is 49 fours in the units place. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 fours. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 +10*(n-1)=488 =>10(n-1)=480 =>n-1=48 =>n=49. So 49 eights in the units place.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, as before.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any chance I'm overcounting? For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but when considering the tens and units places, are there any overlaps where a number has both a 4 in the hundreds and a 4 in the tens or units? But when counting the number of digits, each digit position is considered separately, so overlapping doesn't affect the count. So, for example, 444 has a 4 in hundreds, tens, and units, so it's counted three times, once in each position. So, the total count is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, numbers like 488 have 8 in tens and units, so they are counted twice, but that's correct because each digit is counted separately.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, the number of 8's is 98, so 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None (since 800-899 exceeds 488).\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but the last partial ten (480-488) includes 484, so that's 49 times. Okay, that's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so from 1-400, there are 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), which is 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50. That seems right. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in units place is 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. Starting at 8, each 10 numbers, so 8,18,28,...,488. To find how many, we can take 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within 488, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89 eights. Wait, that seems correct. So, total fours are 188, and total eights are 89. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that can't be right because when I subtract 89 from 188, I get 99. But let me double-check my counts because 188 fours and 89 eights seems like a big difference. Let me recount the fours and eights to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with fours: Units place: 49, Tens place:50, Hundreds place:89. Total:188. Eights: Units place:49, Tens place:40, Hundreds place:0. Total:89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check another way. Maybe I can think about how many times each digit appears in each position. For units digit: For 488 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears in the units place approximately 48 or 49 times. Specifically, 488 /10 =48.8, so 49 times for 4 and 8, and 48 times for others. So, units digit: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought 8 appears 49 times in units, which matches. But for fours, I had 49 in units, 50 in tens, and 89 in hundreds. Let me check tens digit for fours: Each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so from 1-400, that's 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50. That's correct. For eights in tens place: Each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), which is 4*10=40. That's correct. For hundreds place: 400-488 gives 89 fours, and no eights. So, fours: 49+50+89=188. Eights:49+40+0=89. So, the difference is indeed 188 -89=99. Therefore, there are 99 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 40 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 40 + 0 = **89**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = **99**\n\n$\\boxed{99}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, the 49th occurrence is at 484. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: as above, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, but the last set, 480-488, has only 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 eights in tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in hundreds place. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Wait, but earlier I thought the tens place had 49, so total eights would be 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, did I make a mistake in counting? Let me double-check the fours again. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That seems right. And for eights, the hundreds place is zero because we don't reach 800. So, yes, 98 eights. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check again. For tens place, fours occur in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. That's correct. So, 50 fours in tens place. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Eights: 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in every 10th number: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   Total occurrences: 50 (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in numbers 400-488.  \n   Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in every 10th number: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9.  \n   Total occurrences: 49 (10+10+10+10+9).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.  \n   Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Units place: 49 fours, tens place: 50 fours, hundreds place: 89 fours. So 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct because in the hundreds place, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, which is a lot. So, total fours: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, the book goes up to 488, so 480-489 would be beyond 488, so we only go up to 488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). So that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, the number of times is floor(488 / 10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is 8. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, and the 49th occurrence is at 488. So, yes, 49 eights in the units place.\n\nTens place: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10. So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, totaling 40.\n\nSo total eights: 49 + 40 = 89.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 89. So, the difference is 188 - 89 = 99.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Maybe I should recount.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. So, how many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 4 + 10(n-1) = 484 => 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 fours in units.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks. So, 5*10=50 fours in tens.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488.

    "text": " Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, no, 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, does that make sense? Let me check again. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? Starting from 8, every 10 numbers. So, from 8 to 488, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 has 8 in the tens place. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. For the tens place of fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place: 49 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For eights: units place, 49; tens place, 49; so 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me check again. From 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 5*10=50. That's correct. So, 50 in the tens place. Units place: 49. Hundreds place: 89. So total fours: 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, so 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? The last one is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers, right? Because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, since 488-480+1=9. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) have 10 eights in the tens place. The last set, 480-488, has 9 eights. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the tens place again. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9, totaling 49. So yes, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when I counted the fours in the units place, I thought it was 49, but let me check again. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers is that? Let's see, the first number is 4, and the last is 484. The difference between 484 and 4 is 480, and since we're stepping by 10, that's 480/10=48 steps, plus 1 for the starting number, so 49. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of those is 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets, so 50. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. That seems correct.\n\nFor the eights:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the last, so (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThus, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 90, but I'm not sure if I missed something. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit position separately for both fours and eights.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: floor(488/10) = 48 full tens, plus the 4 in 484, so 49.\n\n- Tens: floor(488/100)*10 + min(488%100, 90 - 40 +1) ? Wait, maybe a better way is to consider that in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 fours. So, up to 400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10.

    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which gives 48 fours, and then an extra 4 in 484, so total 49 fours in units place. Tens place: in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so from 1-400, that's 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So, 40+10=50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which gives 48 eights, and then an extra 8 in 488, so total 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these is 10 numbers per hundred. From 1-400, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the next set would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, from 400-488, we have 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me check my counting again to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = floor(484/10) +1 = 48 +1 =49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. There are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only part of the 400s. So, in the tens place, for each hundred, it's 10 numbers. So, for 0-99: 40-49:10, 100-199:140-149:10, 200-299:240-249:10, 300-399:340-349:10, and 400-488:440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.

I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488. So, how many numbers? The first is 8, then every 10. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. The last term is 488. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. (n-1)*10 = 480. n-1=48. n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 480s. So, let's count each block. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check the counts. For the tens place in eights: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. Units place: 8,18,...,488:49. Correct. So total eights:49+49=98. 4's:188. So difference:188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Wait, let me check again. Wait, the hundreds place: from 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Then, the tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, and there are 5 hundreds (0-9, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but from 400-488, the tens digit 4 is only up to 449, right? Because 450-488 don't have 4 in the tens place. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, we have 400-488: 89 numbers, and in the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. That's 49 numbers because 484 is the 49th occurrence. So total fours: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me see how many that is. The last number is 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers with tens digit 8, except the last one which only goes up to 488. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers). Wait, no, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers? Wait, 480 is the first, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, right? So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's in the units, tens, and hundreds places. Units place: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems right. For the 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th occurrence. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Yes, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That's correct. So, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 fours. But wait, the last number is 488, which ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, but 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, right? So, 4, 14, ..., 484: that's 49 numbers because it includes 0 as well? Wait no, because page numbers start at 1, so 4 is the first, then 14, etc., up to 484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 10n - 6, where n=1 gives 4, n=2 gives 14, etc. Wait, actually, it's simpler to think of it as starting at 4 and adding 10 each time. So, the number of terms is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. That would be (484)/10 = 48.4, so floor(48.4) is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, units place has 49 fours. That seems correct. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours:49 +50 +89= 188. Now, let me check the 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80s,180s,280s,380s) which is 4*10=40, plus the 480s which have 9. So, total 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours.**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 eights each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total: 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98 eights.**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 fours - 98 eights = **90 more fours than eights.**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, no, wait. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188? Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me check again. Wait, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) gives 188 fours in total. Now, let me check if I counted correctly. For units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 fours, but since 488 is included, the 48th set ends at 480, so the next 4 is at 484, which is within the range. So that's 49 fours in the units place. That seems correct. For the tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 40-49, 140-149, etc. Up to 440-449. So that's 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since the book stops at 488, the tens place 4 in 440-449 is still valid. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. That seems correct. For the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's check each hundred: 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many eights in the tens place? Each hundred except the last one contributes 10 eights, and the last hundred contributes 9. So, 4 hundreds (0-399) each contribute 10, and 400-488 contributes 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for the tens place in eights: when I considered 400-488, I thought the tens digit 8 would be in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But does 480-488 include 480 to 488 inclusive? Yes, that's 9 numbers. So, 4 hundreds before that (0-399) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9, giving 49 eights in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place: from 8,18,...,488, which is 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, 49 eights.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I counted fours, I got 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the fours:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Correct.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours was 89, but let me check that again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for fours: 4,14,...,484. 484 is 48*10 +4, so that's 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** '4' appears in 4,14,24,...,484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.

There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'. \n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Wait, let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units? Let me think: 4 appears every 10 numbers, so total occurrences would be floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is 48*10 + 8, the last occurrence is 484, which is the 49th. So units: 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so from 1-400, that's 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So 89. So total 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so how many? From 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would also have 8 in tens place, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, how many sets? From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9 in the last set. So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So tens place:49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Wait, in the units place, I thought it was 49 fours, but maybe that's incorrect. Let me recalculate the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The number of terms can be calculated as ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, that's correct, 49 fours in the units place. In the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 hundred blocks where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. In the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcounting. Wait, for example, the number 444 would have been counted in both the hundreds, tens, and units places. But that's okay because each digit is counted separately. So, 444 would contribute three 4's, which is correct. So, total fours: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place except the last one, which might be less. Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, so total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts for 8's in the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. Then 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8's again. From 8,18,28,...,488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th term. So, 49 eights in units place.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nTotal fours: 188.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought maybe the hundreds place for 8's would be zero, which is correct. So, the total number of 8's is 98, and fours are 188, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting fours. Let me recount:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,...,484: 49 fours.\n\nTens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50 fours.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488:89 fours.\n\nTotal: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488:49.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90 more fours.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought the answer might be different, but perhaps 90 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 440-449 is included, which is correct because 440 is less than 488. So, that's 10 numbers.\n\nSo, I think the count is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98, so the difference is 90.

This gives 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, no, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) is 188. Hmm, that seems correct because from 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 50 numbers, and the units digit is 4 for 49 numbers. So total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last occurrence is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Each hundred has one set of 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because I thought the tens place had 49, but let me check again. Wait, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought the units place had 49, and the tens place had 49, so 98 eights in total. Now, the fours were 188, and eights were 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the fours in the units place. Let me double-check. Units place for fours: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. That's correct. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total eights:98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for fours would be 89, which is correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers. But for eights, the hundreds place doesn't contribute anything, which is correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9 (since 488 is the last page).\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
