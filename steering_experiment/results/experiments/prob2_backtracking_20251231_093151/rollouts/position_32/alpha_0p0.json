    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last one ending with 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the integer part of 488 divided by 10, which is 48, but since 484 is included, it's actually 49 times because 4,14,...,484 is 49 numbers (since 484 is the 49th occurrence). So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: As I thought earlier, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so from 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many hundreds are there? From 1-400, there are four hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only part of the fifth hundred. So, for the tens place, in each complete hundred (like 1-99, 100-199, etc.), there are 10 fours in the tens place. So, for 1-399, that's 4 hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens fours: 40 +10=50. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89 (from 400-488). So total fours:49+50=99+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Similar to fours, but let's check. The tens digit is 8 in numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. So, how many sets of 10 numbers have 8 in the tens place? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, etc.) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights:0. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98. So, number of fours:188, number of eights:98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check if I made a mistake in counting. Maybe in the hundreds place for fours, I overcounted. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, I had 50 fours, which seems right. Units place:49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This gives 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would be 49 numbers, but let me check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds one more 8 in the units place. So, 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would be the tens place as 8. Let me count each block. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, that's 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. Using the same formula: (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90.

Let me check: tens place for fours: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, so the difference is 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Let's see how many times that happens. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers.

Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included. Wait, 8*61=488, so 8 appears in the units place 61 times? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. So, it's like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many terms there are, we can think of it as starting at 8 and adding 10 each time until we reach 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. Let's solve for n: 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, 49 times.

But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many full sets we have. Each full set (e.g., 80-89) has 10 numbers, so 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights. Now, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place.

Wait, but 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place. Wait, no, in the tens place, it's just 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, does 480-488 count? Wait, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but actually, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's an extra 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but the tens digit is 8, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 eights in the tens place. So, 1-100: 80-89:10, 101-200:180-189:10, 201-300:280-289:10, 301-400:380-389:10. Then, 401-488: the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 (total 40) plus 9, so 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because when I counted the tens place, I thought it was 49, but let me double-check. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 1-488, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which we've already counted. There's no hundreds digit of 8, so that's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so total 98. Now, earlier I thought fours were 188 and eights are 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. Let me recount the tens place eights. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, that's correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.

So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     5 \\text{ ranges} \\times 10 \\text{ numbers per range} = 50\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ full ranges} \\times 10 \\text{ numbers} + 9 \\text{ numbers in 480-488} = 40 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     0\n     \\]\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 \\, (\\text{fours}) - 98 \\, (\\text{eights}) = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Let me check how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10). So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, let's see: Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), right? So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check the tens place for eights again. When counting the tens place eights, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the first four are full decades, each contributing 10 eights, and the last one is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49, which is correct. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98 total eights. So, 188-98=90.

So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recount the hundreds place for fours: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place for fours: 49, tens place:50. 49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. 188-98=90.

The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last).

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would be 49 numbers because 8*49=482? Wait, no, wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488.

Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers? Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when I was counting the units place for fours, I thought 4,14,...484 gives 49 numbers. Let me confirm: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place, fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. So, 89 fours. So total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...488. As calculated, 49 eights.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four is 10 numbers, the last is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: none, so 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed anything. For example, in the hundreds place for fours, is it 400-488 inclusive? Yes, that's 89 numbers. For eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nYes, I think that's right.

The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 8 is at 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me count: from 0 to 488, that's 49 numbers (including both 8 and 488). Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many full sets we have. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, so 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total eights in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. Let me double-check the eights in the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hmm, that seems correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens place:49, total eights:98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about the hundreds place for fours, I counted 89 fours, but maybe I should check that again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. So, 89 fours in hundreds, 50 in tens, 49 in units: total 188. Eights: 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: total 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in different places, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me verify the units place for fours. Units digit 4 occurs at 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4 + 10k where k=0 to n. The last term is 484=4+10k => 10k=480 => k=48. So, k=0 to 48, which is 49 terms. So, units place:49 fours. Tens place: as above, 50 fours. Hundreds place:89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights: units place:49, tens place:49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check again. The tens digit is 4 in numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. That's correct. For eights, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers, so 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, the calculation seems right. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each place again: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, I can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488.

So, 0 eights here. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct.

Units place fours: 4,14,...484. Let's see, 484 is the 49th number because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. For eights, units place: 8,18,...488. 488 is the 49th number because (488-8)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 5 sets. The first four are 10 each, and the last is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, yes, 98 eights. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To count how many, I can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let me check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, the tens place for 8: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. So total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, the first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. To count how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place of fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, except the last block which only goes up to 488, giving 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? From 0-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and then 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks, but the last one has 9 instead of 10.

Wait, but let me double-check the tens place for eights. Wait, when I did the tens place, I thought of 80-89 as one block, 180-189 as another, etc., up to 480-488.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought units place had 49 eights and tens had 49, so 98 total. Now, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, (n-1)*10 \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, 49 terms. So, units place:49 eights. Tens place: as above, 49. So, total eights:49 + 49 = 98.

Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but does 488 count? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers up to 488. So, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, does 480-489 include 488? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, the tens place 8 in 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98.

For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

The last occurrence in units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's see: each 100 block has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1=9). So total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So yes, 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 48 full sets, but does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

    "text": " Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 fours, tens place: 50 fours, hundreds place: 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, which is correct. So, 5 sets of 10 in the tens place for fours: 50. Units place: 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90.

The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which gives 48 eights. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 488 is the 49th number where the units digit is 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the tens place. For the tens digit being 8, the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, each of the first four ranges contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40, and the last range, 480-488, is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1=48+1=49. So, units:49. Tens place:40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block contributes 10, and there are 5 blocks (40-49 is the first, then 140-149, etc.), so 5*10=50. So, tens:50. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, hundreds:89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: Units:49, as 8,18,...,488. Tens:49, as calculated. So, total eights:98. So, 188 -98=90.
