    "text": " So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences (since 488 is included). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, since the book ends at 488, 480-489 is also included, but 480-488 is within the book. So, each of these blocks has 10 numbers. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, does 480-489 count as a full set? No, because the book ends at 488, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 5 blocks, but the last block has only 9 numbers. So, the total eights in the tens place are 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Alternatively, I can think that up to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.

Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count each set: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Wait, 480-489 is beyond 488, so the last one is 380-389. Let's check: From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, so 40 eights in the tens place. But wait, 380-389 is up to 389, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 40 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, total eights: 89. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 89 eights: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. Total 89. Difference: 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 50 fours in tens place. That's correct. For eights, tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 sets, so 40 eights. Correct. Units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each, from 4 to 484 for fours, and 8 to 488 for eights. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so for 8's in units place, it's from 8,18,...,488. How many numbers is that? The formula is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1. (488-8)=480, 480/10=48, so 48+1=49. So that's correct. Similarly for fours: from 4 to 484, which is 484-4=480, 480/10=48, +1=49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 188 - 89 = 99.

    "text": " So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, which would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total tens place eights: 10*4 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 10 each: 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488: (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks with 10 eights each (totaling 40) and one block with 9 eights, making it 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place.

I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places in the page numbers from 1 to 488. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each full block (like 80-89) has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many full blocks there are. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Now, the last partial block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the eights in the tens place. So, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 eights, so 4 blocks \u00d710 =40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 +9=49. That seems correct. For the fours, the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours there. Tens place: 5 sets of 10 (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. Units place: 49 fours. So, 89+50=139, plus 49 is 188. That seems correct. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is indeed 90. Wait, but I thought maybe I missed something because 90 seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the units place for fours. Let me check again. Units place for fours: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly, for eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. Same calculation: ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for fours: 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Tens place for eights: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 49. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 89, correct. Hundreds place for eights: 0, correct. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 sets of 10 \u2192 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 sets of 10 + 9 \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's as pages go up to 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so the count is 49, right? Because starting from 8, every 10 numbers up to 488. Let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

Now, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, total eights in the tens place are 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but wait: 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49.

Wait, that's 49? Wait, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right because 49+49=98, but let me double-check. Units place: 49 eights, tens place: 49 eights, so total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but that seems high. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something in the hundreds place for eights, but no, it's zero.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last set. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place except possibly the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 eights because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers, but wait, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for 480-488. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but let me double-check. The first four sets are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: each has 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9 more. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, it's 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place.

So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.

Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last number with 8 in the units place before 488 is 488 itself. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which gives 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

Each full block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last one, but 489 isn't included).

So total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98.

Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

So, that's 5 blocks, but the last one has 9 instead of 10. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks with 10 and 1 block with 9, so 4*10 +9=49.

The last occurrence is 488, which is the units place. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but we need to include 488, so it's 49 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms?

Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, except possibly the last one. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, no, 4 sets of 10 would be 40, plus 9 from the last set, so 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. But wait, I think I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me double-check. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188 -98=90. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 188-98 is 90? Let me check the calculations again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the fours or the eights. Let me go back. Counting fours: units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 times, right? So units:49. Tens place: in each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, from 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. So, tens:50. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: units place. Every 10 numbers, 8,18,...,488. So, 488 is 10*48 +8, so that's 49 numbers, so 49 eights in units. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different. Let me check if I counted correctly. Alternatively, maybe I should use a formula or a different method to verify. Alternatively, I can think of each digit place separately and calculate how many times each digit appears. For units place: For any digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to n is floor((n +1)/10). So, for 4 in units place up to 488: floor((488 +1)/10)=floor(489/10)=48.9, which is 48. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Wait, let me think. The formula is that the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor((n + (10 - d))/10). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, the number of times a digit appears in the units place is the number of complete decades plus one if the last digit is >=d. For example, up to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, how many complete decades are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the incomplete decade, 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So total units place fours:48 +1=49. That matches my earlier count. Similarly, for eights in units place: up to 488, the units digit cycles 48 times, each contributing one 8, and in the incomplete cycle, 480-488, 8 appears at 488. So, 48 +1=49. So, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights. Now, for the tens place: For fours in the tens place, it's similar. Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there up to 488? 488 is in the 400s, so 4 hundreds. Wait, no, 488 is in the 400-488 range, so the hundreds are 1,2,3,4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, for each hundred, there's one block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, up to 400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. But wait, 400-488 is only part of the 400s. Wait, no, the tens digit being 4 in 400-488 would be in 440-449. So, that's another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: from 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So, that's 5 blocks of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Similarly, for eights in the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Now, for the hundreds place: fours appear in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Eights in the hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place, so 0. So, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 eights, except the last block which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're including 488, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, adding these up: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49.

Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for fours, I considered up to 440-449, which is correct because 440-449 is within 488. And for eights in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct. But wait, 400-488 inclusive is 89 numbers, so that's correct. For eights, hundreds place is zero, correct. So, the difference is 90.

Let's see, the last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, 8, 18, ..., 488: that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 would be part of that. Let me check how many sets there are. Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no: 80-89 is 10 numbers, same for the others, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, the tens place has 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So total eights: 98. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place count. Let me check again. For the tens place, the sets are: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. That's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 has 8 in the tens place. Let's see: Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me verify the hundreds place for 4's: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct. For 8's, hundreds place is 0, correct. Units place for 4's: from 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. Similarly, units place for 8's: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449: 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 50. Tens place for 8's: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, that seems correct. So, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference is 90.

Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's the 49th multiple of 10 where the units digit is 8. Wait, no, actually, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me see: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so the number of 8's in the units place is 49, because it includes 8, 18, ..., 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers).

So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n   \n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. Let me count how many numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, 8, 18, ..., 488: that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For the 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That looks right. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

The last occurrence is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it starts at 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, how many sets do we have? Each set is 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 40 eights. But wait, 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488 as well. Wait, no, 480-488 is part of the hundreds place being 4, but the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 more from 480-488. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 sets of 10, which would be 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counting to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when counting the tens place for 4's, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. But let me check again: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10 fours in the tens place, so 50 fours. That seems correct.\n\nFor the units place, both 4's and 8's had 49 occurrences. But wait, for 8's, from 8, 18, ..., 488, that's (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So that's correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 8's, I had 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 4's had 89 occurrences (from 400-488). That's correct because 488 - 400 +1 =89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the units place for 8's, from 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 units, 49 tens, and 0 hundreds, totaling 98 eights.\n\nAnd for 4's, 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds, totaling 188.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the hundreds place, 4's go from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. That's correct because 488-400+1=89.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, and since we have 5 hundred blocks where the tens digit is 4 (40-49,140-149, etc.), that's 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nIn the units place, both 4's and 8's have 49 occurrences because the last occurrence is at 484 for 4's and 488 for 8's, which is the 49th number in each sequence.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 90 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's check each block. From 1-100: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189 is another 10. From 201-300: 280-289 is another 10. From 301-400: 380-389 is another 10. From 401-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, adding up: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So, how many such sets? Each set is 10 numbers. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, so 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book goes up to 488, that's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers.

So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 0 to 484, how many numbers? 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - There are 49 such numbers (from 0 to 484, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - There are 89 such numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - There are 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any hundreds place within 1-488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, each step is 10. So, the number of 8's in the units place is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each of these blocks (except maybe the last one) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, right? Wait, 480 is the first, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for 480-488. So total tens place eights: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I said 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. And 40-49, 140-149, etc., all within 488, so 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=49. Correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total fours:188, eights:98.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).

For the eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10*4 +9=49. Correct.
