    "text": " Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using a formula or a more systematic way. For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Let me try that approach.\n\nFor the units digit:\n- For each position, the digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 488 numbers, how many full cycles of 10 are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48*1=48 fours, but wait, in each cycle, the units digit goes from 0-9, so each digit appears once per cycle. But since we're starting from 1, the first cycle is 1-10, which includes 0 in the units place for 10. Hmm, maybe this approach is more complicated. Alternatively, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor((N)/10) + (if the last digit is >=d, add 1). So, for 4 in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488's units digit is 8 >=4, add 1, so 49. Similarly for 8: floor(488/10)=48, and 8<=8, so add 1, total 49. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nFor the tens place:\n- The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to N can be calculated by considering the higher digits and the lower digits. The formula is a bit more involved. For a number like ABC (hundreds, tens, units), the count for digit d in the tens place is:\n  - Higher part: A\n  - Current part: B\n  - Lower part: C+1\n\nIf B > d, then count += (Higher part +1)*10\nIf B == d, count += (Higher part)*10 + (Lower part)\nIf B < d, count += (Higher part)*10\n\nBut since I'm dealing with 488, which is a three-digit number, let's break it down.\n\nFor 4 in the tens place:\n- The tens digit is 4 in numbers from X40 to X49, where X is 0,1,2,3,4. But since we're starting from 1, X can be 0 (for 40-49), 1 (140-149), etc., up to 4 (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid.\n\nSo, for each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times per block. How many full hundred blocks do we have? 4 (since 400-488 is the last partial block). So, 0-99: 40-49 (10)\n100-199:140-149 (10)\n200-299:240-249 (10)\n300-399:340-349 (10)\n400-488:440-449 (10)\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8 in the tens place:\n- The tens digit is 8 in numbers X80-X89. So, X can be 0,1,2,3,4. But in the last block (400-488), X is 4, so 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, number of times 8 appears in tens place:\n- 0-99:80-89 (10)\n- 100-199:180-189 (10)\n- 200-299:280-289 (10)\n- 300-399:380-389 (10)\n- 400-488:480-488 (9)\nTotal:10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n- For 4, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n- For 8, since the book ends at 488, there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 eights.\n\nAdding up, fours:49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188\nEights:49(units)+49(tens)+0(hundreds)=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, I think 90 is the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try a different approach, maybe by writing out a small range and seeing the pattern.\n\nFor example, let's take pages 1-10:\nPage numbers:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\nCount of 4's:1 (page4)\nCount of 8's:1 (page8)\nDifference:0\n\nPages 1-20:\nIn units place:4,14\nIn tens place:40-49 (but 40-49 is beyond 20, so only 4 and 14)\nWait, 1-20:\n4,14: two fours\n8,18: two eights\nSo, fours:2, eights:2, difference:0.\n\nWait, but in 1-20, 4's are at 4,14 and 8's at 8,18, so same count.\n\nWait, but in 1-100, how does it go?\n\nWait, maybe this approach is complicating. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a formula for digit counting.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N is a bit involved, but I think I can apply it here.\n\nFor units place:\nNumber of 4's = floor(488/10) + (if 488 mod 10 >=4, add 1)\nfloor(488/10)=48, 488 mod10=8>=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, 488 mod10=8>=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\nThe formula is a bit more complex. Let me denote the number as ABC, where A is hundreds, B is tens, C is units.\n\nFor each digit position, the count is calculated as:\nhigher = number formed by digits higher than current\ncurrent = current digit\nlower = number formed by digits lower than current\n\nFor the tens place, the formula is:\nif current > d: count += (higher +1) * 10\nif current == d: count += (higher) *10 + (lower +1)\nif current < d: count += higher *10\n\nBut let's apply this for 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor the number 488, the tens digit is 8, but we're looking for 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of each hundred block.\n\nFrom 0-99:\nTens digit 4 appears in 40-49:10 times.\n\nFrom 100-199:\nTens digit 4 appears in 140-149:10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299:240-249:10\n300-399:340-349:10\n400-488:440-449:10 (since 449 <488)\n\nSo, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 fours in tens place.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in tens place:\n\nFrom 0-99:80-89:10\n100-199:180-189:10\n200-299:280-289:10\n300-399:380-389:10\n400-488:480-488:9\n\nTotal:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, again, same result.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488:89 numbers.\n\n8 appears in 800-899, but since we're only going up to 488, 0 times.\n\nSo, total fours:49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188\nTotal eights:49(units)+49(tens)+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think I've verified it enough ways. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
