    "text": " Another way to check: Let me think about how many 4's in each position. Units: For every 10 numbers, there's one 4. From 1 to 488, that's 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20,...,481-490), but wait, 488 is less than 490, so actually, there are 48 complete decades (each contributing one 4 in units place) and then from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, but 484 is within this, so that's another 4 in units place. So, 48*1 +1=49. Correct. Similarly, tens place: For every 100 numbers, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 400/100=4 full centuries, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, but wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, actually, in each block of 100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10), 101-200:140-149 (10), 201-300:240-249 (10), 301-400:340-349 (10), and 401-488:440-449 (10). Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. For 8's, units place: same logic, 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, so 0 is correct.

    "text": " Maybe I should check an alternative way. Let me think about the total number of digits. But no, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can think about how many times each digit appears in each position. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total:188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. Maybe I can test with a smaller number to see if the method works. Let's say a 20-page book. How many 4's and 8's? Page numbers 1-20. Counting 4's: units:4,14 (2), tens:40-49 but we only go up to 20, so no 4's in tens place. Hundreds: none. So, 2 fours. 8's: units:8,18 (2), tens:80-89, but we only go up to 20, so no 8's in tens place. So, 2 eights. So, difference is 0. Using the same method: For 20 pages, 4's: units: (20//10)=2, tens: 0, hundreds:0. Total 2. 8's: units:2, tens:0. Total 2. Difference 0. Correct. So, the method works for this small case. Another test: 50 pages. 4's: units:5 (4,14,24,34,44), tens:5 (40-49:10 numbers, but wait, 40-49 is 10 numbers, but in 50 pages, 40-49 is included, so 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in tens place. So, tens:10. Units:5. Hundreds:0. Total 15. 8's: units:5 (8,18,28,38,48), tens:5 (40-49: but wait, 80-89 is beyond 50, so only 8 in units place. Wait, no, 80-89 is beyond 50, so in 50 pages, the tens digit 8 doesn't appear. So, 8's: units:5, tens:0. Total 5. So, difference is 15-5=10. Let me count manually: Page numbers 1-50. Number of 4's: 4,14,24,34,44 (5), and 40-49 (10). So, 5+10=15. Number of 8's:8,18,28,38,48 (5). So, 15-5=10. Correct. So, the method works.

    "text": " Let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula or digit-by-digit analysis. Alternatively, I could calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For the units digit: In any range, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often. So, for the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear? Well, the total number of page numbers is 488. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488). Each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, and then the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so digits 1-8 appear once more. So, digits 0 appears 48 times, 1-8 appear 49 times, and 9 appears 48 times. So, for units place, 4 appears 49 times, and 8 appears 49 times. That matches my earlier count. For the tens place: Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 times for each digit. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0-8 (since 488 is the last). So, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 100 numbers, but here we only have 88 numbers (401-488). So, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-488). Each of these tens digits appears 9 times except for 8, which appears 8 times (since 481-488 is 8 numbers). Wait, no: 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers. 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers. Similarly up to 471-480: tens digit 7, 10 numbers. Then 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 numbers. So, in 401-488, the tens digits are 0-8, with 0-7 each appearing 10 times, and 8 appearing 8 times. So, for the tens place in 401-488: 0:10, 1:10, 2:10, 3:10, 4:10, 5:10, 6:10, 7:10, 8:8. So, adding to the 400 times from the first 4 hundreds: 4*10=40 for each digit. So, total for each digit in tens place:\n\n- 0:40 +10=50\n- 1:40 +10=50\n- 2:40 +10=50\n- 3:40 +10=50\n- 4:40 +10=50\n- 5:40 +10=50\n- 6:40 +10=50\n- 7:40 +10=50\n- 8:40 +8=48\n- 9:40 +0=40\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because earlier I counted 49 eights in the tens place. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Wait, the total number of page numbers is 488, so when considering the tens place, from 1-488, how many times does each digit appear? Let me approach it differently. The number of times a digit appears in the tens place can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.), each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds (1-400), that's 4*10=40 times per digit. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, in 401-488, the tens digits are 0-8. Each tens digit from 0-7 appears 10 times (e.g., 401-410: 10 numbers with tens digit 0), and tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, for the tens place:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 40 (from 1-400) +10 (from 401-488) =50 each.\n- Digit 8:40 +8=48.\n- Digit 9:40 +0=40.\n\nWait, but earlier I counted 49 eights in the tens place. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check where I went wrong. Earlier, when I counted the eights in the tens place, I considered:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nThat's 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nBut according to this analysis, the total number of eights in the tens place is 48. So, which one is correct? Let me recount the 480-488 part. 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for 480-488. Then, the earlier sets:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n\nThat's 4 sets, each with 10 eights in the tens place, totaling 40. Plus the 9 from 480-488: 40+9=49. So, that's 49 eights in the tens place. But according to the per-digit analysis, it's 48. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the per-digit analysis is missing something. Let me check the per-digit analysis again. From 1-400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0-8. So, for each tens digit from 0-7, they appear 10 times in 401-488, and 8 appears 8 times. So, total for each digit:\n\n- 0-7:40 +10=50\n- 8:40 +8=48\n- 9:40 +0=40\n\nBut wait, that would mean that in the entire 1-488, digit 8 appears 48 times in the tens place, but according to the earlier count, it's 49 times. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the per-digit analysis is incorrect because in 401-488, the tens digit for 480-488 is 8, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times, not 8. Let me recount 401-488:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers\n- 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers\n- 421-430: tens digit 2, 10 numbers\n- 431-440: tens digit 3, 10 numbers\n- 441-450: tens digit 4, 10 numbers\n- 451-460: tens digit 5, 10 numbers\n- 461-470: tens digit 6, 10 numbers\n- 471-480: tens digit 7, 10 numbers\n- 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 numbers\n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 9. Because 481-488 is 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 8 numbers, not 9. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488. Therefore, in 401-488, tens digit 8 appears 8 times. So, total tens digit 8 in 1-488 is 40 (from 1-400) +8=48. So, the per-digit analysis is correct, and the earlier count was wrong because I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, but it's actually 8 numbers. Wait, 480 is included, right? 480 is the first number in that set, so 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers. Wait, 488 -480 +1=9. So, 480 is the first, 488 is the ninth. So, that's 9 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. So, that would make the total tens digit 8's: 40 +9=49. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, 480 is included in the 401-488 range, right? So, 480 is part of 401-488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. Therefore, the per-digit analysis was wrong because it only counted 8 numbers, but it's actually 9. So, the correct count is 49 eights in the tens place. So, I think my initial count was correct with 49 eights in the tens place. Therefore, the per-digit analysis must have an error. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the per-digit analysis. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears in a particular position is to use the formula:\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated by:\n\n- Divide the number by 10^position, take the floor, and multiply by 10^position.\n- Then, add the remainder if it's greater than d.\n- Subtract if the digit is higher than d.\n\nWait, maybe that's too formulaic. Alternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nFor the tens place, the number of times 8 appears can be calculated as follows:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). So, for 400 pages, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the 80-89 range in 401-488 is 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences. Therefore, total eights in the tens place:40 +9=49. So, that's correct. Therefore, the initial count was correct with 49 eights in the tens place. So, the per-digit analysis earlier was incorrect because I miscalculated the number of times 8 appears in the last partial hundred. So, the correct count is 49 eights in the tens place. Therefore, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. So, 98 eights in total. And 4's:188. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). This results in 49 occurrences (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all page numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nAdding these together: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 '4's**.\n\n**Counting the number of '8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). This results in 49 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 occurrences, and the last range contributes 9 (since the book ends at 488). This totals 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nAdding these together: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98 '8's**.\n\n**Difference:**\n\nSubtracting the number of '8's from the number of '4's: 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should think about it differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should count the number of 4's and 8's in each position for all page numbers up to 488. Let's try that approach. For units digit: For 4's, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so total occurrences: floor(488/10) =48 full tens, and then check if the last partial ten has a 4. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But since 488 is included, and 488 has 8 in units, so the last 4 in units is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units digit:49. Similarly for 8's: units digit. Same logic: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 ends with 8, it's the 49th occurrence. So, units digit:49 for both. Now, tens digit: For 4's, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100:10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, 401-500:10. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 401-488. So, in 401-488, how many numbers have 4 in tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and then 450-488 don't have 4 in tens place. So, total tens digit 4's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) =4*10=40, plus 10 from 440-449, total 50. So, tens digit 4's:50. For 8's in tens place: Similarly, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total tens digit 8's:4*10 +9=49. So, tens digit 8's:49. Hundreds digit: For 4's, numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place. So, hundreds digit 4's:89. For 8's, hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0. So, total 4's: units(49)+tens(50)+hundreds(89)=188. Total 8's: units(49)+tens(49)+hundreds(0)=98. So, 188-98=90.

For example, let's say a book with 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's? Pages 1-20. 4's: units place:4,14 (2), tens place:40-49 but since only up to 20, no tens place 4's. Hundreds place: none.

Correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's:\n- The tens digit is 4 in blocks of 100. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. There are 488//100=4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, but in the 400s, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers (400-409). Wait, but 400-409 is 10 numbers, but our range is 401-488, so 400 is included? Wait, no, 400 is part of the hundreds. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating. Alternatively, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is the same as the number of complete groups of 100, each contributing 10 fours, plus any partial group. So, 488//100=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (from 401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place in these 88 numbers? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, but since 488 is less than 409? Wait, no, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place fours:4*10 +10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nSame approach for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n- 488//10=48 full cycles, each contributing 1 eight. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n- 488//100=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place (80-89 in each hundred). So, 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nThus, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Another way to check: Let me think about the number of digits. Each page number from 1 to 488. The total number of digits can be calculated, but maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe I can think of each digit place separately. For the hundreds place, only numbers from 100-488 have a hundreds digit. So, 100-488: 489 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4. So, for 4 in the hundreds place, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as I had before. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. Similarly, for 8 in hundreds place, it's 0, since 800 is beyond 488. So, that's correct. For the tens place, each hundred has a 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so for 4 in tens place, 5 sets (1-499, but our book is up to 488, so 440-449 is the last set). So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. For 8 in the tens place, each hundred has 80-89, which is 10 numbers. How many hundreds are there? From 0-488, so 0-488 is 489 numbers, which is 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, there's an 80-89, so 4 sets of 10, which is 40. But wait, in the 400-488 range, does the tens digit ever reach 8? Yes, 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. That's correct. So, 49 eights in tens place. Similarly, for units place, 4 and 8 each appear 49 times. So, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, the answer should be 90. I think that's correct.

For example, in the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N is given by floor(N/10) + (1 if the units digit is >=d else 0). Wait, but maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, for each digit position, we can compute the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Let me try that for the units place again. Units place for 4: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. The first is 4, then 14, 24,...,484. The last number is 484. The number of such numbers is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly for 8: from 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for 4: The tens digit is 4 in numbers from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many complete blocks are there? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40+10=50. Correct. For 8 in the tens place: similar approach. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc., so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: For 4, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. For 8, since 800 is beyond 488, it's 0. So, that's correct. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+49+0=98.

For the units place, the number of times a digit d appears is floor(n/10) + (1 if the remainder is >=d else 0). But wait, that might not be accurate. Let me recall the formula for counting digit occurrences. For each digit position, the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated by:\n\n- Let's say we're looking at the k-th digit (units=1, tens=2, hundreds=3). The formula is:\n\ncount = (n / (10^k)) * 10^(k-1) + extra, where extra depends on the remainder.\n\nBut maybe it's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I can think in terms of how many complete groups of 10, 100, etc., there are.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the units place for 4's. Let me check again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have a 4 in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers: 14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 +10(n-1)=484. Solving for n: 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, for 4's: each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188 fours.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10=488. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just think again if I've considered all the numbers correctly. For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, does 400-488 include 89 numbers? Let's see: 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 4's, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct.\n\nIn the units place for 4's, 484 is the last number with a 4 in the units place, which is correct because 485 would be 485, which doesn't have a 4 in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the last number in the tens place is 488, which is part of the 480-488 block, contributing 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights in the tens place from this block. Correct.\n\nI think I've accounted for all the cases correctly. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should think about another way to calculate it. Alternatively, for each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. Let me try that approach for units, tens, and hundreds. For units digit: numbers from 0 to 487 (since 488 is included, but let me see). Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units digit: For each complete set of 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once. So, up to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 /10 =48 complete sets, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488). In each complete set, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once more (at 484). So, total units digit 4's:48 +1=49. Similarly, for 8's in units place: each complete set has one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers, 488 has an 8, so 48 +1=49. So, that's correct. For tens digit: Each complete set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, etc.), so 48 complete sets would have 48*10=480. But wait, 488 is less than 480*10, so maybe that's not the right way. Wait, actually, the number of times the tens digit is 4 is determined by how many hundreds we have. Let me think again. For the tens digit being 4, it occurs in 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these is a block of 10 numbers, and each block occurs once per hundred. So, up to 488, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10)\n100-199:140-149 (10)\n200-299:240-249 (10)\n300-399:340-349 (10)\n400-488:440-449 (10) and then 450-488 doesn't have another 4 in the tens place. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place: blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each block except the last has 10 numbers, the last has 9 (since 488 is the last page). So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9: 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. For hundreds digit: For 4's, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. For 8's, it's 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, 0. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89)=188. Total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, I think that's correct.

    "text": " Another way to check: Let me think about the total number of digits. The book has 488 pages, so the total number of digits can be calculated, but maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the number of 4's and 8's in each position again. Wait, another way: For units place, 4's: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 ends with 8, does that mean 48 full cycles, so 48 fours, but since 488 is included, and 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4, so actually, 48 fours in units place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me clarify. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as floor(N/10) + (1 if the units digit is >= the target digit else 0). Wait, actually, no. The formula is: For units digit, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if N mod 10 >= d else 0). Wait, but in our case, we're starting from 1, so maybe it's similar. Let me test with N=488. For digit 4 in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10=8 >=4, so we add 1, making it 49. So, 49 fours in units place. That's correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod10=8 >=8, so add 1, total 49. So, that's correct. For tens place: The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to N can be calculated as follows: Let\u2019s consider the higher part and the lower part. For example, for N=488, the tens digit is 8, and the hundreds digit is 4. For digit 4 in tens place: The higher part is 4 (since hundreds digit is 4), and the lower part is 88. The number of times 4 appears in tens place is (higher part) * 10 + (if the current tens digit >4, add 10, else if ==4, add (lower part +1)). Wait, this might be more complicated. Alternatively, let me think of it as each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), 400-488:440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 fours in tens place. Similarly, for 8's in tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct. For hundreds place: For 4's, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. For 8's, since 800 is beyond 488, there are 0. So, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Total 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

But wait, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's an extra 4. So, 48 +1=49. Correct. Similarly, for the tens place: For each complete set of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, how many complete hundreds are there? From 1-400, that's 4 complete hundreds. Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is beyond 449, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50. Correct. For the hundreds place: From 1-400, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct. Similarly, for 8's: Units place: same logic, 49. Tens place: From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each 100 numbers has 10 instances (e.g., 80-89). From 1-400, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. There are 4 complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and an incomplete block 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can think of it another way. Let me consider each digit place separately and make sure I didn't miss anything. For the 4's: Units: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens: Each hundred block has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. From 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units: 8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, I think that's correct.
