So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299:280-289 is 10. 300-399:380-389 is 10.

So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units place:49, tens:49, so 98 eights in total.\n\nWait, earlier I thought units place had 49, but let me confirm. From 8,18,...,488. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, which is 8=8*1, then 18=8*2 + 2? Wait, no, better to think of it as an arithmetic sequence starting at 8, with a common difference of 10, up to 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488. So, 8 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264480 \u2192 n-1 \u226448 \u2192 n \u226449. So, 49 terms. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: as above, 49. So, total eights:98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49, tens 49, so 98 eights. So, now, fours were 188, eights 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. Then tens place:50, units:49, so total fours 188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again for eights in the tens place. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Units place is also 49, so total 98. So, yes, 98 eights. Fours:188, so 188-98=90.

The sequence starts at 4 and ends at 484. The number of terms is calculated as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 48.4, which rounds up to 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. This range includes 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   \n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). The sequence starts at 8 and ends at 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences. Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check again for the tens place in eights. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 in tens place, and 49 in units place, total 98. So, yes, 98 eights.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488 inclusive. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for fours, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nUnits place for fours: 4,14,...,484. Let's see, 484 is the last one. How many terms? From 0 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 terms. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188 fours. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is 488, so how many terms? (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, and the last set is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, 49+49=98 eights.\n\nTherefore, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to determine how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8 since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.

So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Units place:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when counting fours, I had 188 fours, and eights are 98. So, the difference would be 188 -98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the eights again.\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. So, starting at 8, each step of 10. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10=488. So, n-1=(488-8)/10=480/10=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:0. So, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nNow, fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours.\n\nDifference:188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Correct.\n\nUnits place for fours:4,14,...,484. 484 is the last one. So, how many terms? (484-4)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. Difference:90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought of the hundreds place for fours as 400-488, which is 89 numbers, but when I think about it, 400 is the first, 401, ..., up to 488. So, 89 numbers. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: for each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula for each digit position.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor((N +1)/10) if d is 0, else floor(N/10) +1 if d <= (N mod 10), else floor(N/10).\n\nWait, maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, for units digit, for each digit d (0-9), the count is (N+1)//10 if d=0, else (N+1)//10.\n\nWait, no, maybe a better approach is:\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place from 1 to N is:\n\ncount = (N // 10) * 1 + min(d, N % 10)\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think that for each complete group of 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for N=488, the number of complete groups is 48 (since 488//10=48), and then the remainder is 8. So, for digit 4 in units place: count = 48 *1 + (if 4 <=8, then 1 else 0). So, 48 +1=49. Similarly for digit 8: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but that's the same as I had before, so 49 fours and 49 eights in units place.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nSimilarly, each digit d appears 10 times in each group of 100 numbers. So, for N=488, the number of complete groups of 100 is 4 (since 488//100=4), and the remainder is 88.\n\nFor digit d in tens place:\n\ncount = 4 *10 + (if d <=8, then (88//10 +1) else (88//10 + (d <= (88%10)) ? 1 :0))\n\nWait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, for the tens digit, the number of times d appears is:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10 + (if d < (N // 10) % 10, then 10 else (if d == (N // 10) %10, then (N %10) +1 else 0))\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. For the tens place:\n\n- For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, digit d appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for N=488, the hundreds part is 4, so the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in tens place:\n\n- Complete hundreds: 4 (from 0-399). Each contributes 10 fours in tens place: 4*10=40.\n\n- In the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 0-8. So, does 4 appear in the tens place? Yes, in 440-449. So, how many numbers? 10, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total for tens place:40+10=50. Which matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in tens place:\n\n- Complete hundreds:4, each contributes 10 eights in tens place:4*10=40.\n\n- In the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 has tens digit 8). So, does 8 appear in the tens place in this last partial hundred? Yes, in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place:40+9=49. Which matches my earlier count.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\n- For digit 4, it appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n- For digit 8, it doesn't appear in hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit is 4 or less. So, 0 eights.\n\nSo, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) =188.\n\nTotal eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

The tens place being 8 occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers.

For example, in 80-89, that's 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189:10, etc. But for 480-488, it's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

    "text": " Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When counting the tens place, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block which is only up to 488. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. That matches. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place had 49 eights, and tens place had 49, so total 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers.\n- Tens: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 5*10=50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=48+1=49.\n- Tens:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10, the last has 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n- Hundreds: none, since 800>488.\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nAnd for 8's in the hundreds place, since 800 is beyond 488, there are none.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my earlier calculation is correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This range includes 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me go through it again.\n\nCounting fours:\n\n- Units place: from 4,14,24,...,484. The last number is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1)=484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 fours in units.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50 fours in tens.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, eights:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. Let's see, 488 is included. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 +10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in units.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, as before.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nThus, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe in the hundreds place for fours, it's 89, but maybe I should check if 488 is included correctly.\n\nYes, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: for the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers.

When I counted units place fours, I went up to 484, which is 484. So, from 4,14,...,484. How many terms is that?

Correct.\n\nTens place for fours: from 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nTens place for eights: from 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. First four blocks have 10 each, last block has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for fours: 400-488. That's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for eights: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.

Units place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. 484 is 484, which is 48*10 +4, so 49 numbers. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. So, 98 eights. 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms (484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last block (480-488) has 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, each block contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
