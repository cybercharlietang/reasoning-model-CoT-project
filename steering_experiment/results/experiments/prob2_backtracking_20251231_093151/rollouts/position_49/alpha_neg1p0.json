    "text": " So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the units place for fours. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, 488 is included, so the last group is 480-488, which includes 484 as the last 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 fours from 4,14,...,484, which is 49 numbers because 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488/10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, 488 is included, so from 1-488, the number of numbers ending with 4 is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 >=4. Wait, 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, plus 1 because 4 is included, so 49 fours in the units place. So, that part is correct. Similarly, for the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. That's correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights, units place: same logic, 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9, so 49 eights. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) -98 (eights) =90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right.

Wait, but in my count, I counted units and tens separately, so 1's in units: 2, 1's in tens:10, total 12. 2's in units:2,2's in tens:1, total 3. So, 12-3=9, which is correct.

In the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Yes, because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So that's correct. Similarly, in the units place for fours, I had 484 as the last one, which is the 49th occurrence, but wait, when I calculated units place for fours, I thought it was 49, but when I did the same for eights, it was 49 as well. Wait, but 484 is the 49th four in the units place, but for eights, the last is 488, which is the 49th eight in the units place. So that seems consistent. For the tens place, fours had 50 occurrences, because 40-49,140-149, etc., each giving 10, and 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But for eights, the last set is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers, so that's why it's 49. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, so the difference is 90.

Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Yep, that's correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, we subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\quad \\text{(but since 484 is included, we add 1)}  \n     \\Rightarrow 49 \\text{ fours}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours in the tens place.  \n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Total fours:  \n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50 \\text{ fours}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\text{ fours}\n     \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188 \\text{ fours}\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\quad \\text{(but since 488 is included, we add 1)}  \n     \\Rightarrow 49 \\text{ eights}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block.  \n   - Number of blocks: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).  \n   - The last block (480-488) has 9 numbers.  \n   - Total eights:  \n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\text{ eights}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98 \\text{ eights}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating the difference:**  \n\\[\n188 \\, (\\text{fours}) - 98 \\, (\\text{eights}) = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"
