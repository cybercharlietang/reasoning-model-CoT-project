So, total eights in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9 (since 488 is the last page). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 in tens place. Units and tens: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, so the last set is 9 numbers, not 10. So total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 in 480-488. So total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 =98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights) =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For units place, fours: from 4,14,...,484: that's 49 numbers. Eights: from 8,18,...,488: that's 49 numbers. For tens place, fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49. Hundreds place: fours: 400-488: 89 numbers, eights: none. So, fours total:49+50+89=188. Eights total:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. Yep, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). This results in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in the range 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488), resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.

    "text": " Wait, is that right? From 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) each have 10, and the last set has 9. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place eights:0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Wait, that can't be right because 49+49 is 98, but let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98 eights. But wait, when I was counting the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. So total eights:49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, as 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: Units place:8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90.
