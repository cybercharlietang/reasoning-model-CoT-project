    "text": " So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm thinking, is 90 the correct answer? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should check by looking at each digit position again. Alternatively, perhaps I can write a small table to count the occurrences. For 4's: Units: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? As before, 49. Tens: numbers where the tens digit is 4. Each hundred block has 10 such numbers, and there are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 only up to 449, right? Wait, no, actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and then 450-488 would have tens digits 5-8, so only 440-449 have tens digit 4. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, total tens digits with 4: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds digit: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units digit: same as before, 49. Tens digit: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a large number. Let me think differently. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again, but perhaps I missed something. Let me check the units digit for 4's: numbers ending with 4 from 4 to 484. The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1 = floor(484/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. For 8's: numbers ending with 8 from 8 to 488. Same calculation: floor((488-8)/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens digit for 4's: each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. There are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. Correct. Tens digit for 8's: same logic, 5 hundreds, each contributing 10, but in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9: 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds digit for 4's: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. Hundreds digit for 8's: none. So, 0. So, 4's total:188, 8's total:98. Difference:90. So, I think that's correct.

Because 480 is the first, then 481,...,488. So, 488-480+1=9. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, 49 in tens place. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.

And for the tens place, 5 sets of 10, so 50. Units place, 49. So, 188 fours. For 8's, units and tens each have 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90.
