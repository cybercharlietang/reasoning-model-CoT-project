When I counted the units place for 4's, I included 484, which is correct because 484 is within 488. Similarly, for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). So, yes, that seems right.

    "text": " So, 188 -98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? Sometimes when counting, it's easy to miss a number or count an extra. Let me try another approach for the units place of 4's and 8's. For units place of 4: The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly for 8's: 8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. For the tens place of 4's: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so 40-49,140-149, etc. Up to 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. For the tens place of 8's: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four sets have 10 each, the last set has 9. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Hundreds place for 8's: 0. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, yes, I think that's correct.

Yes, because 440-449 is within 488. Similarly, for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct. So, yes, 90 seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of another way to count. For example, for each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. But I think I did that already. Alternatively, maybe I can write out the counts more systematically. For 4's: Units place: From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in units place? It's floor(488/10)=48 full decades, and then check if the last partial decade includes a 4. 488/10=48.8, so the 49th occurrence is at 484. So, 49 times. Tens place: For each hundred, there's a block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, in 1-100: 40-49 (10), 101-200:140-149 (10), 201-300:240-249 (10), 301-400:340-349 (10), 401-488:440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For a three-digit number, each position (units, tens, hundreds) can be considered separately. Let's see:\n\nFor units place:\n- For 4: It appears once every 10 numbers. Total numbers:488. So, 488 /10=48.8, which we take the integer part, but since we include the last occurrence, it's 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8: 488 /10=48.8, so 49.\n\nWait, but that's only for units place. But when I did it earlier, for 4's in units place, I got 49, and for 8's, also 49. So that's correct.\n\nFor tens place:\n- For 4: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, 4 hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so how does that affect the tens place? Actually, in the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers with tens digit 4, except the last block if it's cut short. Wait, but in our case, from 0-488, the hundreds are 0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. In the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10. So, total tens places with 4:5*10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n- Each hundred block has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, except the last block if it's cut short. So, 0-99:80-89 (10), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488 (9). So, total tens places with 8:4*10 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n- For 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n- For 8: There are no hundreds with 8 in 1-488, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n- 4's: units(49) + tens(50) + hundreds(89)=188\n- 8's: units(49) + tens(49) + hundreds(0)=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that confirms my earlier calculation.

Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

To find the count:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of terms} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, there are 49 fours in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of fours} = 5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n   So, there are 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. The count is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of terms} = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n   So, there are 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n\\[\n49 \\ (\\text{units}) + 50 \\ (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\ (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

The count is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of terms} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\quad \\text{plus 1 for the starting term} = 49\n   \\]\n   So, there are 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers, specifically in the range 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block contributes 10 eights, except the last block which contributes 9 eights (since the book ends at 488):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of eights} = 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, there are 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.
