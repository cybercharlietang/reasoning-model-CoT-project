    "text": " So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility I double-counted any numbers? For example, in the tens place, when counting 440-449, those numbers are also in the hundreds place as 400-488. But I think that's okay because each digit position is counted separately. So, 444 would have a 4 in hundreds, tens, and units, but each occurrence is counted in their respective digit positions. So, the total count is accurate. Alternatively, maybe I should check a smaller range to see if my counting method works. Let's say a book with 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's? Page numbers 1-20. 4's: 4,14 (units) and 40-49 but wait, 20 is less than 40, so only units: 4 and 14, so 2 fours. 8's: 8,18 (units), and 80-89 but beyond 20, so only 8 and 18, so 2 eights. So, 2-2=0. Let me apply my method: units place: 4,14 => 2. Tens place: 40-49 but beyond 20, so 0. Hundreds place: 0. Total 4's:2. Units place for 8's:8,18 =>2. Tens place:80-89 beyond 20, so 0. Hundreds:0. Total 8's:2. So, difference is 0, which is correct. So, my method works here. Another test: 100 pages. 4's: units:10 (4,14,...,94), tens:10 (40-49), hundreds:0 (since 100 is 100, but 100 has a 1 in hundreds, so 0). Wait, no, 100 is page 100, which is included. So, hundreds place for 4's would be 400-499, but in 100 pages, it's 0. So, total 4's:10+10=20. 8's: units:10 (8,18,...,98), tens:10 (80-89), hundreds:0. So, 10+10=20. Difference 0. But wait, in reality, 100 pages: 4's: units:10, tens:10, hundreds:0. 8's: same. So, correct. Now, let me check 488 again. I think my count is correct.
