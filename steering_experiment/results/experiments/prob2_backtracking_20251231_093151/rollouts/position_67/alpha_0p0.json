Correct. - Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds place: none. So, 49+49=98. Thus, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. Maybe I should double-check with another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For the units place: for 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in units place is floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 has 8 in units, which is greater than 4, so add 1. So, 48+1=49. Same as before. Similarly, for 8 in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and since last digit is 8, which is equal to 8, so add 1. So, 48+1=49. Correct. For the tens place: 4 appears in tens place in each block of 100. So, in 1-100, 40-49:10 times. Similarly, 101-200:140-149:10, and so on up to 400-488. How many complete hundreds are there? 400-488 is part of the 400-499 block, but we only go up to 488. So, how many complete hundreds? From 1-400, that's 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours:40+10=50. Correct. For 8 in tens place: Similarly, in each block of 100, 80-89 is 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights:4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total eights in tens place:40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: For 4, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For 8, it's 800-899, but we only go up to 488, so 0 eights. So, total fours:49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188. Eights:49(units)+49(tens)+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. Yep, that seems consistent.

Correct. - Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds: 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in the range 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's minus number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: - Units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. - Tens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 8's would have some numbers, but no, since the book only goes up to 488, so 800-899 isn't included. So, yeah, 0 in the hundreds place for 8's. So, the difference is 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit from the right):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). This sequence has 49 terms (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit from the right):** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 instances.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit from the right):** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). This sequence has 49 terms (from 8 to 488, inclusive).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers (since the book ends at 488). Total: 49 instances.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is '8' because the book ends at 488.\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
