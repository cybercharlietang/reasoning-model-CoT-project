The last one is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, how many? The first term is 8, last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. - Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188 fours and 98 eights. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but I'm thinking, is 90 the correct answer? Let me see. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, 488 -400 +1=89. So, that's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. Difference is 90. Hmm, I think that's correct.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That seems right because 488-400=88, but since we include both endpoints, it's 89. Similarly, for the tens place in the 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, all counts seem accurate.

Hmm, but wait, let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct. For the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds for 8's, total 98. 4's:188. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think about another approach to confirm. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately again. Alternatively, maybe I can think of each digit position separately and see if the counts are correct. Let's try that. For 4's: - Units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 4 at 484. So, 48 +1=49. Correct. - Tens place: how many times does 4 appear in the tens digit? It's 10 times every 100 numbers. So, 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many hundreds are there? From 0-488, so 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). In each hundred, except the last, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. So, 0-99:40-49 (10), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), and 400-488:440-449 (10). So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct. - Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: - Units place: same as 4's, every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, plus one more at 488, so 49. Correct. - Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds place: none, so 0.
