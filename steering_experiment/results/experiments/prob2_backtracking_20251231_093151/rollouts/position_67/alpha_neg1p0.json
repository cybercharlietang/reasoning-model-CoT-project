Another way to think about it: For units place, 4's: from 4 to 484, that's (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly for 8's: from 8 to 488, same calculation: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each 10 numbers, 5 sets, 50. Correct.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me think again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That seems correct. So, the difference is 90. But wait, I'm a bit confused because when I think about the tens place for 4's, up to 449, which is within 488, so that's correct. Hmm, maybe the answer is 90. But let me check another way. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately. Let me try that again.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits place: For each page number from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, how many complete cycles of 10 are there? 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48*1=48. But then, in the last partial cycle, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So, total units place 4's:48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, each 100 numbers have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many hundreds are there? 488 is less than 500, so we have 400-499, but our book ends at 488. So, the number of hundreds is 4 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers with tens digit 4, except maybe the last one.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n- 0-99: 40-49:10 numbers\n- 100-199:140-149:10\n- 200-299:240-249:10\n- 300-399:340-349:10\n- 400-488:440-449:10 (since 440-449 is within 488)\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, but let's see. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers:8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place: Now, for the tens digit being 8, the numbers are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, no numbers from 800-899, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me verify the hundreds place for 4's again. From page 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. The difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** \n     - Occurs every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n     - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 48.4 \u2192 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):**\n     - Occurs in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n     - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n     - Total blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):**\n     - Occurs in pages 400-488.\n     - Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):**\n     - Occurs every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):**\n     - Occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n     - Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last block.\n     - Blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n     - Occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):**\n     - No pages in 800-899, so 0.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. Now, the 8's: - Units:49, correct. - Tens:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but wait a minute, in the hundreds place for 8's, I thought there are none, which is correct because 800 is beyond 488. So, yes, 98 eights. So, the difference is 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe I missed something. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position again to confirm. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a different approach. Let me try another way. For the units digit: In each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. So, for 488 pages, there are 48 full decades (10 numbers each) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, for units digit: 48 full decades give 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units digit: 48+1=49 fours, 48+1=49 eights. Now, for the tens digit: In each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly for 8. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40. Similarly, 8 appears 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Let's see when the tens digit is 4: 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8: 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place: fours:40 (from full hundreds) +10=50. Eights:40 (from full hundreds) +9=49. So, total tens digits: fours=50, eights=49. Now, hundreds digit: For 4's, in the hundreds place, 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers (as before), so 89 fours. For 8's, hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0 eights. So, adding up: fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188. Eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98. So, 188-98=90. So, I think my initial calculation was correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
