    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should understand the problem clearly. The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488, and each page number is printed once. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then count how many times the digit 8 appears. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll need to consider all three places: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI think the best approach is to break down the problem by each digit place separately. That is, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place, then in the tens place, and then in the hundreds place across all page numbers from 1 to 488. Once I have those counts, I can sum them up for each digit and then find the difference.\n\nLet's tackle the units place first. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers, except possibly for the last set if the total number isn't a multiple of 10. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then an extra 8 numbers.\n\nIn each complete set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once (8, 18, 28, etc.). So, for each set of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place.\n\nThere are 48 complete sets of 10 in 480 pages. So, for the units place, the count for 4 is 48, and the count for 8 is also 48.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488). The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in this partial set, the digit 4 appears once (484), and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the units place counts become 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because 481 to 488 is 8 numbers, and the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, the units place counts are 49 for both 4 and 8. Hmm, but wait, 480 is the last page of the 48th set, so 481 to 488 is 8 pages, so the units digits are 1 to 8. So, yes, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. But since we're going up to 488, it's a bit more involved.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for 400 pages, that would be 4 times 100, so 40 times each digit in the tens place. But since we're only going up to 488, which is 88 pages beyond 400, we need to adjust.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 every 100 pages. So, for each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for 400 pages, that's 4 hundreds, so 40 times each digit in the tens place. But from 401 to 488, that's 88 pages, so the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is in the 80s tens place). So, in the tens place, from 401 to 488, the digits 0 to 8 each appear 9 times (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8, but wait, 480 to 489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, and digits 0 to 7 each appear 9 times as well? Wait, no, let me check.\n\nActually, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go through 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 9 times because each group of 10 (like 400-409, 410-419, etc.) has 10 numbers, but since we're starting at 401, the first group is 401-410, which is 10 numbers, then 411-420, etc., up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that from 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles 4 complete times (each 100 pages) plus an additional 88 pages.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in the tens place from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each 100 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) contribute 4 * 10 = 40 times each digit in the tens place.\n\nThen, from 401 to 488, that's 88 numbers. The tens digits in this range go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place here?\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488 \u2192 8 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in this range.\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488:\n\n- Digits 0-7 each appear 10 times\n- Digit 8 appears 8 times\n\nTherefore, the total count for each digit in the tens place from 1-488 is:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-480) = 50 times each\n- Digit 8: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48 times\n- Digit 9: 40 times (since we don't reach 490-499)\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 490, so digit 9 in the tens place doesn't appear at all beyond 400. So, digits 0-8 in the tens place from 401-488 are as I mentioned.\n\nWait, but let me check again. From 401-488, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 \u2192 8 numbers\n\nSo, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place from 401-488, digit 8 appears 8 times, while digits 0-7 each appear 10 times.\n\nSo, adding to the counts from 1-400:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-480) = 50 each\n- For digit 8: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n- Digit 9: 40 times (from 1-400, as 490-499 isn't included)\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 490, so in the 401-488 range, the tens digit never reaches 9, so digit 9 in the tens place only appears in the 1-400 range, which is 40 times.\n\nBut wait, I'm only concerned with digits 4 and 8, so let me focus on those.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: from 1-400, it appears 40 times (since each hundred contributes 10 times, and 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40). From 401-488, digit 4 in the tens place appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So total for digit 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n- Digit 8: from 1-400, it appears 40 times. From 401-488, digit 8 in the tens place appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So total for digit 8 in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 \u2192 99 pages, but since we're only counting digits 4 and 8, 0 doesn't count.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1 \u2192 100 pages, but again, we're only interested in 4 and 8, so 0 times.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2 \u2192 100 pages, same as above, 0 times.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3 \u2192 100 pages, 0 times.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4 \u2192 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive, which is 89 pages because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nWait, 400 to 488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about digit 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The highest is 4, so digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4: 89 times\n- Digit 8: 0 times\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences for digits 4 and 8 across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nNow for digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. And 49 + 48 is 97. So, the difference would be 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the counts.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1-488, each digit 0-9 appears in the units place equally, except possibly the last partial set. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, each digit appears 48 times in the units place, plus once in the last 8 numbers if the digit is \u22648. So, digits 1-8 appear 49 times each, and 9 and 0 appear 48 times. Wait, but 0 appears in the units place for numbers like 10, 20, etc., but in the first 488 numbers, 0 appears 48 times (once every 10 numbers). But in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 0 doesn't appear there. So, 0 appears 48 times, and digits 1-8 appear 49 times each. So, units place for 4 and 8 is 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. From 401-488, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and digit 8 appears 8 times. So, for digit 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. For digit 8: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nDigit 4 appears 89 times (400-488), digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those. So, 89 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place (481-488). So, 8 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the tens place from 401-488, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and digit 8 appears 8 times. So, for digit 8 in the tens place, it's 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 4 in the tens place, from 1-400, it's 40 times, and from 401-488, it's 10 times (441-450), so 50 total.\n\nUnits place: 49 each for 4 and 8.\n\nSo, yes, the total counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the hundreds place again. 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each, so that's 89 times. Correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in each place?\n\nUnits: As calculated, 49.\n\nTens: 50.\n\nHundreds: 89.\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8:\n\nUnits: 49.\n\nTens: 48.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal: 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, I think I've double-checked all the steps, and the calculations seem correct. Therefore, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - In the last 8 pages (481-488), digits 1-8 each appear once.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - For the first 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times.\n   - From 401-488, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have the hundreds digit as 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page has a number from 1 to 488, and each digit in these numbers can be a 4 or an 8. I need to count how many times each digit appears in all the page numbers and then find the difference between the counts of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me start by considering how numbers are formed. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers since 488 is a three-digit number. So, I should break down the counting based on the number of digits.\n\n1-digit page numbers: These are from 1 to 9. So, how many 4's and 8's are there here? Well, each digit from 1 to 9 appears exactly once. So, there's one 4 and one 8 in the 1-digit page numbers.\n\n2-digit page numbers: These are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nStarting with the tens place:\n- For the tens digit, 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times.\n- Similarly, 8 appears in 80-89, which is another 10 times.\n\nNow, the units place:\n- For the units digit, 4 appears once in every ten numbers, like 14, 24, ..., 94. That's 9 times.\n- Similarly, 8 appears once in every ten numbers, like 18, 28, ..., 98. That's 9 times.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, we've already counted the 4 and 8 in 40-49 and 80-89, so when we count the units place, we don't have to worry about double-counting because we're considering separate places.\n\nSo, for 2-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Similarly, the total number of 8's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but hold on, when we're looking at the units place for 4's, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, so 90/10 = 9 times for each digit. So, yeah, 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to 3-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because we have hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nLet's break it down by each digit place.\n\nHundreds place:\n- The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since 488 is the last page, the hundreds digit goes up to 4.\n- 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many times? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, 0 times.\n\nTens place:\n- Now, for the tens digit in 3-digit numbers, we need to consider each hundred separately, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nFor each hundred block:\n- In each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers.\n- So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), same for 8.\n\nBut wait, for the 400-488 block, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times (440-449), and for 8, it's 10 times (480-489), but since we only go up to 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers. Hmm, so I need to adjust that.\n\nWait, let me clarify. For the tens place in 400-488:\n- The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, 4 appears once as 440-449, which is 10 numbers. 8 appears as 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for 400-488.\n\nSo, putting it all together for the tens place:\n- For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: Each has 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place. So, that's 3 hundreds blocks, each contributing 10 for 4 and 10 for 8. So, 3*10 = 30 for 4 and 30 for 8.\n\nFor 400-488: 10 times 4 and 9 times 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n- 4's: 30 + 10 = 40\n- 8's: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nUnits place:\n- Now, for the units digit in 3-digit numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each position, except perhaps in the last block if the total number isn't a multiple of 10.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds blocks.\n\nFor 100-199, 200-299, 300-399:\n- Each hundred has 100 numbers, so each digit (0-9) appears 10 times in the units place. So, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times in each block. So, for 3 blocks, that's 3*10 = 30 for 4 and 30 for 8.\n\nFor 400-488:\n- There are 89 numbers here (from 400 to 488 inclusive). The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. Since 89 divided by 10 is 8 full cycles (80 numbers) and 9 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each full cycle of 10, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once. So, for 8 full cycles, that's 8 times each. Then, in the remaining 9 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). \n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total in 400-488:\n\n- 4's in units place: 8 (from full cycles) + 1 (from partial) = 9\n- 8's in units place: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nSo, total for units place:\n- 4's: 30 + 9 = 39\n- 8's: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because 488 is the last page, but let me check again.\n\nWait, in 400-488, the units digits go from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, for each ten, like 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-488. So, each ten has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9. So, for the units digit, in each full ten, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, in 400-480, that's 8 full tens (400-409 up to 470-479), each contributing 1 to 4 and 8 in units place. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, units digits 0-8. So, in that partial ten, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n\nSo, total in 400-488 for units place:\n- 4's: 8 (from full tens) + 1 (from partial) = 9\n- 8's: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nSo, total units place:\n- 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 = 39\n- 8's: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits for 3-digit numbers.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 40\n- 8's: 39\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 39\n- 8's: 39\n\nSo, total for 3-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n- 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check.\n\nWait, 89 in hundreds place for 4's, that's correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nFor tens place, 40 for 4's and 39 for 8's. That seems correct because in 400-488, the tens digit for 4's is 10 times (440-449), and for 8's, it's 9 times (480-488). So, 10 + 30 (from the other hundreds) for 4's, which is 40, and 9 + 30 for 8's, which is 39.\n\nUnits place, as calculated, is 39 each.\n\nSo, 4's in 3-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n8's in 3-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nNow, let's add up all the digits from 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers.\n\n1-digit:\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\n2-digit:\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\n3-digit:\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, 1-digit: 1 each.\n\n2-digit: For 4's, tens place 10 (40-49) and units place 9 (14,24,...,94) = 19.\n\nSame for 8's: tens place 10 (80-89) and units place 9 (18,28,...,98) = 19.\n\n3-digit:\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (440-449) = 40\n- 8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (480-488) = 39\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n- 8's: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nSo, 4's in 3-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n8's in 3-digit: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 168 (3-digit) = 188\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check if I missed something.\n\nWait, in the 3-digit numbers, the hundreds place for 4's is 89, which is correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, in 100-399, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 3*10=30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 30 + 10 = 40 for 4's in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place, in 100-399, each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: For 4's, in 100-399, each hundred has 10 numbers where units digit is 4, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, units digit 4 occurs once every 10 numbers. Since 488 is the last page, we have 8 full tens (400-409 up to 470-479) and then 480-488. In each full ten, units digit 4 occurs once, so 8 times. Then in 480-488, units digit 4 occurs once (484). So, total 8 + 1 = 9. So, 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSame for 8's in units place: 30 in 100-399, and in 400-488, 8 occurs once in each full ten (8 times) and once in 488, so 9. So, 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, yes, the counts for 3-digit numbers seem correct.\n\nAdding up all 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nAll 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems like a large number. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately across all page numbers.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\n1-digit numbers (1-9):\n- Units place: 1 each for 4 and 8.\n\n2-digit numbers (10-99):\n- Tens place: 10 each for 4 and 8.\n- Units place: 9 each for 4 and 8.\n\n3-digit numbers (100-488):\n- Hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n- Tens place:\n  - For 4: In each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), 10 times each, so 3*10=30. Plus in 400-488, 10 times (440-449). Total 40.\n  - For 8: In each hundred, 10 times each, so 3*10=30. Plus in 400-488, 9 times (480-488). Total 39.\n- Units place:\n  - For 4: In each hundred, 10 times each, so 3*10=30. Plus in 400-488, 9 times (as calculated before). Total 39.\n  - For 8: Similarly, 3*10=30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:\n- Units: 1 (1-digit) + 9 (2-digit) + 39 (3-digit) = 49\n- Tens: 10 (2-digit) + 40 (3-digit) = 50\n- Hundreds: 0 (1 and 2-digit) + 89 (3-digit) = 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n8's:\n- Units: 1 (1-digit) + 9 (2-digit) + 39 (3-digit) = 49\n- Tens: 10 (2-digit) + 39 (3-digit) = 49\n- Hundreds: 0 (all)\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, same result. So, I think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the structure of the page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to analyze the occurrence of the digits 4 and 8 in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI'll break it down by each digit place separately.\n\n**1. Units Place:**\n\nFor the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the digit 4 will appear once every 10 numbers, and so will the digit 8.\n\nTo find the total number of times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 numbers and then see if there's a partial block left.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place.\n\nLet me calculate:\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10 in 488: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, and a partial block of 8 numbers (since 488 = 48*10 + 8).\n\nIn each complete block, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each.\n\nNow, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nSo, total units place counts:\n\n- 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWait, that's the same. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 488 is the last page, so the last page is 488, so the units digits go up to 8 in the last partial block. So, 481 has units digit 1, 482:2, 483:3, 484:4, 485:5, 486:6, 487:7, 488:8. So, yes, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place of the partial block.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each.\n\n**2. Tens Place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, ..., 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n\nSimilarly, in 101-200, the tens digits go through 0-9 again, each appearing 10 times, and so on.\n\nSo, first, let's figure out how many hundreds are there in 488. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo, for the first 400 pages (4 hundreds), each digit 4 and 8 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, we need to check the remaining 88 pages (401-488) for the tens digits.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nWait, 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit here is 8 for all of them, from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times here.\n\nNow, in the 441-450 range, the tens digit is 4, so that's 10 numbers (441-450), so 4 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, in the 481-488 range, the tens digit is 8, so 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, in the 401-488 range, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (from 441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488).\n\nTherefore, total tens place counts:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 48 times.\n\n**3. Hundreds Place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. How many times does 4 appear here?\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place counts:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\n**4. Total Counts:**\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\n- For 4's:\n  - Units: 49\n  - Tens: 50\n  - Hundreds: 89\n  Total = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n- For 8's:\n  - Units: 49\n  - Tens: 48\n  - Hundreds: 0\n  Total = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 97 = 91, which seems like a big difference. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me go back step by step.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- Each 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 to 4's and 1 to 8's. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, which has units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 for both. Then, in 401-488:\n\n  - The tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\n  - The digit 4 appears in the tens place from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\n  - The digit 8 appears in the tens place from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcounting in the hundreds place. Let me check how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, each of those 89 pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place, since the book doesn't go beyond 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0. Correct.\n\nWait, so the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97, so the difference is indeed 91.\n\nBut let me think again: in the units and tens places, 4's and 8's are similar, but in the hundreds place, 4's have a significant advantage because the book ends at 488, which is in the 400s. So, that would add 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, 4's had an extra 2 (50 vs 48). So, the difference comes mostly from the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the totals:\n\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 91 seems like a large number. Let me try an alternative approach to verify.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nInstead of counting each digit place separately, maybe I can iterate through each page number and count the occurrences, but that would be tedious for 488 pages. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a systematic way.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is:\n\nTotal number of digits printed from 1 to 488.\n\nBut that's not necessary here. Alternatively, I can consider each digit place again but more carefully.\n\nWait, let me check the units place again.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total number of times is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last digit is >=4.\n\nWait, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so floor is 48, and since the last digit is 8, which is >=4, so 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place: same calculation, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in 4 hundreds, 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, total 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: in each hundred, 10 times, so 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred, 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, total 48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times, as from 400-488. 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 4's total 188, 8's total 97, difference is 91.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 488 pages, so page 488 is included. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, correct.\n\nWait, 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's and '8's in Each Digit Place:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n     - Total blocks of 10 in 488: 48 full blocks, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n     - Partial block (481-488): '4' appears once (484), '8' appears once (488).\n     - Total: 49 '4's, 49 '8's.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n     - First 400 pages: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 '4's and 10 '8's \u2192 40 each.\n     - Pages 401-488:\n       - '4' appears 10 times (441-450).\n       - '8' appears 8 times (481-488).\n     - Total: 50 '4's, 48 '8's.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears from 400-488: 89 times.\n     - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n     - Total: 89 '4's, 0 '8's.\n\n2. **Total Counts:**\n   - **'4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **'8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 97 (number of '8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 91 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I need to understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a number from 1 to 488, and I'm supposed to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these numbers and how many times 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are counted in numbers. I think I should break down the problem by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I can analyze each position one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the digit 8 appears once (e.g., 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nHow many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages (481 to 488). In each of these 48 blocks, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nBut wait, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, does the digit 4 appear? Let's see: 484 is within this range, so that's one more 4 in the units place. Similarly, 488 is in this range, so that's one more 8 in the units place. \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from partial block) = 49.\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nHmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, no difference there.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (10 times) and 8 in 80-89 (10 times). \n\nSimilarly, in each subsequent hundred, like 101-200, 201-300, etc., the same pattern repeats. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred (401-488).\n\nIn each of these 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's look at the tens digit in this range:\n\n- From 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers (441 to 450). But wait, 450 is included, and since the book goes up to 488, 450 is within range. So, that's 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears in 481-488, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but our range ends at 488. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480 is included in the range 401-488, so that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers because 480 is the first and 488 is the last. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, 480 is part of the 480-489 range, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50.\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is ahead by 1 here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (if we consider it as three-digit numbers, but actually, page numbers start at 1, so maybe not). Wait, but in reality, page numbers from 1-99 are two-digit numbers, so the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're considering three-digit numbers, perhaps we should include that.\n\nWait, but in the problem, page numbers are from 1 to 488, so pages 1-99 are two-digit numbers, and pages 100-488 are three-digit numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, let's analyze the hundreds digit. We need to see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFirst, 8 in the hundreds place: Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest hundreds digit is 4 (for pages 400-488). Therefore, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nNow, how about 4? The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 across all digit places.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 48 full blocks of 10 (each contributing 1) = 48, plus 484 in the last partial block, so +1 = 49.\n- 8's: 48 full blocks, plus 488 in the last partial block, so +1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 4 full hundreds (each contributing 10) = 40, plus 10 in the partial hundred (441-450) = 50.\n- 8's: 4 full hundreds = 40, plus 9 in the partial hundred (480-488) = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89 (400-488)\n- 8's: 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we find that the digit 4 appears 188 times and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should understand the problem clearly. Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how to count the number of times a specific digit appears in a range of numbers. I remember that this involves looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc., and calculating how often the digit appears in each place.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488. So, the highest digit place I'll need to consider is the hundreds place, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since 488 is the last page, the hundreds digit goes up to 4.\n\nI think the best approach is to break down the counting into each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll do this for both digits 4 and 8 separately and then find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14, and so on.\n   - To find out how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full blocks of 10 and a remainder of 8. So, each block contributes 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place, totaling 48 times. But wait, the remainder is 8, so in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, which includes 484. So, that's one more occurrence. Therefore, total 4's in units place = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 numbers. Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place within each block of 100. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers.\n   - So, for each 100 numbers, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n   - Now, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block (401-488).\n   - Each full block contributes 10 times, so 4 blocks give 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, the partial block is 401-488. The tens digit here cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the end). The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is less than 490, so does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is within 401-488. So, that's another 10 occurrences.\n   - Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more. So total tens place 4's = 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit cycles every 1000 numbers. In this case, our range is up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n   - Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, for the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the tens place, I considered 4 blocks of 100, each giving 10 4's in the tens place, totaling 40, and then the partial block 401-488, which includes 440-449, adding another 10. So 40 +10=50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 488 /10 =48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial block (481-488) which includes 484, so +1, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nWait, but 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, each block of 10 numbers contributes one 8 in the units place.\n   - 488 /10 =48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial block (481-488), which includes 488, so +1. So units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. For example, 80-89 in each 100 block.\n   - So, 488 /100=4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n   - Now, the partial block is 401-488. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So that's 9 occurrences.\n   - So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place from 1 to 488 because the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 8's=49+49=98.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nLet me go through each step again.\n\n**Rechecking 4's:**\n\n- Units place:\n  - 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. The last partial block is 481-488, which includes 484, so +1. Total 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place:\n  - Each 100 numbers contribute 10 4's in the tens place. 4 blocks of 100: 4*10=40.\n  - Partial block 401-488: The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So +10. Total 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - From 400 to 488: 89 numbers. So 89 4's. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\n**Rechecking 8's:**\n\n- Units place:\n  - 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Last partial block 481-488 includes 488, so +1. Total 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place:\n  - Each 100 numbers contribute 10 8's in the tens place. 4 blocks: 4*10=40.\n  - Partial block 401-488: Tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So +9. Total 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 0 occurrences. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the tens place for 8's in the partial block 401-488. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when does the tens digit become 8? It's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 occurrences, not 10, because 488 is the end. So, yes, 9 is correct. So, total 40+9=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10. That's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should understand what the problem is asking. It's about counting the number of times the digit '4' appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and then comparing that to the number of times '8' appears. The difference between these two counts will give me the answer.\n\nAlright, let's start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, I need to analyze the digits in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately for both '4' and '8'.\n\nI think the best approach is to break down the counting based on each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate how many times '4' appears in each position and do the same for '8'. Then, I'll subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, '4' and '8' will each appear once every 10 numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, '4' appears once (at page 4) and '8' appears once (at page 8). This pattern repeats every 10 numbers.\n\nSo, for the units digit, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. Each complete set contributes one '4' and one '8' in the units place. So, for the units digit, the number of '4's is 48 and the number of '8's is also 48. But wait, in the extra 8 numbers (from 481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, in these, '4' appears once (at 484) and '8' appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total for the units digit is 48 + 1 = 49 '4's and 48 + 1 = 49 '8's. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, the units digit doesn't contribute to the difference between '4's and '8's. Let's move on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, '4' and '8' will each appear 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, '4' appears in the tens place from 40 to 49, which is 10 times, and '8' appears from 80 to 89, which is also 10 times.\n\nNow, let's see how many complete hundreds are in 488. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nFor each complete hundred, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place, and '8' also appears 10 times. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 '4's and 4 * 10 = 40 '8's.\n\nNow, looking at the partial hundred from 401 to 488. The tens digit here cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see where '4' and '8' appear in the tens place. \n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, '4' appears when the tens digit is 4, which is from 440 to 449. But wait, in our case, we're starting at 401, so the first time '4' appears in the tens place is at 440-449. However, since 488 is less than 490, we only go up to 488. So, the '4' in the tens place occurs from 440 to 449, which is 10 times, but since 449 is within 488, that's fine. So, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place in this partial hundred.\n\nSimilarly, '8' appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 8, which is from 480 to 489. But since we're only going up to 488, it's from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, '8' appears 9 times in the tens place in this partial hundred.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm counting correctly. From 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, for each ten's group, like 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. So, in the tens place, '4' occurs in the group 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's. '8' occurs in the group 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 '8's.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place for the partial hundred, we have 10 '4's and 9 '8's.\n\nAdding this to the complete hundreds: 40 '4's + 10 '4's = 50 '4's, and 40 '8's + 9 '8's = 49 '8's.\n\nSo, in the tens place, '4' appears 50 times and '8' appears 49 times. So, there's a difference of 1 more '4' in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is '4' for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many times does '4' appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about '8' in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, '8' never appears in the hundreds place because 488 is less than 800. Therefore, '8' appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, '4' appears 89 times and '8' appears 0 times. That's a difference of 89 more '4's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor '4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal '4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor '8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal '8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference between the number of '4's and '8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 '4' and 1 '8'. Then, the extra 8 numbers (481-488) have '4' at 484 and '8' at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Complete hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40 each.\n- Partial hundred (401-488): '4' appears 10 times (440-449), '8' appears 9 times (480-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 '4's, 40 + 9 = 49 '8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- '4' appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- '8' never appears in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nAdding up:\n- '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, there are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more '4's are printed than '8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add 1 '4' (484) and 1 '8' (488).\n   - Total: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 sets, contributing 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488): '4' appears 10 times (440-449), '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, I need to calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then check the remaining pages. \n\nLet me compute the number of complete tens. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). \n\nIn each of these 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, in the extra 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these extra pages, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484), and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, they are equal in the units place. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, right? Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut again, we need to consider how many complete hundreds there are and the remaining pages. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of these 4 complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 4*10=40 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4*10=40 times as well. \n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nFrom 401-409, the tens digit is 0. From 410-419, it's 1; 420-429, it's 2; 430-439, it's 3; 440-449, it's 4; 450-459, it's 5; 460-469, it's 6; 470-479, it's 7; and 480-488, it's 8. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is 10 pages, but our range is up to 488. So, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, 480-488 has the tens digit as 8, but that's only 9 pages (480-488 is 9 pages because 488-480=8, but inclusive, so 9 pages). Wait, actually, 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. \n\nWait, but in the tens place, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, but in the last partial hundred (401-488), it appears 9 times in the tens place. So, the total number of 8's in the tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 49. Similarly, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-409: tens digit 0\n- 410-419: tens digit 1\n- 420-429: tens digit 2\n- 430-439: tens digit 3\n- 440-449: tens digit 4 (10 times)\n- 450-459: tens digit 5\n- 460-469: tens digit 6\n- 470-479: tens digit 7\n- 480-488: tens digit 8 (9 times)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. \n\nThe total number of 8's in the tens place is 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it changes less frequently. From 1-99, there's no hundreds digit, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nWhat about the hundreds digit for 8? Well, in the range of 1-488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit is 8 zero times. \n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. \n\nNow, let me summarize the counts:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 49\n  - 8's: 49\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 50\n  - 8's: 49\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's, 49 + 49 is 98, plus 0 is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times because pages 400-488 have 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 50 times: 4*10 from the complete hundreds and 10 from 440-449. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, 4 appears 49 times: 48 from the complete tens and 1 from 484. Similarly, 8 appears 49 times: 48 from the complete tens and 1 from 488. So, units place is balanced.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 has one more than 8 (50 vs 49). So, total 4's: 188, 8's: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nLet me try calculating the number of 4's:\n\nUnits place: As before, 49.\n\nTens place: 50.\n\nHundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. Wait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. That's correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nAnd for the tens place, 440-449 is 10 pages, so that's 10 4's in the tens place, plus 4*10 from the complete hundreds, which is 40, totaling 50. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, it's 4*10=40 from the complete hundreds, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nUnits place is 49 each.\n\nSo, 188 vs 98, difference of 90. Hmm.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcounting the hundreds place. Let me think: from 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, but from 400-488, it's 4. So, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of 4's in each digit place.\n\nWait, another approach: for each digit place, calculate how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's: 48 +1=49, 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\n488 / 100 = 4 full cycles, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's. Then, the remaining 88 pages (401-488). In the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, with each digit appearing 10 times except the last one, which is 8 appearing 9 times because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, for 4's in the tens place: in the last 88 pages, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (440-449). So, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 +10=50.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: in the last 88 pages, 8 appears in the tens place for 9 pages (480-488). So, total 8's in tens place:4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nAs before, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by understanding how digits are distributed in page numbers. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers, but since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a 3-digit number. So, I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI remember that in such problems, it's helpful to break down the counting based on each digit position. So, I'll handle the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, and each group contributes one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full groups, and then in the last partial group from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers. So, the number of such numbers is floor(488 / 10) = 48. But since 488 is the last number, and 488 mod 10 is 8, so the last number with 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place 4's: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? \n\nLet's see, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, from 1-100, 10 times; 101-200, another 10 times; 201-300, another 10 times; 301-400, another 10 times; and 401-488, which is the next block. \n\nWait, 401-488: how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 401-409, the tens digit is 0, so 4 in the tens place starts at 440-449. So, 440-449 is within 401-488, and that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 10 (from 1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 10 (401-488) = 50 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last block is 401-488, which includes 440-449. So, yes, that's 10 more, making it 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems right.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's floor(488 / 10) = 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last number with 8 in the units place is 488 itself. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, no. Because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. The number of complete blocks is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, and then in the incomplete block (481-488), 488 is the last number, which has 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488) instead of 10. So, how many complete blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89, that's 10 times.\n\n101-200: 180-189, another 10 times.\n\n201-300: 280-289, another 10 times.\n\n301-400: 380-389, another 10 times.\n\n401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 9 (401-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 50, but let's see:\n\nFrom 1-100: 40-49: 10 times\n101-200: 140-149: 10 times\n201-300: 240-249: 10 times\n301-400: 340-349: 10 times\n401-488: 440-449: 10 times\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place:\n\nFrom 1-400: 4 blocks, each 10, so 40\n401-488: 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9\nTotal: 49\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 (since 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, and 484 is the last one, so 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, earlier I thought units place for 4's was 48, but now I'm confused.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nUnits place for 4's: how many times does 4 appear in the units digit from 1 to 488.\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nSo, the number of such numbers is floor(488 / 10) = 48, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. But 488 is the last number, and 488 mod 10 is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place 4's: 48.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's: from 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nNumber of such numbers: floor(488 / 10) = 48, but since 488 is included, it's 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's correct because 488 is the 49th occurrence of 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, units place 4's: 48\nUnits place 8's: 49\n\nTens place 4's: 50\nTens place 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place 4's: 89\nHundreds place 8's: 0\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers, across 5 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488), totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, with 48 full groups plus 488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers, across 4 blocks (1-400) plus 9 times in 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, so 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once (like on page 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the same goes for 8 (like on page 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra pages. In each of these 48 sets, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, that's 48 times each. \n\nBut wait, there are 8 extra pages after the 480th page, which are pages 481 to 488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (on page 484) and 8 appears once (on page 488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so in the units place, they are equal. That means the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49) and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). \n\nBut wait, the book only goes up to 488 pages, so I need to check if the hundreds place affects this. The hundreds digit goes from 0 to 4, right? Because the book is 488 pages, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, for the tens place, let's calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. \n\nFirst, for the digit 4 in the tens place: Each hundred block (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has a set of ten pages where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. \n\nWait, but the last hundred block is 400-488, so does 440-449 exist? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's five sets of ten where the tens digit is 4. Each set contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 x 10 = 50 times. \n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: Each hundred block has a set where the tens digit is 8, which is 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. That's still nine pages, right? Because 480 to 488 is nine pages, not ten. So, does that affect the count? \n\nWait, no, because when we're looking at the tens digit, whether it's 480-489 or 480-488, the tens digit is still 8 for all those pages. So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is nine pages, but actually, the tens digit is 8 for all nine pages. So, each hundred block contributes 10 times for the tens digit 8 except the last one? Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the 400-488 block, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is nine pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all nine of those. So, does that mean that in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 10? \n\nWait, let me think again. The tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 appears only from 480-488, which is nine pages. So, that's 9 occurrences of the digit 8 in the tens place in the 400-488 block. But in the other blocks, like 0-99, 100-199, etc., the tens digit 8 appears 10 times each. \n\nSo, how many hundred blocks do we have? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. That's five blocks. In the first four blocks, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times each, so that's 4 x 10 = 40 times. In the last block, 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). So, total for the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times for the digit 8. \n\nWait, but earlier, for the digit 4 in the tens place, I thought it was 5 x 10 = 50 times because in each of the five hundred blocks, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. But wait, let's check that. \n\nIn the 0-99 block, the tens digit 4 is from 40-49, which is 10 pages. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10 pages. Same for 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449, which is 10 pages, right? Because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences of the tens digit 4, and there are five hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). So, 5 x 10 = 50 times for the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the hundreds place? From page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because the highest hundreds digit is 4 (for 400-488). So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the count for 8 in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times. The difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 - 49 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 49 = 1\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nAdding these up: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting again with the units place: Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. 488 divided by 10 is 48 full sets, so 48 times each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) include 484 and 488, so 484 has a 4 in the units place and 488 has an 8. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. So, units difference is 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For 4, each hundred block has 10 occurrences, and there are five hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). So, 5 x 10 = 50 for 4. For 8, in each of the first four hundred blocks, there are 10 occurrences, so 4 x 10 = 40. In the last block, 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 occurrences. So, total for 8 in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. So, 50 - 49 = 1. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. So, 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nAdding them up: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nCalculating total number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus 1 more in the remaining 8 pages (484), so 49.\n- Tens place: 5 hundred blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds place: 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nCalculating total number of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus 1 more in the remaining 8 pages (488), so 49.\n- Tens place: 40 (from first four blocks) + 9 (from last block) = 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nYes, that checks out. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** Each set of 10 pages contains one '4'. There are 48 complete sets (480 pages) with 48 '4's, plus one more in pages 481-488 (page 484), totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Each hundred block contributes 10 '4's. With five hundred blocks, this is 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place, totaling 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4's, there are 49 '8's.\n   - **Tens place:** Four hundred blocks contribute 10 '8's each (40), plus nine in pages 480-488, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's appear here.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should probably understand how page numbers are structured. Each page has a number from 1 to 488, and each digit in these numbers can be analyzed separately. The problem is asking about the count of the digit '4' and the digit '8' in all these page numbers. Then, I need to find the difference between the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times each digit appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, sum them up separately for 4's and 8's and subtract the two totals to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of times '4' and '8' appear in each position and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the digits in the units place are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, '4' appears once and '8' appears once in every block of 10 pages. This pattern repeats every 10 pages.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, the digits cycle every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, '4' appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49) and '8' appears 10 times (80-89). This pattern repeats every 100 pages.\n\nIn the hundreds place, for numbers from 1-999, the hundreds digit cycles every 1000 pages, but since our book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit goes from 0 (for pages 1-99) to 4 (for pages 400-488). So, '4' appears in the hundreds place for 89 pages (400-488), while '8' doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because the book ends at 488.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and '8' doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all in this book.\n\nNow, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra pages (481-488).\n\nIn each group of 10, the units digit is '4' once and '8' once. So, for 48 complete groups, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48.\n\nNow, for the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, '4' appears once and '8' appears once. So, adding these to the previous counts:\n\nTotal 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, the units place has equal numbers of 4's and 8's, each appearing 49 times.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place.\n\nFor the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is '4' for 10 numbers (40-49) and '8' for 10 numbers (80-89).\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit '4' appears 10 times and '8' appears 10 times. So, for 4 complete hundreds, the count is:\n\n4 * 10 = 40 for '4's in tens place\n4 * 10 = 40 for '8's in tens place\n\nNow, we need to check the remaining 88 pages (401-488). Let's see how the tens digit behaves here.\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 10 pages. So, in 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; 421-430, tens digit is 2; 431-440, tens digit is 3; 441-450, tens digit is 4; 451-460, tens digit is 5; 461-470, tens digit is 6; 471-480, tens digit is 7; and 481-488, tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 401 to 410, the tens digit is 0 (401 is 4 0 1, so tens digit is 0). Then 411-420 is tens digit 1, etc., up to 481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, the last part is 481-488, which is 8 pages with tens digit 8.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages, how many times does '4' and '8' appear in the tens place?\n\nLooking at each block:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 pages)\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 blocks of 10 pages each (401-410, 411-420,...,471-480) and then 481-488, which is 8 pages.\n\nWait, actually, 401-488 is 88 pages. 88 divided by 10 is 8.8, so 8 complete blocks of 10, and then 8 pages left.\n\nWait, but let's count each block:\n\n401-410: 10 pages\n411-420: 10 pages\n421-430: 10 pages\n431-440: 10 pages\n441-450: 10 pages\n451-460: 10 pages\n461-470: 10 pages\n471-480: 10 pages\n481-488: 8 pages\n\nWait, that's 9 blocks, but 8 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 8. Wait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8*10 + 8, so 8 full blocks and one partial block.\n\nBut in terms of tens digits:\n\nIn 401-410, tens digit is 0\n411-420: 1\n421-430: 2\n431-440: 3\n441-450: 4\n451-460: 5\n461-470: 6\n471-480: 7\n481-488: 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, '4' appears in the block 441-450, which is 10 times.\n\n'8' appears in the block 481-488, but since that's only 8 pages, does that mean the tens digit is '8' for all 8 pages? Yes, because 481 is 4 8 1, 482 is 4 8 2, etc., up to 488. So, the tens digit is '8' for all 8 pages.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit is '4' 10 times and '8' 8 times.\n\nTherefore, the total counts for the tens place:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nWait, is that correct? Wait, no. Because the 40 comes from the 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, we have an additional 10 '4's in the tens place (from 441-450) and 8 '8's in the tens place (from 481-488).\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nAs I thought earlier, the hundreds digit is '4' for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about '8's in the hundreds place? Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches '8'. The hundreds digits go from 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, '8' never appears in the hundreds place. So, the count for '8's in hundreds place is 0.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in hundreds place: 89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor '4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor '8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 91.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each 10 pages: 1 '4' and 1 '8'\n- 48 complete groups: 48 '4's and 48 '8's\n- Remaining 8 pages: 1 '4' and 1 '8'\nTotal units: 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 pages: 10 '4's and 10 '8's in tens place\n- 4 complete hundreds: 40 '4's and 40 '8's\n- Remaining 88 pages: 10 '4's in 441-450 and 8 '8's in 481-488\nTotal tens: 50 '4's and 48 '8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does '4' appear in units place?\n- It's the same as the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9, so floor(488/10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing one '4', and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), '4' appears once (484).\n- So, total '4's in units: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, '8's in units place: same logic, 48 full cycles plus one '8' in the remaining (488), so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n- For '4's in tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is '4' (40-49, 140-149, etc.)\n- There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10 = 40.\n- Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit '4' appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers.\n- So, total '4's in tens: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor '8's in tens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is '8' (80-89, 180-189, etc.)\n- 4 complete hundreds: 4*10 = 40.\n- In the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit '8' appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n- So, total '8's in tens: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n- '4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 '4's.\n- '8's: None, since the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit never reaches '8'.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 groups.\n   - Each group contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8' in the units place.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute 1 '4' and 1 '8'.\n   - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds in 488 pages: 4 hundreds.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - '4's: 10 times (441-450)\n     - '8's: 8 times (481-488)\n   - Total '4's in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50\n   - Total '8's in tens place: 4*10 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4's: Pages 400-488 contribute 89 '4's.\n   - '8's: No occurrence since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89\n   - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - Total '8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit '4' is printed 91 more times than the digit '8'.  \n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. Each page from 1 to 488 has its number printed once. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nAlright, so let me start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers, depending on how big the page count is. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll have to consider all three places: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, it's helpful to break it down by each digit place separately. So, I'll handle the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place individually for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll go through each place one by one.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - For example, from 1-10: 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - From 11-20: 4 appears once (page 14).\n   - And so on.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, there are 488 / 10 = 48 complete blocks of 10, and then 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - In each complete block, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times.\n   - Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once more (page 484).\n   - So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 pages. Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100.\n   - For example, from 1-100: the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times.\n   - From 101-200: similarly, 140-149, another 10 times.\n   - Continuing this way up to 400-488.\n   - Let's calculate how many complete hundreds there are. Since 488 is less than 500, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n   - In each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 times.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 every 10 pages. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the tens place here.\n   - From 401-410: tens digit is 0.\n   - 411-420: tens digit is 1.\n   - 421-430: tens digit is 2.\n   - 431-440: tens digit is 3.\n   - 441-450: tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 pages (441-450). But wait, our range is up to 488, so 441-450 is within 401-488. So, that's 10 times.\n   - Then, from 451-460: tens digit is 5, and so on, up to 480-488: tens digit is 8.\n   - So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit is 4 exactly once, from 441-450, which is 10 times. Wait, but 450 is within 488, so yes, that's 10 times.\n   - Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so in the 401-488 range, the tens digit cycles 0-8. So, for tens digit 4, it's 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 times.\n   - Therefore, in the incomplete hundred, we have 10 more 4's in the tens place.\n   - So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from incomplete) = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive?\n   - That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I thought each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds give 40, and then in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs once, giving another 10, so 50 total. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, 48 full tens blocks (1-480) give 48 4's, and then 481-488 gives one more 4 (484), so 49 total. That adds up.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, each block of 10 has one 8 in the units place.\n   - Total pages: 488, so 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 times.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488).\n   - So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles 0-9 every 100 pages. Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n   - So, in each complete hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - We have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n   - Let's see how many times 8 appears in the tens place here.\n   - From 401-410: tens digit 0.\n   - 411-420: tens digit 1.\n   - ...\n   - 481-490: tens digit 8. But wait, our range is only up to 488, so 481-488 is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them.\n   - So, in 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers (481-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 8 times.\n   - Wait, but in the tens place, each block of 10 has the same tens digit. So, 481-490 would have tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers (481-488), each with tens digit 8. So, that's 8 times, not 10.\n   - Therefore, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n   - So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from incomplete) = 48.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers: 481, 482, ..., 488. So, yes, 8 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, 0 times.\n\nNow, summing up all the 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, 40 + 8 = 48. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks (1-480) give 48 8's, and 481-488 gives one more 8 (page 488). So, 49 total.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nWait, but when I add 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds), it's 97. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 97. So, the difference would be 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me think again.\n\nIn the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 8's. So, 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so that's 8 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, 8 more, making it 48. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in the incomplete hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, making it 50.\n\nWait, but in the case of 8's, in the incomplete hundred, it's only 8 numbers, not 10. So, that's why it's 8.\n\nWait, but when I did the 4's, in the incomplete hundred, I had 10 numbers (441-450), so 10 4's. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 97.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188 - 97 = 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't double-count anything or miss any numbers.\n\nLet me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place again, but more carefully.\n\n**Alternative approach for 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For each 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full tens and 8 extra pages.\n   - So, 48 * 1 = 48.\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For each 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds and 0.88 of another hundred.\n   - 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles every 10 pages.\n   - The tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 pages. But since 488 is beyond 450, we have all 10 pages. So, 10 more.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - So, 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Alternative approach for 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each 10 pages, 8 appears once. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra pages.\n   - 48 * 1 = 48.\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each 100 pages, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds and 0.88 of another hundred.\n   - 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 pages (since 481-488 is 8 numbers, each with tens digit 8).\n   - So, 8 more.\n   - Total: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but the book ends at 488, so 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 481-490, but since we stop at 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, that's 8 times, correct.\n\nYes, so the count seems accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds. Because when counting digits, their occurrences can vary based on their position. Let me start by understanding how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 each appear once in the units place. So from page 1 to page 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Then this pattern repeats every 10 pages. \n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, I can divide 488 by 10 to find out how many complete sets of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So that means there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages.\n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So for 48 complete sets, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48, and similarly, the number of 8's would also be 48.\n\nNow, for the remaining 8 pages (from 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So the units digit 4 appears once (at page 484), and the digit 8 appears once (at page 488). So that's 1 more 4 and 1 more 8 in the units place. \n\nAdding these up, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Wait, so in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times. Hmm, that's interesting. So maybe the difference comes from the tens place.\n\nMoving on to the tens place: The tens digit changes every 10 pages. For example, from page 1-9, the tens digit is 0. From 10-19, it's 1, and so on. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. \n\nBut since our book has 488 pages, let's see how many times each digit appears in the tens place. \n\nFirst, let's break it down by hundreds. From page 1 to 400, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 every 100 pages. So for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. \n\nFrom 1-100: Tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. \n\nSimilarly, from 101-200, the tens digits again cycle through 0-9, so each digit appears another 10 times. \n\nThis pattern continues up to 400, which is 4 times 100. So from 1-400, each digit in the tens place appears 4*10 = 40 times. \n\nBut wait, the book goes up to 488, so we have 88 pages beyond 400. Let's consider pages 401-488. \n\nIn the tens place, pages 401-409 have a tens digit of 0, 410-419 have 1, 420-429 have 2, 430-439 have 3, 440-449 have 4, 450-459 have 5, 460-469 have 6, 470-479 have 7, 480-488 have 8. \n\nNow, each of these blocks (except maybe the last one) has 10 pages, so the tens digit appears 10 times each. \n\nSo for the tens digit in 401-488:\n\n- 401-409: 9 pages, tens digit 0, so 0 appears 9 times.\n- 410-419: 10 pages, tens digit 1, so 1 appears 10 times.\n- 420-429: 10 pages, tens digit 2, so 2 appears 10 times.\n- 430-439: 10 pages, tens digit 3, so 3 appears 10 times.\n- 440-449: 10 pages, tens digit 4, so 4 appears 10 times.\n- 450-459: 10 pages, tens digit 5, so 5 appears 10 times.\n- 460-469: 10 pages, tens digit 6, so 6 appears 10 times.\n- 470-479: 10 pages, tens digit 7, so 7 appears 10 times.\n- 480-488: 9 pages, tens digit 8, so 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but actually, from 401-488, that's 88 pages. Let me check: 400 is the 400th page, so 401 is 401, and 488 is the last page. So from 401-488, that's 88 pages. Let me see how each tens digit block contributes:\n\n- 401-409: 9 pages (tens digit 0)\n- 410-419: 10 pages\n- 420-429: 10 pages\n- 430-439: 10 pages\n- 440-449: 10 pages\n- 450-459: 10 pages\n- 460-469: 10 pages\n- 470-479: 10 pages\n- 480-488: 9 pages (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages)\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 10*7 + 9 = 9 + 70 + 9 = 88 pages, which checks out.\n\nNow, for the tens digit:\n\n- 0 appears 9 times\n- 1 appears 10 times\n- 2 appears 10 times\n- 3 appears 10 times\n- 4 appears 10 times\n- 5 appears 10 times\n- 6 appears 10 times\n- 7 appears 10 times\n- 8 appears 9 times\n\nSo, from 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, adding to the previous 400 pages where each digit in the tens place appeared 40 times (since each hundred contributes 10 times per digit, and 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40). So:\n\n- For digit 4 in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 times.\n- For digit 8 in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, from 1-400, each digit in the tens place appears 40 times, correct. Then from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. So total for 4 in tens place is 40 +10=50, and for 8 it's 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times in tens place, and 8 appears 9 times. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo total in tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 50 times\n- 8 appears 49 times\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 1 appears 100 times (from 100-199)\n- 2 appears 100 times (from 200-299)\n- 3 appears 100 times (from 300-399)\n- 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488, which is 89 pages: 488 - 400 +1 = 89)\n\nWait, 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. So the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 appears 0 times, since the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in a 488-page book.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place.\n\nFirst, for digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nNow, for digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, earlier I had 49 units for 8, 49 tens, and 0 hundreds, so 98 total. But let me double-check each place.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1 eight, so 48, plus the last 8 pages (481-488) where 8 appears once in units place, so 48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-400, each digit appears 40 times, so 8 appears 40 times. Then from 401-488, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place, so total 40+9=49. That's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 8 never appears, so 0.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nSo the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times, so from 1-488, tens place for 4 is 40 (from 1-400) +10=50.\n\nIn the units place, 4 appears 49 times.\n\nSo 4's total: 89 +50 +49= 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 49\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I think about the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit for 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So from 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears 40 (from 1-400) +9=49 times.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, from 1-400, each digit appears 40 times, so 8 appears 40 times. Then from 401-488, 8 appears 9 times, so total 49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0, so 98.\n\nSo 4's: 188, 8's:98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I thought maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the units place again.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. So 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48 times, plus in the last partial cycle, from 481-488, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 4 appears once more, so total 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8: same calculation, 49 times.\n\nSo units place correct.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, each digit appears 40 times, so 4 and 8 each appear 40 times. Then from 401-488:\n\nFor 4 in tens place, 440-449: 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nFor 8 in tens place, 480-488: 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nThus, 4's tens:40+10=50, 8's tens:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's total: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 =98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits place: As above, 49.\n\nTens place: From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place.\n\nEach hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 hundreds in 488, so 4*10=40 times. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's 10 more, making it 50.\n\nSimilarly, hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place: From 1-488, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit, so 40 times for 8 in the tens place. Then in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, so 9 more, total 49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nSo 8's total:49+49=98.\n\nThus, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I should break down the counting based on the number of digits.\n\nI think the best approach is to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4), and 8 appears once (page 8). This pattern repeats every 10 numbers.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 complete blocks and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete block of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each. Now, the partial block from 481 to 488: the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, the count for units place is equal for both digits.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times each.\n\nNow, the partial hundred from 401-488: the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 times (480-488). Wait, no, actually, from 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8 in 480-488. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, total 4's are 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial hundred) = 50 times, and 8's are 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each ten's place, 40-49 would be 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, 80-89 in the 400s would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, yes, 10 times for 4 and 9 times for 8 in the tens place for the partial hundred.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4's = 4*10 + 10 = 50, 8's = 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. For each hundred block, the hundreds digit is fixed. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears only in the 400-488 range. \n\nFrom 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800 would be the next hundred, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the counts.\n\nWait, earlier in the tens place, I had 4's as 50 and 8's as 49, but let me make sure.\n\nWait, for the units place, I had 49 each for 4 and 8. Tens place: 50 for 4 and 49 for 8. Hundreds place: 89 for 4 and 0 for 8.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99; 99+89=188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49+49=98\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check if I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: for each 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens and then 8 more numbers. So, 48*1=48, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's: 48+1=49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the last 8 numbers, 488 has 8, so 48+1=49. So that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 each. Then, the partial hundred from 401-488: the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 4's in tens place: 40+10=50, 8's: 40+9=49. That's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place: Only from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a large number. Let me think differently. Maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if last digit >=8, add 1. 488 mod 10=8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4, which gives 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 0-8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10. So total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in tens place: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, 40 +9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since we're dealing with 488, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's.\n\nNumber of 8's in hundreds place: Since 488 < 800, there are 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can list out the counts for each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal 4's: For each 10 numbers, 1 four. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 48+1=49.\n\nSame for 8's: 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers, 8 appears once (488). So, 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4 (40-49). There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50.\n\nFor 8's: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8 (80-89). 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. In 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 4's appear in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's.\n\n8's: None, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in Each Digit Place:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - For every 10 numbers, each digit (0-9) appears once in the units place.\n     - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 instances each for 4 and 8.\n     - The last partial set (481-488) adds one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n     - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n     - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - For every 100 numbers, each digit (0-9) appears 10 times in the tens place.\n     - From 1 to 400, there are 4 complete sets of 100, contributing 40 instances each for 4 and 8.\n     - From 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times), and 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n     - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n     - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - From 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n     - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages.\n     - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89\n     - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\n2. **Summing Up the Counts:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Total 4's - Total 8's = 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Maybe I can calculate how many times each digit (4 and 8) appears in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the same goes for 8 (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, the units place will go through 48 complete sets of 10 (from 1 to 480) and then 8 more pages (481 to 488). So, for the complete sets, each digit (4 and 8) appears 48 times in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). \n\nAdding those up: 48 (complete sets) + 1 (partial set) = 49 times for 4 in the units place. Similarly, 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8 in the units place. Hmm, so they're equal in the units place.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49) and 8 ten times (80-89). So, in each set of 100, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, that's 4 complete sets of 100 (1-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nFor each complete set of 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so for 4 sets, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per set, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-409: tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8.\n410-419: tens digit is 1, no.\n420-429: tens digit is 2, no.\n430-439: tens digit is 3, no.\n440-449: tens digit is 4, so that's 10 times for 4.\n450-459: tens digit is 5, no.\n460-469: tens digit is 6, no.\n470-479: tens digit is 7, no.\n480-488: tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So that's 9 times for 8.\n\nWait, but from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 times (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 pages). So, 4 appears 10 times in 440-449, and 8 appears 9 times in 480-488.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times for 4. For 8, it's 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is ahead by 1 here.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4 or 8. From 100-199, it's 1, 200-299 it's 2, 300-399 it's 3, 400-488 it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times. That's a big difference.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit across all places.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- 48 complete sets of 10: 48 * 1 = 48\n- Partial set 481-488: 484 and 488, so 2 more? Wait, no, in the units place, 484 has a 4 in units, and 488 has an 8. So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So, units place for 4: 48 +1=49, same for 8: 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 complete sets of 100: 4 *10=40 each.\n- From 401-488:\n  - 440-449: 10 times for 4\n  - 480-488: 9 times for 8\nSo, 4: 40 +10=50, 8:40 +9=49.

After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers range from 1 (a single digit) up to 488 (a three-digit number). \n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the counting based on the number of digits: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. For each position, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For any given page number, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of 10 consecutive numbers. \n\nSo, for the units place:\n- The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n- The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nNow, how many sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll consider 48 full sets and then the remaining 8 pages. \n\nWait, actually, maybe it's better to think of it as 488 pages, so the units digit cycles 48 full times (each cycle being 10 pages) and then 8 more pages. So, in each full cycle of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 full cycles, that's 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once and 8 appears once in the remaining pages. \n\nSo, total units place:\n- 4's: 48 (from full cycles) + 1 (from remaining) = 49\n- 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWait, that seems equal, so maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when I have 488 pages, the number of full tens is 48, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the last 8 pages (481 to 488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in those, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, yes, both 4 and 8 get an extra count in the units place, making it 48 +1 = 49 each.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so the units digits go up to 8, so yes, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place in the remaining pages.\n\nSo, units place: 49 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. So, for example, from 1-10, the tens digit is 0 or 1. Wait, actually, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, but in page numbers, we don't write leading zeros, so maybe I should adjust my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of each digit position separately. Let me try to structure this better.\n\nFor the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each tens digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens place, in each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nNow, how many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, the full hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 401-488 is 88 pages, so it's not a full hundred.\n\nSo, in each of the first four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nSo, for the first 400 pages, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40 for 4's, and 4 x 10 = 40 for 8's.\n\nNow, what about the remaining 88 pages from 401 to 488? Let's see, the tens digit in this range is from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so it goes up to 488.\n\nWait, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but since 488 is the last page, the tens digit for 481-488 is 8, and then 489-490 would be the next, but we don't have those pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nFirst, let's list the tens digits in 401-488:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers (441 to 450), but wait, 441 to 450 is 10 numbers, but 450 is included, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 numbers: 481-488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, so in the tens place from 401-488:\n- 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place:\n- 4's: 4 hundreds x 10 = 40, plus 10 in the remaining 88 pages, so 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 4 hundreds x 10 = 40, plus 8 in the remaining 88 pages, so 40 + 8 = 48\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It appears once for each page from 400 to 488, which is 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in all places.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8, but let me confirm that.\n\nWait, 488 pages, so units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 x 1 = 48 for each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 +1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 40 +10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 +8 = 48 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's.\n\nAdding them up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 91 seems like a lot more 4's than 8's. Let me see if I made a mistake in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these. So, that's 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 401-488: the tens digit 4 occurs from 441-450, which is 10 pages, and 8 occurs from 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 97 = 91. Hmm, maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAnother way is to count all the 4's and 8's in each digit position separately.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal number of 4's in units place: For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total number of 4's in units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if the last partial set includes 4, which it does (484), so +1, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: same logic, 48 +1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor the tens digit, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490). But since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 only appears from 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 4 appears from 441-450, which is 10 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nSo, total tens place:\n- 4's: 40 +10 =50\n- 8's: 40 +8=48\n\nHundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times for 4. 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total counts:\n- 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n- 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91\n\nSo, yeah, I think that's correct. There are 91 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total full cycles: 48, contributing 48 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488): 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - Total: 49 times each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - First 400 pages: 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488): 4 appears 10 times (441-450), 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total: 50 times for 4, 48 times for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should understand the problem clearly. Each page from 1 to 488 is numbered once, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and subtract the number of times the digit 8 appears. The result will tell me how many more 4's there are than 8's. \n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nI think the best approach is to count the occurrences of each digit (4 and 8) in each place (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then sum them up. After that, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's in the units place.**\n2. **Count the number of 4's in the tens place.**\n3. **Count the number of 4's in the hundreds place.**\n4. **Do the same for 8's: count in units, tens, and hundreds places.**\n5. **Sum up all the 4's and all the 8's.**\n6. **Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to get the difference.**\n\nStarting with the 4's:\n\n**1. Counting 4's in the units place:**\nIn every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is within this range, which adds one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, yes, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\n**2. Counting 4's in the tens place:**\nSimilarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many such ranges are there up to 488?\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n- 140-149: 10 4's.\n- 240-249: 10 4's.\n- 340-349: 10 4's.\n- 440-449: 10 4's.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's five ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. \n\nWait, but let me check the upper limit. The book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is fine, but what about 540-549? That's beyond 488, so it's not included. So, yes, only up to 440-449, which is the fifth range. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.) has exactly one range where the tens digit is 4, which is 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 4's)\n100-199: 140-149 (10 4's)\n200-299: 240-249 (10 4's)\n300-399: 340-349 (10 4's)\n400-488: 440-449 (10 4's)\nSo that's five ranges, each contributing 10, so 50. So, yes, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n**3. Counting 4's in the hundreds place:**\nThe hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's compute that.\n\n49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n**1. 8's in the units place:**\nSimilar to 4's, every ten numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 8's. Now, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, 488 is included, which adds one more 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check: 481-488 is 8 numbers, 481 to 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, yes, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n**2. 8's in the tens place:**\nThe digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Each of these ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 8's in tens place.\n- 180-189: 10 8's.\n- 280-289: 10 8's.\n- 380-389: 10 8's.\n- 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of these has an 8, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 8's, so that's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n**3. 8's in the hundreds place:**\nThe hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 49\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98. So, total 8's are 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. Each of the ranges 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 380-389, each contribute 10 8's, so that's 4 ranges, 10 each, so 40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 8's in the tens place, so 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, total 4's were 188, and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, 188 4's and 98 8's, so 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me verify each step.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n  - 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4. Then, 484 adds one more, so 49.\n- Tens: 50\n  - Each hundred block has a 40-49 range, contributing 10. From 0-488, there are five such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). So, 5*10=50.\n- Hundreds: 89\n  - From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n  - 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. Then, 488 adds one more, so 49.\n- Tens: 49\n  - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: 4 ranges, each 10, so 40. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9. Total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in the units place, 488 is included, so that adds one more 8. So, units: 49, tens: 49, total 98.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, 484 has both a 4 in the units and hundreds place, but I counted each occurrence separately, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, 448 has a 4 in the hundreds and tens place, but each digit is counted separately, so that's fine.\n\nI think the calculations are correct.

    "text": " I'm going to take it slow because I want to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the problem is asking. It's about counting how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then doing the same for the digit 8. After finding both counts, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the plan is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference. Let me start with the 4's.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can systematically count how many times 4 appears in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such sets are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. That means there are 48 sets where 4 appears once in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so we have to check if the last set is complete. Since 488 is 48*10 + 8, the last set is 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so the units digit 4 in 484 would be included. Wait, no, 484 is within 481-490, so actually, the 48th set is complete up to 480, and then we have 481-488. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, adding one more 4. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier by not considering that 488 is beyond 480, so the 48th set ends at 480, and the next set is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, in the units place, 484 is the only additional 4, so total units 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 484 is included, adding one more 4. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, 4 appears in a block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes ten 4's in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nWell, let's think. The first block is 40-49, which is within 1-488. Then, the next block is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each contributes ten 4's in the tens place, so 5 blocks * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is one, 140-149 is two, 240-249 is three, 340-349 is four, and 440-449 is five. So, five blocks, each contributing ten 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, tens place 4's are 50.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 40-49: 10 numbers, 10 4's in tens place. Similarly for each subsequent hundred. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. So, tens place 4's are 50.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't overcount.\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, every ten numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Every hundred numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for ten numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.). From 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is in the 400s, so we have four full hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s, but it's not a full hundred. So, in the 0-99 range, we have one block (40-49), contributing 10 4's. Similarly, in 100-199, another block (140-149), 10 4's. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 4's. 300-399: 340-349, 10 4's. And in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is ten numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 4's. So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. So, tens place 4's are 50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in each set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 488 is included, so yes, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's correct.\n\nNow, tens place for 8's. Similar to 4's, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for ten numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, which is incomplete. So, how many 8's in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for ten numbers. So, in 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers, 10 8's. In 100-199: 180-189, 10 8's. In 200-299: 280-289, 10 8's. In 300-399: 380-389, 10 8's. In 400-488: 480-488, which is nine numbers (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 for nine numbers, contributing nine 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 4 hundreds * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, 10. 200-299: 280-289, 10. 300-399: 380-389, 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 480,481,...,488, so that's nine numbers. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place 8's are 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8's. The hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check:\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets of ten, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes ten 8's in the tens place, except the last hundred, which only contributes nine because we stop at 488. So, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, total 49.\n\nHundreds place: None, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, so the difference is 90. That seems correct based on my calculations.\n\nBut let me just cross-verify to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the cases and didn't miss any numbers. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. Each page from 1 to 488 is numbered once, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, so I need a systematic way to count the number of times each digit appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers. Let me start by considering each digit position separately.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once.\n\nBut wait, the book has 488 pages, so the total number of pages is 488. Let me see how many complete blocks of 10 there are and if there's a partial block at the end.\n\nDividing 488 by 10 gives me 48 complete blocks and 8 remaining pages. So, for the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in each block, and then in the remaining 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8, right? Wait, no, because the last page is 488, so the units digits in the partial block would be from 1 to 8, but actually, starting from 481 to 488, the units digits would be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once in each block of 10, and in the partial block, it appears once (at 484). Similarly, the digit 8 appears once per block and once in the partial block (at 488). So, for units place, the count for 4's would be 48 (from the complete blocks) plus 1 (from the partial block) = 49. Similarly, for 8's, it would be 48 +1 =49 as well. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place in each block of 100. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 100 is 4 complete hundreds, and then 88 pages remaining. So, for each digit in the tens place, it appears 4 times 10 = 40 times in the complete hundreds. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488), the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410, but wait, 401 is actually 4 0 1, so the tens digit is 0, then 1 for 411-420, but wait, 401-488 is from 401 to 488, so the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, right?\n\nWait, but actually, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digits go through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). Now, each of these tens digits appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears only 8 times because 481-488 is 8 numbers, not 10.\n\nWait, no, actually, 481-490 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the incomplete hundred.\n\nSo, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in each complete hundred, so 4 times 10 = 40 times. In the incomplete hundred, it appears once in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. Wait, no, in the incomplete hundred, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. So, total for 4 in tens place is 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, in the complete hundreds, each hundred has 10 occurrences, so 4*10=40. In the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, total for 8 in tens place is 40 +8=48.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times. So, the difference in the tens place is 50 -48=2 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488, and 0 for pages 1-99. So, let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's here. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's. From 200-299, it's 2, again no 4's or 8's. From 300-399, it's 3, same thing. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many pages are there from 400-488? That's 89 pages (since 488 -400 +1=89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1,2,3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, for the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 -0=89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so yes, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Since 8 never appears in the hundreds place, that's correct.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49 +50 +89= 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49 +48 +0=97\n\nNow, the difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 8, and then in the partial block of 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place:4's=48+1=49, 8's=48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each complete hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 appears 10 times per hundred, and 8 appears 10 times per hundred. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8. For 4 in the tens place, it's from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8 in the tens place, it's from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50, 8's:40+8=48. That's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times, and 8 never appears here. So, 4's:89, 8's:0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\nDifference:188 -97=91\n\nWait, but let me check again because I feel like I might have missed something. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately in each place.\n\nWait, another approach: for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n- Total numbers:488\n- Each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10)=48 times, with a remainder of 8.\n- So, for units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, plus in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each get one more count.\n- So, for 4:48 +1=49\n- For 8:48 +1=49\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 for each digit.\n- The remaining 88 pages (401-488) have tens digits from 0 to 8.\n- For each digit from 0-8, in the tens place, how many times do they appear in 401-488?\n- For digits 0-7: each appears 10 times (e.g., 401-410: tens digit 0, 411-420: tens digit 1, etc.), but wait, 488 is the end, so for digit 8 in tens place, it's from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n- So, for 4 in tens place: in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- For 8 in tens place: from 481-488, 8 times.\n- So, total for 4 in tens place:40 +10=50\n- For 8 in tens place:40 +8=48\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n- From 100-199: hundreds digit 1, no 4's or 8's.\n- From 200-299: hundreds digit 2, no 4's or 8's.\n- From 300-399: hundreds digit 3, no 4's or 8's.\n- From 400-488: hundreds digit 4, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89), so 4 appears 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place, so 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\nDifference:188 -97=91\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 91, but when I first thought about it, I thought maybe 91 was too high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 times. 8's in hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, in the incomplete hundred, it's 10 times (441-450), and in the complete hundreds, 40 times, so 50 total. For 8's, in the incomplete hundred, it's 8 times (481-488), and 40 in complete hundreds, so 48 total.\n\nUnits place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's:49+50+89=188\n8's:49+48+0=97\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nWait, but I'm getting 91, but I feel like maybe I missed something because sometimes in these digit counting problems, it's easy to miscount the incomplete groups.\n\nWait, let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each digit from 0 to 7, how many times do they appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers\n411-420: tens digit1, 10 numbers\n421-430: tens digit2,10 numbers\n431-440: tens digit3,10 numbers\n441-450: tens digit4,10 numbers\n451-460: tens digit5,10 numbers\n461-470: tens digit6,10 numbers\n471-480: tens digit7,10 numbers\n481-488: tens digit8,8 numbers\n\nSo, for digits 0-7 in the tens place, each appears 10 times in the incomplete hundred, and digit8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, for 4 in tens place:10 times in incomplete hundred, plus 40 times in complete hundreds, total 50.\n\nFor 8 in tens place:8 times in incomplete hundred, plus 40 times in complete hundreds, total 48.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, from 401-488, the units digits go from 1-8 in the last partial block, so 4 and 8 each get an extra count, making it 49 each.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 none.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's:49+50+89=188\n8's:49+48+0=97\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I initially thought maybe the answer would be 91, but sometimes in these problems, the hundreds digit might have a different count. Let me check the hundreds digit again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct, and the difference is 91.\n\nWait, but let me check once more for any possible miscalculations.\n\nWait, 4's total:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n8's total:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - Remainder pages: 8 (481-488).\n   - 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (1-400), each contributing 10 times.\n   - Remainder pages: 88 (401-488).\n   - 4 appears 4*10 + 10 = 50 times.\n   - 8 appears 4*10 + 8 = 48 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " I'm going to take it slow because I don't want to make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the problem is asking. It's about counting how many times the digit '4' appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and then comparing that to how many times the digit '8' appears. The difference between these two counts will be the answer.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. I'll go through each place one by one and count the number of 4's and 8's in each, then sum them up for the total counts.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit '4' appears exactly once in the units place, and similarly, the digit '8' appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, right?\n\nBut wait, I need to check how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and an extra 8 pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). So, in each of these 48 blocks, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. That gives 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place.\n\nNow, for the extra 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, the digit '4' appears once (at 484) and the digit '8' appears once (at 488). So, adding this to our counts, we have 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. Wait, that's the same number of 4's and 8's. Hmm, so maybe the units place doesn't contribute to the difference. Let me make a note of that.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each block of 100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for the digit '4' in the tens place, it appears 10 times in each 100-number block (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit '8' appears 10 times in each 100-number block (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nNow, how many complete 100-number blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, which means there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401 to 488.\n\nIn each of these 4 complete blocks, the tens digit '4' appears 10 times, so 4 blocks * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, the digit '8' appears 10 times per block, so 4 blocks * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the partial block from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Let's see, the tens digits in this range go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does '4' appear? It's only in 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, '8' appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 times (480,481,...,488). So, in the partial block, '4' appears 10 times and '8' appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding this to our previous counts: for the tens place, '4' appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, and '8' appears 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. The partial block is from 401 to 488, which is 88 pages. The tens digit cycles every 10 pages, so from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the last tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive).\n\nSo, in the tens place, '4' occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. '8' occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So yes, that's correct. So, the tens place contributes 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit remains the same for 100 consecutive numbers. So, for numbers 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (or not printed, but since we're considering page numbers starting at 1, I think we can treat it as 0 for pages 1-99). From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, the digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Therefore, the digit '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit '8' in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, '8' doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, '8' count in hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, '4' appears 89 times, and '8' appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFirst, for '4's:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal '4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = Let me add them up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 '4's.\n\nFor '8's:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal '8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, 98 '8's.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more '4's are printed than '8's. So, subtract the number of '8's from the number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 '4' and 1 '8', so 48 each.\n- Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute 1 '4' and 1 '8'.\nSo, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 '4's and 49 '8's. That looks correct.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 complete blocks of 100, each contributing 10 '4's and 10 '8's, so 40 each.\n- Partial block 401-488: '4' appears 10 times (440-449), '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\nSo, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 '4's and 40 + 9 = 49 '8's. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place:\n- '4' appears 89 times (400-488).\n- '8' doesn't appear here.\nSo, hundreds place: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\nAdding up:\n'4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n'8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should recount the '4's and '8's in the partial blocks again to make sure.\n\nFor the units place in the partial block (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, '4' appears once (at 484), and '8' appears once (at 488). So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for the partial block 401-488:\n- '4' appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's in the tens place.\n- '8' appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page), so 9 '8's in the tens place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and '8' never appears there.\n\nSo, adding up, '4's total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188, and '8's total 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. The difference is 90.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer should be 90 more '4's than '8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (at 484) and one 8 (at 488).\n   - Total 4's: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n   - Total 8's: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks of 100, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The partial block (401-488) contributes 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: \\(40 + 10 = 50\\)\n   - Total 8's: \\(40 + 9 = 49\\)\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, contributing 89 4's.\n   - The hundreds digit is never 8 in the range 1-488.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\nSumming up the counts:\n- Total 4's: \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\)\n- Total 8's: \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\)\n\nThe difference between the number of 4's and 8's is:\n\\[ 188 - 98 = 90 \\]\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\(\\boxed{90}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Finally, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by understanding how digits are counted in numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for each digit.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears in a range of numbers, it's helpful to break it down by each digit place. So, I'll handle the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. To find how many complete sets of 10 there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 sets with a remainder of 8.\n   - So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times for each set of 10, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (at 484).\n   - Wait, no. Actually, when considering the units place, the remainder doesn't affect the count beyond the last complete set. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me correct that.\n\n   Actually, for the units place, the number of times 4 appears is equal to the number of complete tens plus any additional occurrences in the incomplete set. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, the digit 4 appears 48 times in the units place from 1 to 480, and then in 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers.\n   - How many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n   - In each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 appears once in the 40-49 range within 401-488, but wait, 401-488 is actually 88 numbers, so the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488. Wait, no, 440 is beyond 401, but actually, 401-488 includes 440-449 as part of it. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear here? It's 10 times (440-449). But wait, 440 is 440, which is within 401-488, so yes, 10 times. But wait, 488 is less than 490, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8, but the tens digit 4 would have been in 440-449. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers.\n   - How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, for the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's indeed 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, in each hundred, 40-49 gives 10 times. So, 4 hundreds would be 40 times. Then, in the 401-488 range, which is 88 numbers, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the units place, in each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, in every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, that's 48 full sets of 10, giving 48 times.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, so the units digit 8 appears once (at 488).\n   - So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n   - Wait, but actually, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n   - Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 (from the four hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens + 1 = 49\n- Tens: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in 440-449 = 50\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Tens: 4*10=40, plus 9 in 480-488 = 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of 10 (48 occurrences) + 1 in the remainder (484) = 49\n- **Tens place:** 10 occurrences in each of the 4 hundreds (40) + 10 in 440-449 = 50\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers (400-488) = 89\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of 10 (48 occurrences) + 1 in the remainder (488) = 49\n- **Tens place:** 10 occurrences in each of the 4 hundreds (40) + 9 in 480-488 = 49\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nAlright, so maybe I should approach this by looking at each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds. That seems like a systematic way to ensure I don't miss any numbers. Let me start with the units place because that might be the simplest.\n\n**Counting 4's in the Units Place:**\nIn the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the extra 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit is 1 to 8, so no additional 4's there. So total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\n**Counting 8's in the Units Place:**\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, it also appears once every 10 numbers. Using the same logic, there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so that's 48 times. The extra 8 numbers (481-488) have 8 as the units digit in 488, so that's one more. So total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check that. From 1 to 480, it's 48 times, and then from 481 to 488, 488 is the only number with 8 in the units place, so that adds one more. So yes, 49 is correct for 8's in the units place.\n\n**Counting 4's in the Tens Place:**\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4. So in each hundred, there's a block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. \n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49, 140-149, etc.). So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in the range 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so another 10 times. \n\nSo total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 more. So total 50.\n\n**Counting 8's in the Tens Place:**\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers every 100. So from 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nIn each of the four full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but 489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them except 488, which has 8 in both tens and units. Wait, no, 480 is 4-8-0, so the tens digit is 8. Similarly, 481 is 4-8-1, so tens digit is 8, and so on up to 488, which is 4-8-8. So that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So in the partial hundred, we have 9 instances.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in the tens place are 40 (from the four full hundreds) + 9 (from the partial hundred) = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 starting at 480. So 480 is included, and 488 is the last page. So how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? It's from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So 9 times. So yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n**Counting 4's in the Hundreds Place:**\nNow, moving to the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, right? Because 400 is the first number where the hundreds digit is 4, and 488 is the last.\n\nSo how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but hold on. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So yes, 89 times.\n\n**Counting 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\nNow, for the digit 8 in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\n**Now, let's sum up the counts for 4's and 8's:**\n\n- **Total 4's:**\n  - Units place: 48\n  - Tens place: 50\n  - Hundreds place: 89\n  - Total: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\n- **Total 8's:**\n  - Units place: 49\n  - Tens place: 49\n  - Hundreds place: 0\n  - Total: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because 48 + 50 + 89 is 187, and 49 + 49 is 98. So the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me go through each count again carefully.\n\n**Rechecking Units Place:**\n\n- For 4's: Every 10 numbers, one 4 in units place. From 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. So 48 times. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so no additional 4's. So units place 4's: 48.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, every 10 numbers, one 8 in units place. So 48 complete sets, 48 times. Then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in units place. So that's one more. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\n**Rechecking Tens Place:**\n\n- For 4's: In each hundred, 40-49 is 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So per hundred, 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So 4 * 10 = 40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\n- For 8's: In each hundred, 80-89 is 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So 4 * 10 = 40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\n**Rechecking Hundreds Place:**\n\n- For 4's: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with hundreds digit 4. So 89 times. Correct.\n\n- For 8's: There are no numbers from 800-899 in the book, so 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo adding up:\n\n- Total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nSo the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I counted 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, 48 for 4's and 49 for 8's. That's correct.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula or a different counting method to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place separately.\n\nFor a given digit d and place p (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor units place:\nNumber of times d appears = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nBut since we're dealing with digits, maybe it's better to think in terms of cycles.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate for each digit place.\n\nWait, but I think my initial method was correct. Let me just recount the 4's and 8's in each place.\n\n**Counting 4's Again:**\n\n- Units place: Every 10 numbers, 1 occurrence. 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, so 48 times. The last partial cycle (481-488) doesn't include a 4 in units, so total 48.\n\n- Tens place: In each hundred, 10 times. 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. Total 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's Again:**\n\n- Units place: Every 10 numbers, 1 occurrence. 488 /10=48 full cycles, so 48 times. The last partial cycle (481-488) includes 488, which has an 8 in units, so +1. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: In each hundred, 10 times. 4 hundreds contribute 4*10=40. In 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 40 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nDifference: 187 -98=89.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** 48 occurrences (once every 10 numbers, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 times).\n   - **Tens Place:** 50 occurrences (10 times per hundred for 4 hundreds, plus 10 in 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 89 occurrences (from 400-488, inclusive).\n\n   Total 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** 49 occurrences (48 from full cycles, plus 1 in 488).\n   - **Tens Place:** 49 occurrences (10 times per hundred for 4 hundreds, plus 9 in 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 0 occurrences (no pages 800-899).\n\n   Total 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** There are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should understand the problem clearly. Each page from 1 to 488 is printed once, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, let's start by thinking about how digits are counted in page numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nI think the best approach is to break down the problem by each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place (units, tens, hundreds), I'll calculate how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears, then sum them up across all places.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers. But wait, since we're starting from 1, the first page is 1, so 0 doesn't appear in the units place for the first few pages. Hmm, but when considering all page numbers up to 488, each digit from 0 to 9 will appear a certain number of times in each place.\n\nWait, actually, for the units place, every 10 consecutive numbers will have each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Then from 11 to 20, it's 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 again, and so on.\n\nBut since we're starting from 1, the first set from 1 to 10 doesn't have a 0 in the units place, but from 11 onwards, every block of 10 pages will have a 0 in the units place. Wait, no, actually, 10 is included, so the units digit does go from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, perhaps it's better to think of it as each digit from 0 to 9 appearing the same number of times in each place, except perhaps the last partial block.\n\nWait, but the total number of pages is 488, which is not a multiple of 10, so the last block (units place) will have 8 numbers, from 481 to 488, which would have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, the digits 0 through 9 each appear a certain number of times, but the last partial block might not complete the 10 digits.\n\nSo, to calculate the number of times a digit appears in the units place, I can divide the total number of pages by 10 to get the number of complete blocks, each contributing one occurrence of the digit, and then check the remainder to see if the digit appears in the incomplete block.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), I'll compute the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10: 488 // 10 = 48 blocks, each contributing one occurrence of each digit in the units place.\n\nSo, for each digit from 0 to 9, they appear 48 times in the units place. But wait, 48 * 10 = 480, so pages 1 to 480 have 48 complete blocks, and then pages 481 to 488, which is 8 more pages.\n\nIn the units place, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, digits 1 through 8 appear once more, and 9 and 0 do not appear in this partial block.\n\nTherefore, for the units place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 48 times (from the complete blocks) plus 1 time in the partial block, totaling 49 times.\n- Digit 8 appears 48 times plus 1 time, totaling 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, in the partial block, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once. So, yes, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 1 to 480, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, so digits 1 through 8 each get an extra count. Therefore, digits 4 and 8 each get 48 + 1 = 49 in the units place.\n\nOkay, so units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in cycles of 100. Each 100 pages will have 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages.\n\nBut since our total is 488 pages, which is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, let's see.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (since 400 pages). Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for each digit, 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nThen, we have 88 pages remaining (from 401 to 488). Let's analyze the tens place in these 88 pages.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 9 every 10 pages. Let's see:\n\n- Pages 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- Pages 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- Pages 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- Pages 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- Pages 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- Pages 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- Pages 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- Pages 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- Pages 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but there are only 8 pages (481 to 488). So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place in these 88 pages?\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nFrom 401-488, that's 88 pages, which is 8 full tens blocks (each 10 pages) and an extra 8 pages.\n\nWait, no, 88 pages can be broken into 8 full tens (each 10 pages) and 8 extra pages. So, the tens digits from 0 to 7 each appear once (for 10 pages each), and then the tens digit 8 appears for 8 pages (481-488).\n\nWait, but let's count how many times each digit appears in the tens place from 401 to 488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: pages 401-410 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 1: pages 411-420 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 2: pages 421-430 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 3: pages 431-440 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 4: pages 441-450 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 5: pages 451-460 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 6: pages 461-470 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 7: pages 471-480 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 8: pages 481-488 \u2192 8 pages\n\nSo, each digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place from 401 to 488.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450)\n- Digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488)\n\nBut wait, we also have the complete hundreds before 400. Each hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, for each digit, in the first 400 pages, each digit appears 4 * 10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, no, actually, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences per digit in the tens place. So, from 1-100, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, from 101-200, same, and so on up to 400. So, for each digit, in the tens place, from 1-400, each digit appears 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nThen, from 401-488, as we calculated, digit 4 appears 10 times, and digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, with 0 appearing in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, etc., up to 8 in 481-488. So, each digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 times\n- Digit 8: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48 times\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears, since the book has 488 pages. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- Digit 1: from 100-199 \u2192 100 pages \u2192 100 times\n- Digit 2: from 200-299 \u2192 100 pages \u2192 100 times\n- Digit 3: from 300-399 \u2192 100 pages \u2192 100 times\n- Digit 4: from 400-488 \u2192 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n\nWait, let me confirm: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 89 times\n- Digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488. So, digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nStarting with digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nNow, digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times\n\nWait, but let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each complete block of 10 pages contributes 1 occurrence of each digit in the units place. So, 488 // 10 = 48 blocks, each contributing 1, so 48 times. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so digit 4 and 8 each appear once more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- From 1-400: each digit appears 40 times (4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times)\n- From 401-488:\n  - Tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages\n  - Tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages\nSo, total for 4: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal for 8: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears in 400-488: 89 times\n- 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place\n\nSo, total for 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal for 8: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for digit 4. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: 400 is page 400, and 488 is page 488. So, that's 89 pages. So, hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit for 481-488 is 8, and that's 8 pages. So, digit 8 in the tens place gets 8 more counts, making it 40 + 8 = 48. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, digit 4 in the tens place from 401-488 is from 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that from 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nEach of these blocks except the last one has 10 pages. The last block, 481-488, has 8 pages. So, yes, each digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450), so total 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50.\n\nDigit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place (from 481-488), so total 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, summing up:\n\nDigit 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nDigit 8: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't count. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, 200-299 is 2, 300-399 is 3, and 400-488 is 4. So, digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times, correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about the hundreds digit: the number of times a digit d appears in the hundreds place is equal to the number of complete hundreds blocks plus any partial block if applicable. But in this case, since we're only up to 488, the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, and only 4 appears in the hundreds place beyond 400.\n\nWait, but I think my calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97, so 188 - 97 = 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just cross-verify by considering another approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately.\n\nAlternatively, I can write down the counts again:\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each place. Maybe using the formula where for each digit place, you calculate how many times each digit appears by considering higher digits and lower digits.\n\nBut perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, I can think about how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check my counts again to be thorough.\n\nLet me start with the units place again.\n\nTotal pages: 488\n\nNumber of complete decades (groups of 10): 488 // 10 = 48. So, 48 complete decades, each contributing one occurrence of each digit in the units place. So, digits 0-9 each appear 48 times in the units place.\n\nThen, the remaining pages: 488 % 10 = 8 pages. These are pages 481-488, with units digits 1-8. So, digits 1-8 each get an extra count, making their total in the units place 48 + 1 = 49, while digits 9 and 0 remain at 48.\n\nSo, digit 4: 49\nDigit 8: 49\n\nThat's correct.\n\nNow, tens place.\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, from 1-400, each digit appears 4 * 10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 401-488, we have 88 pages. Let's see how the tens digit progresses:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nEach of the first eight blocks (401-410 to 471-480) has 10 pages, contributing one occurrence of each digit from 0 to 7 in the tens place. The last block, 481-488, has 8 pages, contributing one occurrence of 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, digits 0-7 each get 10 more counts in the tens place, and digit 8 gets 8 more counts.\n\nThus, in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\n- Digit 8: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nThat's correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no counts.\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit 1, 100 times\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit 2, 100 times\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit 3, 100 times\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit 4, 89 times\n\nSo, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, total for 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal for 8: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nHmm, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me just think if I considered all the cases correctly. For example, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, is that 89 pages? Let me compute 488 - 400 + 1 = 89, yes.\n\nAnother way: 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages, correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97, so there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 97 times. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a number from 1 to 488, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. I'll handle each place one by one because the occurrence of a digit can vary depending on the place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit, like 4 or 8, appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's would be the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, giving 48 groups. Each group contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. But wait, there's a remainder of 8 pages after 480. So, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. In this range, does 4 appear? Yes, at 484. So that's one more 4. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more 8. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so for units place, both 4's and 8's occur 49 times each. So the difference here is zero. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49), and similarly for 8, it's 80-89, ten times.\n\nSo, first, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-400) plus 88 pages. So, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for each hundred, 10 times 4 and 10 times 8.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-400). Each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40 for each digit.\n\nNow, what about the remaining 88 pages (401-488)? Let's look at the tens digit here. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Specifically, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit for 481-488 is 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449. So, that's 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488? It's in the range 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. Wait, no, actually, each ten's place is a single digit, so from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers? From 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each, so that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The tens digit is determined by the second digit from the right. So, for 480, it's 8; 481, it's 8; up to 488, it's 8. So that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place: 4 full hundreds contribute 40, plus 10 from the last partial hundred, so 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 4 full hundreds contribute 40, plus 9 from the last partial hundred, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's occur 50 times, and 8's occur 49 times. The difference here is 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it changes less frequently. For 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist or is 0, so we can ignore that. From 100 onwards, the hundreds digit becomes 1, then 2, etc.\n\nIn our case, the book has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes from 1 (for 100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488).\n\nSo, let's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. It's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. The difference here is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. Difference: 0.\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49. Difference: +1.\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. Difference: +89.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each place to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages = 488.\n\nNumber of complete decades (groups of 10) = 488 // 10 = 48. Each contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each.\n\nThen, the remaining pages: 488 % 10 = 8. So, pages 481-488.\n\nIn these, the units digits are 1-8. So, does 4 appear? Yes, at 484. So, one more 4. Similarly, 8 appears at 488. So, one more 8.\n\nSo, units place: 48 + 1 = 49, 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of complete centuries (groups of 100) = 4 (since 4*100 = 400). Each century contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10 = 40 each.\n\nRemaining pages: 488 - 400 = 88. So, from 401-488.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). \n\nFor 4 in the tens place: occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times.\n\nThus, total tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 9 = 49. Difference of +1. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 or non-existent, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, same.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, same.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's.\n\nFor 8's in hundreds place: since 800 is beyond 488, no occurrences. So, 0.\n\nThus, hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's. Difference of +89.\n\nAdding up the differences: units (0) + tens (+1) + hundreds (+89) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility I'm missing something? For example, when considering the tens place in the last partial hundred, did I correctly count the number of times 8 appears? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 times. Correct.\n\nAnother point: when calculating the hundreds place, I considered only the hundreds digit. So, that's correct because we're looking for the digit 4 or 8 in any place, and the hundreds place is only affected by the hundreds digit.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all digit places correctly. The problem is about page numbers, which can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit.\n\nIn single-digit pages (1-9), the digits are only in the units place. So, in the units place, we've already considered all digits, including these single-digit pages.\n\nIn two-digit pages (10-99), both units and tens digits are present. So, in our earlier calculation, we included all two-digit numbers in the units and tens place counts.\n\nIn three-digit pages (100-488), all three digit places are present. So, we've included hundreds, tens, and units in our counts.\n\nTherefore, I think the counts are accurate.\n\nSo, total number of 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's a lot. Let me confirm:\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 50\n\nHundreds: 89\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 49\n\nHundreds: 0\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Correct.\n\nAnd no 8's in hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488. So, 0.\n\nIn the tens place, we have 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nIn the units place, 49 each.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the tens place for the last partial hundred.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 4's in tens place.\n\nAnd the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in tens place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother check: total number of digits printed.\n\nEach page from 1-9: 1 digit each, total 9 digits.\n\nFrom 10-99: 2 digits each, total 90 pages, so 180 digits.\n\nFrom 100-488: 3 digits each, total 389 pages, so 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, total number of 4's: 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's: 98.\n\nSo, total 4's + 8's = 188 + 98 = 286.\n\nWhich is less than 1356, so that seems plausible.\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach to verify. Maybe using a formula or another counting method.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, 488 // 10 = 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each.\n\nThen, the remainder is 8, so from 481-488, units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (at 484), and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units total: 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\n488 // 100 = 4 full centuries, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 each.\n\nThen, the remainder is 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n\nFor 4 in tens place: occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\nFor 8 in tens place: occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, tens total: 4's = 40 +10=50, 8's=40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n488 // 1000 = 0 full thousands, so nothing here.\n\nBut since we have 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nSo, 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a different method, like considering each digit place separately and using the formula for digit frequency.\n\nFor a given digit d and position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times d appears can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet n be the number, which is 488.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times d appears = (n + 9 - d) // 10.\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly accurate. The formula is a bit more involved.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times a digit appears in the units place up to n is floor(n/10) + (1 if the last digit >= d else 0), but considering d=4 and d=8.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the method I used earlier, as it seems to give a consistent result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in Each Digit Place:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - For every 10 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears once in the units place.\n     - Total complete decades: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.\n     - Each contributes one 4 and one 8.\n     - Remainder: 88 \u00f7 10 = 8, so pages 481-488.\n     - In these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n     - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n     - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - For every 100 pages, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n     - Total complete centuries: 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.\n     - Each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n     - Remainder: 488 - 400 = 88 pages (401-488).\n     - In the tens place:\n       - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n       - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - **Total 4's in tens place:** 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n     - **Total 8's in tens place:** 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n     - 8 never appears in the hundreds place within 488.\n     - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89.\n     - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n2. **Summing Up the Counts:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n   \n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Total 4's - Total 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. Each page from 1 to 488 is printed once, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are counted in numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I need to consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both 4's and 8's.\n\nI'll approach this by separately counting the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll sum them up and find the difference.\n\nStarting with the 4's:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit is 4 exactly once. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - How many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. Each of these sets contributes 1 four in the units place. So, 48 fours.\n   - Wait, but 488 is the last page. The last complete set would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 appears once more at 484. Hmm, wait, 484 is within 488, so that's included in the 48 sets. Wait, no, because 484 is 48*10 + 4, so it's the 49th occurrence? Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many there are, I can take (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 fours in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page. So, 484 is the last one ending with 4 before 488. So, yes, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place.\n   - How many such blocks are there up to 488?\n   - Let's see: 0-99: 40-49 (10 fours)\n   - 100-199: 140-149 (10 fours)\n   - 200-299: 240-249 (10 fours)\n   - 300-399: 340-349 (10 fours)\n   - 400-488: 440-449 (10 fours) but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10.\n   - So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, each with 4 in the tens place, so 10 fours. Similarly, each subsequent block adds another 10. So, up to 440-449, that's 5 blocks, so 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in the range 400-488.\n   - How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers.\n   - Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, summing up the fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, the units digit is 8. How many numbers from 1 to 488 end with 8?\n   - The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488.\n   - The last one is 488, which is 8 in the units place.\n   - So, how many terms? Let's compute (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\nWait, but wait: 488 is included, so yes, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Now, the tens digit is 8. This occurs in blocks of 100, specifically in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489.\n   - But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, each block contributes 10 eights except the last one, which contributes 9.\n   - Let's count the blocks:\n     - 80-89: 10 eights\n     - 180-189: 10 eights\n     - 280-289: 10 eights\n     - 380-389: 10 eights\n     - 480-488: 9 eights\n   - So, total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8. This occurs in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, summing up the eights:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with fours:\n\n- Units: 49. That's because from 4, 14, ..., 484. Let me check: 484 is 48*10 +4, so that's the 49th occurrence. Correct.\n- Tens: 50. Because 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 blocks, each giving 10 fours. 5*10=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 89. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 +89=188. That seems right.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units: 49. From 8, 18, ..., 488. 488 is included, so 49. Correct.\n- Tens: 49. Because 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, all within 488, so that's fine.\n\nWait, another way to think about the hundreds place for fours: from 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n### Counting the number of 4's:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit is 4 in numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - There are \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\) occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 4 in blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488.\n   - There are \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\) occurrences.\n\nTotal number of 4's: \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n### Counting the number of 8's:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit is 8 in numbers 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - There are \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\) occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last block, which contributes 9.\n   - Total: \\( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 \\) occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal number of 8's: \\( 49 + 49 = 98 \\).\n\n### Difference:\nThe number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488, and each page number is printed once. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, so maybe I should start by considering how digits are distributed in page numbers. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, or even 4-digit numbers, but since the book only has 488 pages, the highest page number is 488, which is a 3-digit number. So, I don't need to worry about 4-digit numbers here.\n\nLet me break down the page numbers into 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers to make it easier.\n\n1-digit page numbers: These are from 1 to 9. So, pages 1 through 9.\n\n2-digit page numbers: From 10 to 99.\n\n3-digit page numbers: From 100 to 488.\n\nI think it's best to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each category separately and then add them up.\n\nLet's start with the 1-digit page numbers.\n\n1-digit numbers (1-9):\n- The digit 4 appears once, which is on page 4.\n- The digit 8 appears once, which is on page 8.\n\nSo, for 1-digit numbers, count_4 = 1 and count_8 = 1.\n\nNow, moving on to 2-digit numbers (10-99). Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNext, the units digit. For each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 groups (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, total 4's in 2-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8:\n\nTens place: 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nUnits place: In each ten's group, the digit 8 appears once. So, 9 groups, 9 times.\n\nTotal 8's in 2-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in 2-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nBut let me double-check. For 4's in the tens place: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Correct. For the units place, in each ten's group (like 14, 24, ..., 94), that's 9 numbers because 04 isn't a 2-digit number. Wait, no, 04 is just 4, which is a 1-digit number. So, in 2-digit numbers, units digits can be 0-9, but the tens digit is 1-9. So, for units digit 4, from 10-99, it's 9 times. So, 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Same for 8's. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to 3-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is where it might get a bit more complicated because we have hundreds, tens, and units places. So, I need to consider each place separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet me structure this by considering each digit place: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. For 3-digit numbers, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but 4 only goes up to 488, not 499.\n\nWait, so let me correct that. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens and units digits are limited because the maximum page is 488.\n\nSo, perhaps I should handle the hundreds digit as 1, 2, 3, and 4 separately.\n\nBut maybe it's better to split the 3-digit numbers into two parts: 100-399 and 400-488. That might make it easier because 100-399 have hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, but with some constraints.\n\nWait, actually, 100-399: hundreds digits 1, 2, 3.\n\n400-488: hundreds digit 4, but the tens and units digits are limited.\n\nI think splitting it this way might help avoid confusion.\n\nSo, let's first handle 100-399.\n\nHundreds place: 1, 2, 3.\n\nNow, for each of these, we can consider how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens and units places.\n\nWait, but the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so it doesn't affect the count of 4's or 8's in the hundreds place unless the digit itself is 4 or 8. Since 1, 2, 3 are the hundreds digits, they don't contribute to 4's or 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, for 100-399, we can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the tens and units places.\n\nSimilarly, for 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that contributes to the count of 4's in the hundreds place. Also, the tens and units digits are from 0-8 and 0-8 respectively, except for 488 where the tens digit is 8 and units digit is 8.\n\nWait, no, 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 0-8, and the units digit can be 0-9, except when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 0-8, and for each tens digit, the units digit can be 0-9 except when the tens digit is 8, then the units digit can only go up to 8, because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is the last page, so pages 480-488 are included. So, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8, making the last page 488. So, for tens digit 8, units digits are 0-8, which is 9 numbers.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, right? 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 pages.\n\nSo, for the 400-488 range, we have:\n\n- Hundreds digit: 4, which appears once per number, so for 400-488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, each of these 89 numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to count how many 4's and 8's are in the page numbers, so the hundreds digit being 4 contributes 89 4's. Now, for the tens and units digits in 400-488, I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens and units places.\n\nLet me handle this step by step.\n\nFirst, for 400-488:\n\nHundreds digit: 4, contributing 89 4's.\n\nNow, for the tens digit:\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, for each tens digit, how many times does 4 appear, and how many times does 8 appear?\n\nSimilarly, for the units digit.\n\nLet me start with the tens digit.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit ranges from 0 to 8.\n\nFor each tens digit, the number of times it appears is as follows:\n\n- For tens digit 0: pages 400-409, so 10 numbers.\n- For tens digit 1: 410-419, 10 numbers.\n- ...\n- For tens digit 7: 470-479, 10 numbers.\n- For tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0 to 7, there are 10 numbers, and for 8, there are 9.\n\nNow, how many times does 4 appear in the tens digit?\n\nLooking at tens digits 0-8, the digit 4 appears once in the tens place for the range 440-449. So, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Only in the range 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units digit in 400-488.\n\nThe units digit can be 0-9 for each tens digit, except when the tens digit is 8, where the units digit goes up to 8.\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0-7, the units digit cycles through 0-9, which is 10 possibilities. For tens digit 8, units digit is 0-8, which is 9 possibilities.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit?\n\nFor each tens digit from 0-7, the units digit 4 appears once per ten's group, so 8 times (since there are 8 tens digits from 0-7). Each contributes 10 numbers, but the units digit 4 appears once in each ten's group, so 8 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. For each ten's group (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0-9, so in each ten's group, the units digit 4 appears once. Since there are 8 ten's groups where the tens digit is 0-7, that's 8 times. But wait, no, actually, there are 8 ten's groups (tens digits 0-7), each contributing 1 occurrence of units digit 4, so 8 times. But wait, 480-488 is another ten's group where the units digit can only go up to 8, so in that group, units digit 4 appears once as well, because 484 is within 480-488.\n\nWait, so for the tens digit 8, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included. So, that's another occurrence of 4 in the units place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in the units place in 400-488 is 8 (from tens digits 0-7) + 1 (from tens digit 8) = 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nIn each ten's group from 0-7, the units digit 8 appears once, so 8 times.\n\nIn the tens digit 8 group (480-488), the units digit 8 appears once as well, which is 488.\n\nSo, total 8's in the units place: 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: For each ten's group (0-7), units digit 8 appears once, so 8 times. Then in the 80-88 group, units digit 8 appears once as 488. So, total 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is a ten's group where the tens digit is 8, and the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, yes, units digit 8 appears once here.\n\nSo, putting it all together for 400-488:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's (since each of the 89 numbers has a hundreds digit of 4).\n- Tens place: 10 4's and 9 8's.\n- Units place: 9 4's and 9 8's.\n\nWait, hold on, no. Wait, in the tens place, for 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449), and the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 4 occurs 9 times and 8 occurs 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in 400-488:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 10\n- Units place: 9\nTotal: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108.\n\nSimilarly, total 8's in 400-488:\n\n- Tens place: 9\n- Units place: 9\nTotal: 9 + 9 = 18.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. So, hundreds place contributes 89 4's, tens place 10, units place 9, so 89 + 10 + 9 = 108 4's.\n\nFor 8's, only in tens and units places: 9 + 9 = 18.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Because when I'm counting the hundreds place for 4's, it's 89, which is correct because each of the 89 numbers from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. Then, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and in the units place, 4 appears 9 times. So, total 4's: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. In the units place, 8 appears 9 times as well, so total 18 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the 100-399 range.\n\nIn this range, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3. So, the hundreds digit doesn't contribute to 4's or 8's. So, we only need to consider the tens and units places.\n\nLet me structure this similarly to how I did for 400-488.\n\nIn 100-399, the hundreds digit is fixed as 1, 2, or 3. So, for each hundreds digit, the tens and units digits can range from 0-9, except that for 300-399, the hundreds digit is 3, but that doesn't affect the count of 4's or 8's.\n\nWait, no, the hundreds digit being 1, 2, or 3 doesn't contribute to 4's or 8's, so we can treat each hundred's group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) separately.\n\nSo, for each hundred's group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens and units digits can be 00-99, so each group has 100 numbers.\n\nWait, but 100-199 is 100 numbers, same for 200-299, and 300-399.\n\nSo, for each of these three hundred's groups, the tens and units digits each cycle through 0-9, 10 times each for each digit.\n\nSo, for each hundred's group, how many times does 4 appear in the tens and units places?\n\nIn the tens place: For each hundred's group, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349).\n\nSimilarly, in the units place: For each hundred's group, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten's group, so 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194 in 100-199).\n\nSo, for each hundred's group, 4's in tens place: 10, and 4's in units place: 10, so total 20 4's per hundred's group.\n\nSince there are three hundred's groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), total 4's in 100-399 would be 3 * 20 = 60.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred's group, 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n\nIn the units place, 8 appears 10 times per hundred's group (e.g., 108, 118, ..., 198 in 100-199).\n\nSo, per hundred's group, 10 + 10 = 20 8's.\n\nThree hundred's groups, so 3 * 20 = 60 8's.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, in 100-399:\n\n- 4's: 60\n- 8's: 60\n\nNow, let's summarize all the counts so far.\n\n1-digit numbers (1-9):\n\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\n2-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\n3-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-399:\n  - 4's: 60\n  - 8's: 60\n\n- 400-488:\n  - 4's: 108\n  - 8's: 18\n\nWait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, when I calculated 400-488, I got 108 4's and 18 8's. But let me check again.\n\nWait, in 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4, so 89 4's.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nIn the units place, 4 appears 9 times (once in each ten's group except the last one, which is 480-488, where 484 is included) and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in 400-488:\n\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Tens: 10\n- Units: 9\nTotal: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108\n\nTotal 8's in 400-488:\n\n- Tens: 9\n- Units: 9\nTotal: 18\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n1-digit: 1\n\n2-digit: 19\n\n3-digit:\n\n100-399: 60\n\n400-488: 108\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 60 + 108 = 190 - Wait, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 60 is 80, plus 108 is 188. Hmm, 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 60 = 80, 80 + 108 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, total 8's:\n\n1-digit: 1\n\n2-digit: 19\n\n3-digit:\n\n100-399: 60\n\n400-488: 18\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 60 + 18 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\n1-digit: 1\n\n2-digit: 19\n\n100-399: 60\n\n400-488: 18\n\nSo, 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 60 = 80, 80 + 18 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\n\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so the answer would be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 1-digit:\n\n4: 1\n\n8: 1\n\n2-digit:\n\n4: 19\n\n8: 19\n\n3-digit:\n\n100-399:\n\n4: 60\n\n8: 60\n\n400-488:\n\n4: 108\n\n8: 18\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 60 + 108 = 188\n\n8's: 1 + 19 + 60 + 18 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't overcount in the 400-488 range.\n\nIn 400-488, hundreds digit 4: 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nUnits digit 4: In each ten's group from 400-488, except the last one, units digit 4 appears once. So, from 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, that's 8 ten's groups, each contributing 1 4 in the units place, so 8. Plus, in 480-488, units digit 4 is at 484, so that's 1 more. So, total 9.\n\nSo, 89 + 10 + 9 = 108 4's in 400-488.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nUnits digit 8: In each ten's group from 400-479, units digit 8 appears once, so 8 times. Plus, in 480-488, units digit 8 appears once at 488. So, total 9.\n\nSo, 9 + 9 = 18 8's in 400-488.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 60 (100-399) + 108 (400-488) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 60 = 80; 80 + 108 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\n1 + 19 + 60 + 18 = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 60 = 80; 80 + 18 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or a digit-by-digit analysis.\n\nAnother approach is to consider each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately across all page numbers from 1 to 488 and count the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nTotal number of complete blocks of 10 in 488 numbers is 48 (since 48*10=480), with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nSo, in each block, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Plus, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total units digit 4's: 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place:\n\nSame calculation: 48 times in complete blocks, plus in the last 8 numbers, 8 appears once at 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. Wait, earlier I had 9 4's in units place in 400-488, but this method is giving me 48 4's in units place from 1-488. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, perhaps this approach is incorrect because it's counting from 1-488, but in my initial approach, I broke it down into 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and so on. Maybe I confused the counts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use this digit-by-digit approach to cross-verify.\n\nLet me try this:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIn each group of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. The number of complete groups of 10 in 488 is 48 (since 48*10=480). So, 48 times. Plus, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\nEach group of 10 has one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Plus, in the last 8 numbers, 488 has 8 in the units place, so total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each group of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for the tens digit 4 in 401-488, it appears 10 times (440-449). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nIn each 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nIn 1-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place:\n\nIn 1-488, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book only goes up to 488. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, summing up all digit places:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 188 4's. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so according to this digit-by-digit approach, total 4's are 187, and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nBut in my initial approach, I had 188 4's and 98 8's, so a difference of 90.\n\nHmm, so which is correct?\n\nI must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check both methods.\n\nIn the initial approach, I broke it down into 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and then 100-399 and 400-488. Let me recount the 4's in that method.\n\n1-digit numbers: 1-9.\n\n4's: 1 (page 4).\n\n2-digit numbers: 10-99.\n\n4's: 19.\n\n3-digit numbers:\n\n100-399: 60.\n\n400-488: 108.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 60 + 108 = 188.\n\nBut in the digit-by-digit approach, it's 187. So, where's the mistake?\n\nWait, in the digit-by-digit approach, units place 4's: 48, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nBut in the initial approach, I had 188. So, perhaps I overcounted by 1 somewhere.\n\nLet me check the units place in the initial approach.\n\nIn the initial approach, I considered 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers. For units place 4's:\n\n1-digit: 1\n\n2-digit: 9 (units place 4 in 14,24,...,94)\n\n3-digit:\n\n100-399: 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 units place 4's, so 3*10=30.\n\n400-488: units place 4's: 9 (as I thought earlier).\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 1 + 9 + 30 + 9 = 50.\n\nWait, but in the digit-by-digit approach, units place 4's are 48. So, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I might have double-counted some units place 4's.\n\nWait, in 1-digit numbers, units place 4 is page 4.\n\nIn 2-digit numbers, units place 4's are 14,24,...,94, which is 9 numbers.\n\nIn 100-399, units place 4's: 10 per hundred, so 3*10=30.\n\nIn 400-488, units place 4's: 9.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 1 + 9 + 30 + 9 = 50.\n\nBut in the digit-by-digit approach, it's 48. So, why the difference?\n\nWait, perhaps because in the digit-by-digit approach, we're counting from 1-488, so perhaps the initial approach is overcounting.\n\nWait, let me think. When I count units place 4's in 1-digit numbers as 1, that's correct. In 2-digit numbers, 14,24,...,94: 9 numbers, correct. In 100-399, 10 per hundred, so 3*10=30, correct. In 400-488, units place 4's: 9, correct.\n\nSo, 1 + 9 + 30 + 9 = 50.\n\nBut in the digit-by-digit approach, it's 48. So, perhaps the digit-by-digit approach is missing something.\n\nWait, let me recount the digit-by-digit approach.\n\nUnits place 4's: 48.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, it's 50.\n\nWait, perhaps in the digit-by-digit approach, I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the digit-by-digit approach, units place 4's: 48.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, it's 50. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me list the units place 4's:\n\nFrom 1-9: 4.\n\nFrom 10-99: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: 9 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-399: Each hundred has 10 units place 4's, so 3*10=30.\n\nFrom 400-488: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484: 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 1 + 9 + 30 + 9 = 50.\n\nSo, the digit-by-digit approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, in the digit-by-digit approach, I said that from 1-488, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place, so 48 times, and in the last 8 numbers, 481-488, there's no 4 in units place, so 48 total.\n\nBut according to the initial approach,"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should understand what the problem is asking. It says each page number is printed once, starting from page 1 up to page 488. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nHmm, okay, so I think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately\u2014units place, tens place, hundreds place\u2014and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place. Then, sum them up for each digit and find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. \n\nBut wait, our book has 488 pages, so the last page is 488, which is a three-digit number. So, the units digit cycles 0-9, 0-9, and so on. Let me calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages.\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages (from 481 to 488). So, in each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. Therefore, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48.\n\nBut wait, there are 8 extra pages beyond the 480th page. These are pages 481 to 488. So, let me check the units digits in these 8 pages. The units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the digit 4 appears once (page 484), and the digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, it's 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so pages 481-488 are 8 pages, and their units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, 4 appears once and 8 appears once in the units place in the extra pages.\n\nSo, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nWait, but that seems like they are equal, so the difference from units place is zero. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake because 488 is the last page, so in the units place, from 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears equally except maybe for the last incomplete set, but in this case, the incomplete set is 8 pages, so digits 1-8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once and 8 appears once, as I thought.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, right? Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. Then from 100-199, it's the same, and so on.\n\nSo, the total number of pages is 488, which is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, let me break it down:\n\n- Pages 1-99: Here, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each, but since we start at 1, the first 10 pages (1-10) have a tens digit of 0, but maybe I should think of it as 00-99 for easier calculation. Wait, maybe it's better to consider each hundred separately.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place from 1 to 488.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. Wait, no, I'm focusing on the tens place right now.\n\nSo, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nNow, let's see how many hundreds we have in 488 pages. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages beyond that (401-488).\n\nSo, in each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 8 in the tens place would also appear 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the incomplete hundred from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 4-8-8). So, the tens digits in this range are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). Wait, but 488 is page 488, so the tens digit here is 8, and it goes from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 and 8 appear in this partial hundred?\n\nLooking at the tens digits:\n\n- For tens digit 4: It appears in pages 441-450, which is 10 pages. But wait, in the range 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times here.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because in the range 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so the tens digit 8 occurs in pages 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nSo, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total tens digit counts:\n\n- For 4: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the partial hundred, so 50 times.\n\n- For 8: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 8 in the partial hundred, so 48 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. In each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, 10 times for each digit. So, 4 hundreds give 40 for each digit. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal tens digit 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 48 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the incomplete hundred, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears only 8 times. So, for the tens digit 4, it's 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 have a hundreds digit of 0, which we can ignore since we're counting digits 4 and 8. Pages 100-199 have a hundreds digit of 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only in pages 400-488. So, how many times does the hundreds digit 4 appear? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (including both 400 and 488). Wait, no: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. But wait, no, because each page has the hundreds digit as 4, so each of those 89 pages contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, does the hundreds digit ever equal 8? In a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is page 488, which is in the 400s, so the hundreds digit is 4, not 8. So, yes, the hundreds digit 8 never appears because the book doesn't go up to 800 pages. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears zero times.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFirst, let's list the counts:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 49\n  - 8's: 49\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 50\n  - 8's: 48\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's add them up for each digit.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me go back step by step.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place except possibly the last partial set.\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of complete sets of 10: 488 // 10 = 48 sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 each.\n\nRemaining pages: 488 % 10 = 8 pages, which are 481 to 488. Their units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\nThus, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's; 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit.\n\nNow, the incomplete hundred: 401-488.\n\nIn the tens place, digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488).\n\nSo, for each tens digit:\n\n- 4: occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, 10 times.\n\n- 8: occurs in 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, 8 times.\n\nThus, in the incomplete hundred, 10 4's and 8 8's.\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so each page contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. The number of pages here is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 4's.\n\nNo pages have 8 in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, which is in the 400's. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n4's: 89.\n\n8's: 0.\n\nNow, adding them all up:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me think again. 91 more 4's than 8's. Hmm.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be too high. Let me check the counts again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89, which is correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 48, so 2 more 4's there.\n\nIn the units place, both are 49, so no difference.\n\nSo, 89 (hundreds) + 2 (tens) = 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by calculating the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nCalculating number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: As before, 49.\n\n- Tens place: 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49.\n\n- Tens place: 48.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the incomplete hundred. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is a significant contribution.\n\nSo, the difference is 91.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many pages are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, each of these pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place, and 0 8's.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nSo, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the difference seems quite large, but I think the calculations are correct. The hundreds place contributes a lot because all pages from 400 to 488 have a 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 times, while 8's don't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place.\n- 48 complete sets of 10 pages: 48 4's and 48 8's.\n- Remaining 8 pages (481-488): 1 4 and 1 8.\n- Total: 49 4's, 49 8's.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred.\n- 4 complete hundreds: 40 4's, 40 8's.\n- Incomplete hundred (401-488):\n  - 4's: 10 times (441-450).\n  - 8's: 8 times (481-488).\n- Total: 50 4's, 48 8's.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 400-488: 89 pages with 4 in the hundreds place.\n- No 8's in the hundreds place.\n- Total: 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n- 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **91**.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should probably understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a number from 1 to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the problem into smaller parts. I think it's easier to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. That way, I can handle each position one by one without missing any numbers.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, same with the digit 8. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each of these 48 sets, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. That gives 48 times each. \n\nBut wait, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 8 appears once more in the units place (page 488), but the digit 4 doesn't appear in the units place here because the units digits go up to 8. So, for the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 and the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check that. From 1-480, there are 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8. So, the digit 4 doesn't appear in the units place here because 484 would be 484, but wait, 484 is within 481-488. Hmm, actually, 484 is in that range, so the units digit is 4. So, I was wrong earlier. \n\nWait, so in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, actually, both 4 and 8 appear once more in the units place in this last partial set. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's. So, both have 49 in the units place. \n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me make sure. Let's take a smaller example to test. Suppose we have 10 pages. So, from 1-10. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once. Now, if we have 18 pages, from 1-18. The units digits go from 1-8 twice (1-10 and 11-18). So, in each set of ten, 4 and 8 appear once. So, for 18 pages, 1 full set (10) and an extra 8. So, 4 appears once in the first set, and once in the second set (at 14). Similarly, 8 appears once in the first set and once in the second set (at 18). So, total 2 times each. So, the number of 4's and 8's in the units place is the same when the total number ends with a digit >=8. \n\nWait, so in the case of 488, which ends with 8, the number of complete sets is 48 (each of 10 pages), and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each complete set, 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. Then, in the extra 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, they are equal in the units place.\n\nOkay, so units place contributes equally to both 4's and 8's. So, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, the digits cycle every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). \n\nNow, let's see how many hundreds we have in 488. Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, we have four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-400) plus 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for the first 400 pages, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 hundreds * 10 = 40. Similarly, the number of 8's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, we need to check the remaining pages from 401-488. Let's see the tens digits here. Pages 401-488: the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490). But wait, 488 is less than 490, so the tens digit goes up to 8, but only up to 488.\n\nSo, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, but only 8 times because we stop at 488.\n\nWait, let me clarify. From 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers.\n\n411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, up to 481-490: tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's only 8 numbers (481-488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the last partial set.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- Tens digit 1: 10 times (411-420)\n- ...\n- Tens digit 7: 10 times (471-480)\n- Tens digit 8: 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nLooking for the digit 4 in the tens place: it occurs when the tens digit is 4, which is from 440-449. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 in the tens place occurs when the tens digit is 8, which is from 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8 numbers, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers (including both 480 and 488). Hmm, let me check: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last partial set.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens digit 8 was from 481-488, which would be 8 numbers, but that's incorrect. It's actually from 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 480 is included. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last partial set.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488:\n\n- 4's: 10 times (440-449)\n- 8's: 9 times (480-488)\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nThe total number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit cycles every 1000 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWait, actually, for page numbers 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, it's 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit can never be 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place in these page numbers.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89, and the number of 8's is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, we subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's:\n\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of ten numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of ten in 480 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contains 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - For 400 pages, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - **Total 4's from 1-400:** 4 * 10 = 40\n   - **Total 8's from 1-400:** 4 * 10 = 40\n   - From 401-488:\n     - 4's in tens place occur 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8's in tens place occur 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - The hundreds digit is never 8 in the range 1-488.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand what exactly the problem is asking. It says each page number is printed once, starting from 1 and ending at 488. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nAlright, so maybe I should approach this by looking at each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Since 488 is a three-digit number, the page numbers go up to three digits, so I need to consider all three places.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, same with the digit 8. So, if I can figure out how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nBut wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 blocks would give me 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they're equal.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, maybe the difference comes from the tens place or the hundreds place.\n\nLet me move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in each block of 100, same with 8.\n\nNow, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks of 100 and then 88 numbers left (401-488). So, in each complete block of 100, there are 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks would give me 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 numbers are from 401 to 488. Let's look at the tens place in these. The tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? Well, from 401-488, the tens digits go as follows:\n\n- 0: 401-410, which is 10 numbers, but since we're starting at 401, it's 401-410, so 10 numbers, but wait, 401-410 includes 401, 402,...,410, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 401-488 includes 401-488, which is 88 numbers. So, the tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, each digit appears 10 times except possibly the last one if the total isn't a multiple of 10.\n\nWait, but 88 divided by 10 is 8.8, so each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 9 times? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. For each tens digit, how many times does it appear? For example:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420: 10 numbers\n- ...\n- Tens digit 8: 481-490: but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 481-488 is 8 numbers.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, the tens digit 8 in the last partial block (481-488) only appears 8 times, not 10. So, for the tens place in 401-488:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times\n- Tens digit 8: appears 8 times\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? The tens digit 4 occurs when the tens place is 4, which is from 441-450. But wait, 441-450 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 441-450 is fully included, so 10 numbers. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in 401-488. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the tens digit 8 would appear 8 times because the last block is 481-488, but actually, the tens digit 8 in the tens place is from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but wait, 480 is included in 401-488, right? Wait, 480 is page 480, which is within 401-488. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). Wait, but 480 is page 480, which is in the tens place 8, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8, but maybe it's 9.\n\nWait, let me check: 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 401-488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding this to the complete blocks:\n\n- For 4's in tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the partial block, total 50\n- For 8's in tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the partial block, total 49\n\nWait, that's different from my initial thought. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, each complete block of 100 contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks give 40 each. Then, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 would have a hundreds digit of 4, right?\n\nSo, the hundreds digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-99, hundreds digit is 0 (since they're two-digit numbers), but in terms of page numbers, it's just 1-99, so the hundreds digit isn't printed. Wait, actually, page numbers from 1-99 are printed as one or two digits, so the hundreds place is only relevant from page 100 onwards.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (not printed)\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nHow about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, because 800 would be page 800, but the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, but never 8. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 to 4's and 1 to 8's, so 48 each.\n- The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, so 10 4's and 10 8's per block.\n- 4 blocks (1-400) give 40 each.\n- The partial block 401-488: tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- Tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 times.\n- So, tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 numbers, so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n- 8's in hundreds place: 0, since the book doesn't go beyond 488. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the tens place in the partial block. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, how many times does it appear?\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410 (10 numbers)\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420 (10)\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430 (10)\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440 (10)\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450 (10)\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460 (10)\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470 (10)\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480 (10)\n- Tens digit 8: 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488 (8 numbers)\n\nWait, so the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, not 9. Because 488 - 481 + 1 = 8. So, that would mean the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 9. So, in the tens place, 8's would be 40 (from complete blocks) + 8 (from partial block) = 48.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 9, but now I'm seeing it's 8. So, that changes things.\n\nLet me recalculate the tens place:\n\n- Complete blocks: 4 blocks * 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8\n- Partial block 401-488:\n  - Tens digit 4: 10 times (441-450)\n  - Tens digit 8: 8 times (481-488)\n- So, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nSo, that changes the total 8's in tens place to 48, not 49.\n\nSo, now, total 8's would be:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 = 97\n\nAnd 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, so I made a mistake earlier by thinking the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial block. It's actually 8 times because 481-488 is 8 numbers, not 9. So, the correct count for 8's in tens place is 48, making the total 8's 97, and the difference 91.\n\nWait, let me confirm the count for tens digit 8 in 401-488. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 is page 480, which is included in 401-488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused. Is it 8 or 9 times?\n\nWait, 480 is included in 401-488, so 480 is page 480, which is part of the partial block. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, the correct count is 9 times for the tens digit 8 in the partial block. So, the earlier calculation was correct with 48 in the tens place for 8's, but now I'm seeing it's 9, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake in the initial correction. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the partial block 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. Therefore, in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nSo, the total 8's in tens place is 49, making the total 8's as 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, so I think my initial correction was wrong. The correct count for the tens digit 8 in the partial block is 9, so 4's in tens place: 50, 8's: 49. So, the total 8's is 98, and the difference is 90.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the numbers in the partial block. So, to avoid confusion, let's approach it systematically.\n\nFor the tens place in 401-488:\n\n- The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except possibly the last one if the total isn't a multiple of 10.\n\nWait, but 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 numbers. 88 divided by 10 is 8.8, meaning that the first 8 tens digits (0-7) each appear 10 times, and the 9th tens digit (8) appears 8 times? No, that doesn't make sense because 8*10 = 80, leaving 8 more numbers, which would be the 9th tens digit (8) appearing 8 times.\n\nWait, but that would mean from 401-488, the tens digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, in that case, the tens digit 8 would appear 8 times in the partial block.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier count where 480-488 is 9 numbers. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many times each tens digit appears in 401-488.\n\nLet's list the ranges:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10)\n- 481-490: tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nSo, in this breakdown, the tens digit 8 appears only 8 times in the partial block. Therefore, in the tens place, 4's appear 10 times (from 441-450), and 8's appear 8 times (from 481-488).\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from complete blocks) + 8 = 48\n\nWait, but this contradicts the earlier count where I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, 481-488 is 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the partial block.\n\nBut wait, 480 is also part of the partial block, right? 480 is included in 401-488, so 480 is page 480, which has tens digit 8. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Let me check:\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that?\n\n480 is included, so 480 is the first number, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488: 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial block.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, 4's: 10, 8's: 9.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nThus, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think my confusion came from miscounting the numbers in the partial block. It's important to include 480 as part of the tens digit 8 in the partial block, making it 9 numbers, hence 9 occurrences of the tens digit 8.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u21d2 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 to 4's and 1 to 8's.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88 \u21d2 4 full blocks, each contributing 10 to both 4's and 8's.\n   - Remaining 88 numbers (401-488):\n     - 4's: 10 times (441-450)\n     - 8's: 9 times (480-488)\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's: 400-488 \u21d2 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n   - 8's: 0, as the book doesn't reach page 800.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem properly. Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nAlright, let's start by figuring out how to count the number of times a specific digit appears in a range of numbers. I remember that for such problems, it's helpful to break down the counting by each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds, etc.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488. That means the highest digit place we'll have to consider is the hundreds place, because 488 is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to consider the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's in each place.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, it's 4; from 11 to 20, it's 14; and so on.\n   - To find out how many times 4 appears in the units place up to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full blocks of 10, and then check if there's a remainder.\n   - Wait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). But since we're only concerned with the units digit, in each full block of 10, the 4 appears once. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times 1, which is 48. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40 to 49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers.\n   - So, let's see how many full hundreds we have in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n   - In each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 in the 400s. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, that's another 10 times.\n   - Therefore, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is only relevant for numbers 100 and above. In each block of 100, the hundreds digit is the same for all numbers in that block.\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 fours. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I considered 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10. So, 40+10=50. That seems right.\n\nIn the units place, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear? Every 10 numbers, once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 four, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more. So, 48+1=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in each place.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 eight, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds (1-400). In each of these, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but wait, our range is only up to 488. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480 is 480, which is tens digit 8, but 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all of these 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n   - Therefore, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. But 480 is within 401-488, right? So, 480 is included. So, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, that's 9 times. So, yes, 40 (from the full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so 98 eights in total.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 eight, so 48, plus in 481-488, units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48+1=49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 8 doesn't appear at all, so 0. So, total 8's are 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I got 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's and 8's more carefully.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 four, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens digit?\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 1-488, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. So, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89), so 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units digit?\n\nSame as 4's: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 eight, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens digit?\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. Now, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), each with tens digit 8. So, that's 9 eights.\n\nTherefore, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: As before, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because we only go up to 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. That's 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8, so 9 eights. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach to confirm. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a number with n digits, the count of a specific digit d in each position can be calculated as follows:\n\n- For the units place: total numbers divided by 10, plus any remainder if the digit is less than the current digit in the higher place.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to stick with my initial approach since it's more straightforward.\n\nWait, another way: for each digit place, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet me try that for 4's again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus the number of times 4 appears in the remaining partial decade.\n\n- So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete decades, each contributing 1 four, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is equal to the number of complete centuries (groups of 100) multiplied by 10, plus the number of times 4 appears in the tens place in the remaining partial century.\n\n- 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, 4 complete centuries, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- The number of times 4 appears in the hundreds place is equal to the number of numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete decades, each contributing 1 eight, so 48. In the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, 4 complete centuries, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought the answer might be 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me verify that again.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's, from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, yes, 49 in total for the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's: 98, difference: 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way. Maybe using the fact that in each digit place, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated by:\n\nFor a given digit d and position (units, tens, hundreds), the count is:\n\ncount = higher digits * 10^(position) + something based on the current digit.\n\nWait, perhaps using a formula would help confirm.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the i-th position (starting from the right, 0-based) in numbers from 1 to n is:\n\nLet the current position be i, and the digit at i in n be current_digit. The higher part is the number formed by digits to the left of current_digit, and the lower part is the number formed by digits to the right of current_digit plus 1.\n\nIf d < current_digit:\n    count = (higher + 1) * 10^i\nElse if d == current_digit:\n    count = higher * 10^i + (lower + 1)\nElse:\n    count = (higher + 1) * 10^i\n\nBut wait, I think I might have misremembered the exact formula. Let me try to recall.\n\nActually, the standard formula for counting the number of times a digit d appears in the i-th position from 0 to n is as follows:\n\nLet divisor = 10^(i+1)\nLet remainder = n % divisor\nLet quotient = n / divisor\nIf d < current_digit:\n    count = (quotient) * 10^i\nElse if d == current_digit:\n    count = quotient * 10^i + (remainder - (current_digit * 10^i) + 1)\nElse:\n    count = (quotient + 1) * 10^i\n\nBut I might be mixing up some parts. Let me try to apply this formula for digit 4 and 8 in each position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to stick with my initial counting method since it's more straightforward and I've already double-checked it.\n\nGiven that, I think the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, but let me check once more for the 8's in the tens place. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when counting in ranges, especially when the upper limit isn't a multiple of the digit cycle, you have to be careful. But in this case, I think my approach was correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nLet me try that for the units place:\n\n- For 4's in units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48, and then check if the units digit is >=4. Since 488 mod 10 =8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49.\n\n- For 8's in units place: floor(488 / 10)=48, and since 488 mod 10=8, which is equal to 8, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nThat's consistent with my earlier counts.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- For 4's in tens place: floor(488 / 100)=4, and then check the tens digit. The tens digit in 488 is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 10 for the current partial hundred. So, 4*10 +10=50.\n\n- For 8's in tens place: floor(488 / 100)=4, and the tens digit is 8, which is equal to 8, so we add (488 mod 100) +1=88+1=89? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Let me try again.\n\nWait, the formula for the tens place:\n\nFor digit d in the tens place:\n\ncount = higher * 10 + (if current_digit > d, then 10; else if current_digit == d, then (lower + 1); else 0)\n\nWait, maybe that's not the exact formula, but let me think.\n\nAlternatively, for the tens place, the number of times digit d appears is:\n\nhigher = floor(n / 100)\ncurrent = floor((n / 10) % 10)\nlower = n % 10\n\nif d < current:\n    count = (higher + 1) * 10\nelif d == current:\n    count = higher * 10 + (lower + 1)\nelse:\n    count = higher * 10\n\nWait, let's apply this for d=4 in the tens place, n=488.\n\nhigher = floor(488 / 100) =4\ncurrent = floor((488 / 10) %10)=floor(48.8)=48%10=8\nlower = 488 %10=8\n\nSince 4 < 8, count = (4 +1)*10=5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nFor d=8 in the tens place:\n\nhigher=4\ncurrent=8\nlower=8\n\nSince 8 == current, count=4*10 + (8 +1)=40 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place:\n\nFor d=4:\n\nhigher=floor(488/1000)=0\ncurrent=floor(488/100)=4\nlower=488%100=88\n\nSince d=4 == current=4, count=0*100 + (88 +1)=0 +89=89.\n\nFor d=8 in hundreds place:\n\nhigher=0\ncurrent=4\nlower=88\n\nSince 8 >4, count=0*100=0.\n\nSo, that confirms the counts we did earlier.\n\nThus, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's, so the answer is \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 occurrence of 4.\n   - Total units place 4's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n   - Total tens place 4's: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers from 400 to 488 contribute 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 occurrence of 8.\n   - Total units place 8's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences.\n   - Total tens place 8's: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit 8 does not appear in numbers up to 488.\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: \\( 49 + 49 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's: 188\n- Number of 8's: 98\n- Difference: \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\)\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488, and each page number is printed once. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nAlright, so let me start by thinking about how digits are counted in numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits, with the highest being 488.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears in a range of numbers, it's helpful to break it down by each digit position: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, I'll need to consider each position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\nI'll break this down into units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, there are 488 / 10 = 48 full sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times from the full sets, plus one more time in 484. Wait, but 484 is within 481-488, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place.\n   - So, in 400 numbers, that's 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, we have 488 pages, which is 88 pages beyond 400. So, from 400-488, the tens place cycles from 0-8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in 440-449, which is 10 times. But since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so that's another 10.\n   - Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 1-400, the tens place 4's are 40 times. Then from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. The 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 1-400, the tens place 4's occur in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. Hmm, but 440-449 is within 1-488, so maybe I don't need to adjust for that. Wait, no, 440-449 is part of 1-488, so yes, it's included. So, perhaps my initial count was correct: 50 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought from 1-400, it's 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10. So total 50. That seems correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89).\n   - So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. But that seems high. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check again. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then in the 481-488 range, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place, so that's 49 total. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds would be 40, but from 1-400, it's 40, and from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10, so 50 total. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcounting because in the hundreds place, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's correct. Units and tens places, I think the counts are correct too.\n\nNow, moving on to counting the number of 8's.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\nAgain, I'll break it down into units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, in every set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, so 48 times. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once more in 488.\n   - So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every set of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, that's 9 times.\n   - Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n   - So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so the total number of 4's is 188 and the total number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (1-480) with one 4 each, so 48. Then 481-488: 484 is the only one with a 4 in units, so 49 total.\n- Tens place: 1-400: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, earlier I thought 4 sets of 100, which would be 4*10=40, but actually, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens, 48, plus 488, so 49.\n- Tens place: 1-400: 4 sets of 100, each with 10 8's in tens place, so 4*10=40. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49 +49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about the tens place for 8's, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But 480 is included in 401-488, right? So that's correct, 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but 480 is the first number in that range where the tens digit is 8, and it goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 8, so 48 times, plus 488, which is the 49th.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct. So, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, how many numbers are there? 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a number with n digits, each digit position can be considered separately. For example, for the units place, the digit cycles every 10 numbers. For the tens place, every 100 numbers, etc.\n\nSo, for the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49.\n- Tens place: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, look at the last two digits: 88. The tens digit is 8, so we need to see how many times 4 appears in the tens place beyond the full hundreds. The tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so add 10. So total tens place 4's:40 +10=50.\n- Hundreds place: floor(488/1000)=0, but since we have 488, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49 +50 +89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit >=8, add 1. 488 mod10=8, so 48 +1=49.\n- Tens place: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, look at the last two digits:88. The tens digit is 8, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers. So, add 9. Total tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n- Hundreds place: floor(488/1000)=0, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one 4. For 488 pages, there are 48 full sets of 10, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers have 10 4's in the tens place. From 1-400, it's 40. From 401-488, 440-449 adds 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one 8. For 488 pages, 48 full sets plus one in 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers have 10 8's. From 1-400, it's 40. From 401-488, 480-488 adds 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I'm going to take it slow because I don't want to make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. Each page from 1 to 488 is numbered once, and I have to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nAlright, so I think the best way to approach this is to break down the problem into smaller parts. Maybe I can consider the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can calculate each place value's contribution to the total count.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like in 4, 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears once (like in 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an additional 8 numbers (from 481 to 488). \n\nSo, in the units place, for each of these 48 blocks, we have one 4 and one 8. Therefore, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, I also need to check those last 8 numbers: 481 to 488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear here? Yes, in 484, which is part of this last partial block. Similarly, 8 appears in 488. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, for the units place, total 4's would be 48 (from the full blocks) + 1 (from the partial block) = 49. Similarly, total 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. That means, in the units place, they are equal, so the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for example, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly, the digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is also 10 times.\n\nNow, how many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401 to 488.\n\nSo, in each of these 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. Therefore, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 4's and 4*10 = 40 8's.\n\nNow, let's look at the partial hundred from 401 to 488. The tens digits here go from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So, in the 400s, the tens digits are 0 (for 401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). \n\nWait, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each ten's digit is present for 10 numbers except maybe the last one, which is 8 and goes up to 488. So, let's check:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except the last one, which is 8, but it only goes up to 488, which is 8 numbers (481-488). Wait, that's only 8 numbers, not 10. So, actually, the tens digit 8 in this partial block appears only 8 times, not 10.\n\nWait, let me correct that. From 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all of these, but only 8 numbers, not 10. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 8 times in this partial block, not 10.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 4 in the tens place appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, in the partial block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place in the partial block (401-488):\n\n- 4's: 10\n- 8's: 8\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, across the entire book:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 8 (from partial) = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 48 times. The difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, each full hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40 for each. Then, in the partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, yes, 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+8=48 for 8's. So, the difference is indeed 2.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 from 1-99, 2 from 100-199, 3 from 200-299, and 4 from 300-399 and 400-488. So, from 300 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 300-399 (100 numbers) and 400-488 (89 numbers). So, total hundreds digit 4's would be 100 + 89 = 189.\n\nWait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times, right? Because from 400 to 488, each number has 4 in the hundreds place. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n\nWait, but also, from 300 to 399, the hundreds digit is 3, so that doesn't contribute to 4's in the hundreds place. So, the hundreds digit 4 only appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 times.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds digit 8? Well, in the book up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 would be beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is zero.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the contributions from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 4's, 49 8's \u2192 difference 0\n- Tens place: 50 4's, 48 8's \u2192 difference +2\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's \u2192 difference +89\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10: 48 (since 48*10=480), with 8 remaining pages (481-488).\n\nIn each block of 10, units digits 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 48 blocks give 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 +1=49, 8's:48+1=49. So, units place difference is 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach block of 100 contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4*10=40 each for 4's and 8's.\n\nThen, the partial block from 401-488. The tens digits in this range are:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's:40 +8=48. So, difference is 2. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. That's 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. So, 89 4's. 8's in hundreds place: 0, since we don't reach 800. So, difference is 89.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) +2 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any digits or miss any ranges. Let me check each place again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place:50\nHundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:48\nHundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188 -97=91\n\nYes, that matches. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. And 8's in the tens place are in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 8's. So, 40 (from full hundreds) +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +8=48 for 8's. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so no difference.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full blocks of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - **Total:** 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - Four full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - The partial block (401-488) adds 10 4's (441-450) and 8 8's (481-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\n3. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - From page 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, contributing 89 4's.\n   - There are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total:** 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n**Answer:** There are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should probably understand the problem better. Each page from 1 to 488 is printed once, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how digits are counted in numbers. Each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) can be considered separately when counting occurrences of a specific digit. So, I can break down the problem into counting the number of 4's and 8's in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. I should consider each digit position one by one.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place as we go through the numbers. But wait, from 1 to 488, does this hold true? Hmm, let me think. For every 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nBut since we're starting from 1, the first set is 1-10, which is 10 numbers, and then each subsequent set of 10 numbers follows. However, when we get to 488, it's not a multiple of 10, so the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are and then handle the remaining numbers separately. Let's see.\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete tens: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers.\n\nIn each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. So, for each complete group, both 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n\nSo, for 48 complete groups, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's.\n\nNow, for the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), let's check the units digits. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these 8 numbers, the units digit is 4 once (484) and 8 once (488). So, in the remaining numbers, both 4 and 8 each appear once more in the units place.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the units place: 48 (from complete groups) + 1 (from remaining) = 49.\n\nTotal 8's in the units place: 48 (from complete groups) + 1 (from remaining) = 49.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the count is equal here. That's interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, so each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut again, since 488 is not a multiple of 100, we'll have some complete hundreds and some remaining numbers.\n\nLet me calculate the number of complete hundreds in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49), so that's 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89), so 10 times as well.\n\nSo, for 4 complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and similarly for 8's, it's 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488) need to be checked for the tens digit.\n\nLet's break this down. The numbers 401-488 can be considered as 400-488, but since 400 is part of the hundreds, maybe it's better to think of 401-488 as starting from 401.\n\nWait, no, actually, 401-488 is 88 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, but starting from 401, so 401-488 is 88 numbers.\n\nSo, the tens digit in 401-488 goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). Let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFirst, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the 400s.\n\nFor the tens digit 4: it occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, in 401-488, 440-449 is entirely within this range, so that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit 8: it occurs in 480-489, but our range only goes up to 488, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 numbers.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from remaining) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from remaining) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's are more by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is more straightforward because it only changes every 100 numbers.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears for 100 numbers each. Wait, actually, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so not counted. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, 200-299 is 2, 300-399 is 3, and 400-488 is 4.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers (400-488). Wait, let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89, and the number of 8's is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's are way more than 8's, by 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, we subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- Each complete group of 10 contributes 1 four and 1 eight. There are 48 complete groups, so 48 each. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each complete hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights. 4 complete hundreds, so 40 each. The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) have tens digits from 0 to 8. For tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 9 = 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. No eights in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. Is 400-488 89 numbers? Let me calculate: 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 + 1 = 89. Yes, correct.\n\nAnother way to check: 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAlso, in the tens place, I considered 401-488 as 88 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 400 = 88, but starting from 401, so 401 to 488 is 88 numbers. So, when I broke down the tens digits, it was 401-488, which is 88 numbers, and within that, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, when I counted the tens digit 4 as 10 times (440-449) and tens digit 8 as 9 times (480-488), that seems accurate.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 (480 numbers) and 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n   - In each group, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n   - Remaining numbers: 484 and 488 contribute one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (400 numbers) and 88 remaining numbers (401-488).\n   - In each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n   - Remaining numbers: 440-449 (10 fours) and 480-488 (9 eights).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488 (89 numbers).\n   - The hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I think the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8, and finally subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I'll tackle the number of 4's. Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so I need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start with the units place.\n\nIn the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 10, the digit 4 appears once (at page 4). Similarly, from 11 to 20, it appears once at page 14, and so on. So for every block of 10 pages, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages. So in the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48. But wait, the last 8 pages (481 to 488) don't include a 4 in the units place, so I don't need to add anything extra there. So units place gives me 48 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place. Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 pages. For example, from 40 to 49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 pages. So in each 100-page block, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many full 100-page blocks are there in 488 pages? That's 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So that's 4 times 10, which is 40 fours from the tens place.\n\nBut wait, we also have the pages from 401 to 488. In this range, the tens digit is 0 for pages 401-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. So in this case, the tens digit is 4 only in the 440-449 range, which is 10 pages. So that's another 10 fours. So total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have double-counted. Let me check again. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So total is indeed 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds, which is 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48+50=98, and 98+89=187. So there are 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 pages. So from 1-488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. So 48 eights. The last 8 pages (481-488) include page 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's an extra one. So units place gives 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block has 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nFrom 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 pages (480-488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages. So how many full blocks of 10 are there? Let me count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 pages\n- 180-189: 10 pages\n- 280-289: 10 pages\n- 380-389: 10 pages\n- 480-488: 9 pages\n\nSo that's 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So the number of eights in the tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, no, actually, each block of 100 pages contributes one block of 10 eights in the tens place. So from 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So total eights in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds, which is 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49=98. That seems correct too.\n\nSo 187 - 98 = 89. So there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. Pages 400-488: that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4's, I had 50. Let me see: from 1-400, each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 blocks *10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours. So 40+10=50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48. Because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place. The last 8 pages (481-488) don't have a 4 in the units place, so no extra. So 48 fours in units place.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49. Because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last 8 pages include 488, which is an extra 8 in the units place, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place for 8's: from 1-400, 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights. So 40+9=49.\n\nSo yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds for 8's, totaling 98.\n\nSo 187 fours minus 98 eights equals 89 more fours.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be 89.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488, and each page number is printed once. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nAlright, so I guess I should approach this by looking at each digit place separately\u2014units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Because the number of times a digit appears in each place can be calculated separately, and then I can sum them up.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a complete set of numbers. But since we're only going up to 488, I might need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it in cycles. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once.\n\nBut since the book has 488 pages, I need to figure out how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then see if there are any extra numbers beyond that.\n\nLet me calculate how many complete tens are there in 488. Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers.\n\nIn each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so for 48 blocks, that's 48 times. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once per block, so that's 48 times as well.\n\nNow, looking at the extra 8 numbers beyond the 480th page. Those numbers are 481 to 488. Let's list their units digits:\n\n481: 1\n482: 2\n483: 3\n484: 4\n485: 5\n486: 6\n487: 7\n488: 8\n\nSo, in the units place for these extra numbers, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding that to the previous counts, the total for units place is:\n\n4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nHmm, interesting. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut again, since we're only going up to 488, we'll have to consider how many complete hundreds there are and any partial hundreds beyond that.\n\nLet me break down 488 into hundreds. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in each complete hundred.\n\nIn each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 40-49. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89.\n\nSo, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times for 4 and 4*10 = 40 times for 8.\n\nNow, let's look at the partial hundred from 401 to 488. The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, let me think. From 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-488). So, in this partial hundred, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's only in the 440-449 range, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? It's in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480 is included but 488 is the last page). Wait, actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we stop at 488, that's 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred:\n\n4's in tens place: 10 times (440-449)\n8's in tens place: 9 times (480-488)\n\nAdding that to the complete hundreds:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nSo, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 would have a hundreds digit of 4, right? So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, how about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, the total for the hundreds place is:\n\n4's: 89\n8's: 0\n\nSo, the difference in the hundreds place is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 0 more 4's\n- Tens place: 1 more 4\n- Hundreds place: 89 more 4's\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90\n\nWait, so that means there are 90 more 4's than 8's in all the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal numbers: 488\n\nNumber of complete tens: 48 (since 48*10 = 480), with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each complete ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in units place, so 48 each.\n\nIn the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units 4's: 48 +1=49, units 8's:48 +1=49. So, units difference is 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times per hundred, 8 appears 10 times per hundred.\n\n4 complete hundreds: 4*10=40 for 4, 4*10=40 for 8.\n\nThen, the partial hundred from 401-488: tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nIn this partial hundred, 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\n8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times.\n\nThus, total tens 4's: 40 +10=50, tens 8's:40 +9=49. So, difference is 1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, which is 89 numbers, the hundreds digit is 4. So, 4 appears 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, 0 times for 8.\n\nThus, hundreds difference: 89.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the total number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just check if I considered all the digits correctly.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nLet me try that approach to confirm.\n\nCalculating total number of 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, 48 complete tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus the extra in 484, so 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Plus the 10 in 440-449, so 50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n89 times from 400-488.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 4's in units, tens, and hundreds would sum up to 188.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when I calculated units, I had 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. So, 49+50=99, plus 89=188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, total number of 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place:49\nHundreds place:0\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier result. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When I calculated the units place, I had 49 for both 4's and 8's, but when I did the total 4's, I had 188, which included 49 from units, 50 from tens, and 89 from hundreds. For 8's, it's 49 from units and 49 from tens, so 98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. That seems correct.\n\nI think that's the right answer. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences each for 4 and 8.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - **Total:** 49 occurrences each for 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 4 complete hundreds contribute 40 occurrences each for 4 and 8.\n   - In the partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 for 4 and 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears 89 times from page 400 to 488.\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total:** 89 for 4 and 0 for 8.\n\nSumming up the occurrences:\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. Each page from 1 to 488 is numbered once, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit position separately: the units place and the tens place. Maybe even the hundreds place, since some page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. Let me start by breaking it down into units and tens.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for the digit 8. So, if I can figure out how many complete sets of ten there are in 488 pages, I can calculate how many times each digit appears in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: In every set of 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly for 8. So, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in the tens place by determining how many complete sets of 100 there are and then any remaining numbers.\n\nNow, let me calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal number of pages is 488. The number of complete sets of ten is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nWait, no, let me check that again. The total number of complete sets of ten is 48, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 +1 = 49 for 4, and 48 +1 = 49 for 8. So, units place is equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 (10 times), and 8 for 80-89 (10 times). So, how many complete sets of 100 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete sets of 100, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, that's 4*10=40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488) need to be considered. Wait, no, actually, the last partial set is from 401 to 488, which is 88 pages. But I think it's better to consider the tens digit in each 100-block. Wait, let me think again. From 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488.\n\nWait, no, 400 is the end of the fourth set. So, from 401-488 is 88 pages, but how does that affect the tens digit? Let me think: The tens digit in each 100-block is determined by the second digit. So, in 401-488, the tens digit can be 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. Wait, but the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, so that's 8 times for the digit 8 in the tens place. Similarly, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Wait, but 440 is within 401-488, right? Yes, because 401 is the start of the fifth set, and 440 is within that.\n\nWait, let me correct that. Each 100-block is 1-100, 101-200, etc., so the 401-500 block is the fifth 100-block, but our book ends at 488, so in the 401-488 range, the tens digit can be from 0 to 8.\n\nSo, in the 401-488 range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Wait, that's 9 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this range.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480 is the first number where the tens digit is 8, and the last is 488, so that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nTherefore, for the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 4 sets * 10 = 40 times, plus 10 times in the partial set, so total 50 times.\n\n- 8 appears 4 sets * 10 = 40 times, plus 9 times in the partial set, so total 49 times.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 401-488 is only 88 numbers, but let me check again.\n\nWait, no, each 100-block contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 sets of 100 (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 times each. Then, in 401-488, which is 88 numbers, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total for tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n\n- 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nWait, but that seems correct because 488 is less than 500, so the 8's in the tens place only go up to 488, which is 9 numbers, not 10.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3, or 4. Wait, actually, page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many times does that happen? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nThe digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if there were pages from 800 onwards, but since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 times\n\n- 8's: 0 times\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n\n- Tens place: 50\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the units place. Earlier, I thought that in the units place, 4 appears 49 times and 8 appears 49 times, but let me verify that.\n\nWait, total number of pages is 488. So, the number of complete sets of ten is 48, as 48*10=480, and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each complete set of ten, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, total units place 4's: 48 +1=49, and 8's: 48 +1=49. So that's correct.\n\nTens place: 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nWait, so 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check these calculations because 188 seems high for 4's. Let me go through each position again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 488 pages. Number of complete tens: 48 (since 48*10=480). Each contributes 1 4 and 1 8 in units place. So, 48 each.\n\n- Remaining 8 pages: 481-488. Units digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\nTotal units place: 48+1=49 for 4, 48+1=49 for 8.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4 complete hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in tens place: 4*10=40 each.\n\n- Remaining 88 pages (401-488). In the tens place:\n\n   - 4 appears in 440-449: 10 times.\n\n   - 8 appears in 480-488: 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place: 40+10=50 for 4's, 40+9=49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488: 89 times.\n\n- 8 appears: 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility I'm counting something twice or missing something?\n\nWait, for example, in the hundreds place, 400-488: 488-400+1=89 pages, so 89 times 4 in hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 times 4 in tens place, and 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times 8 in tens place. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets, each with one 4 and one 8, and the last 8 pages adding one each. So, 49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each set of ten consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of ten in 488 pages (48*10=480), contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, adding one 4 (at 484) and one 8 (at 488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 each.\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contains 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), contributing 40 each.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 for 4's, 49 for 8's.\n\n3. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should understand the problem clearly. The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488, each printed once. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, let's start by considering how digits are counted in numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number since 488 is a three-digit number. I think the best approach is to analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can systematically count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each position.\n\nLet me begin with the digit 4. I'll go through each place one by one.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives me 48 full blocks of 10 and 8 remaining numbers.\n   - In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times.\n   - Now, the remaining 8 numbers are from 481 to 488. The units digit here goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here.\n   - So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n   - Each full hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's.\n   - So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n   - So, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, adding them all up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Hmm, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 4's. In the tens place, 4 full hundreds give 40, and then in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 50 total. Units place: 48 times. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct.\n\n**Now, counting the number of 8's:**\n\nI'll use a similar approach, checking each digit place separately.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - As before, every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once.\n   - There are 488 numbers, so 48 full blocks of 10 and 8 remaining.\n   - Each full block contributes 1 8, so 48 times.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers are 481-488. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so 8 appears once in 488.\n   - So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds in 488, so 4 x 10 = 40 8's in the tens place from the full hundreds.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for the numbers 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, that's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n   - Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So that's 9 8's.\n   - So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - So, total 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total.\n\nWait, let me check again. Units place: 48 full blocks give 48, and the last 8 numbers include 488, which adds one more, so 49. Tens place: 4 full hundreds give 40, and in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9, making 49. Hundreds place: none. So, total 98 8's. That seems correct.\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\nNumber of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me confirm the counts again.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, but wait, let me check if I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. When I considered the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, up to 400, that's 4 times, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units place, 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in 481-488, the units digit 8 is in 488, so that's one more, making 49. Correct.\n\nSo, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 89 seems a bit high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe I should calculate how many times each digit appears in each position up to 488.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor a number with n digits, the count of a specific digit in each position can be calculated based on higher digits and lower digits.\n\nBut since 488 is a three-digit number, let's handle each digit place separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. Units place:\n   - As before, 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48.\n   - The remainder is 8, so from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so no additional 4's.\n   - Total: 48.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100. The number of complete hundreds is 4 (1-400).\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40.\n   - Now, the remaining numbers are 401-488.\n   - The tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - So, 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. Units place:\n   - 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48.\n   - Remainder is 8, so in 481-488, units digit 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100. The number of complete hundreds is 4 (1-400).\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40.\n   - Remaining numbers: 401-488.\n   - The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 more.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - No 8's, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, so that's consistent. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nLet's say I have a 20-page book. How many 4's and 8's?\n\nPage numbers 1-20.\n\nCounting 4's:\n- Units place: 4,14 \u2192 2 times.\n- Tens place: 40-49, but we only go up to 20, so no 4's in tens place.\n- Hundreds place: none.\nTotal 4's: 2.\n\nCounting 8's:\n- Units place: 8,18 \u2192 2 times.\n- Tens place: 80-89, but we only go up to 20, so no 8's in tens place.\n- Hundreds place: none.\nTotal 8's: 2.\n\nDifference: 2 - 2 = 0. Hmm, that's correct because in 1-20, 4's and 8's appear equally in units place, and no higher digits.\n\nAnother example: 50-page book.\n\nCounting 4's:\n- Units: 4,14,24,34,44 \u2192 5 times.\n- Tens: 40-49 \u2192 10 times.\n- Hundreds: none.\nTotal 4's: 5 + 10 = 15.\n\nCounting 8's:\n- Units: 8,18,28,38,48 \u2192 5 times.\n- Tens: 40-49: no 8's; 50: no. So, tens place: 0.\n- Hundreds: none.\nTotal 8's: 5.\n\nDifference: 15 - 5 = 10.\n\nWait, but let's count manually. From 1-50:\n\n4's: 4,14,24,34,44 (units:5), and 40-49 (tens:10). So, total 15.\n\n8's: 8,18,28,38,48 (units:5), and in tens place, none because 80-89 is beyond 50. So, total 5. Difference: 10. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for smaller numbers, so I think it's correct for 488.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.  \n   - Total: 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, so 48 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every 100 numbers contribute ten 4's.  \n   - Total: 4 full hundreds (4 x 10 = 40) plus 10 from 440-449.  \n   - Total: 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - From 400-488, each number contributes one 4.  \n   - Total: 89 fours.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.  \n   - Total: 48 full cycles, plus one in 488.  \n   - Total: 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every 100 numbers contribute ten 8's.  \n   - Total: 4 full hundreds (4 x 10 = 40) plus 9 from 480-488.  \n   - Total: 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No 8's as the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total: 0 eights.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{89}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488, and each page number is printed once. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, so the plan is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference. Let me start by considering how digits are distributed in page numbers. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, or 4-digit numbers, but since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a 3-digit number. So, I need to consider 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit page numbers.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the counting based on the number of digits in the page numbers. Let's start with 1-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. Then, 2-digit numbers from 10 to 99, and finally, 3-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nStarting with 1-digit page numbers (1-9):\n- The digit 4 appears once, in the number 4.\n- The digit 8 appears once, in the number 8.\nSo, in 1-digit numbers, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So far, the count for 4 is 1 and for 8 is 1.\n\nMoving on to 2-digit page numbers (10-99):\nHere, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place:\n- The tens digit is 4, so the numbers are 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the number of times 4 appears in the units place:\n- For each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 groups (10-19 up to 90-99), so 4 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in 2-digit numbers is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nSimilarly, let's count the number of times 8 appears in the tens place:\n- The tens digit is 8, so the numbers are 80 to 89. That's 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the number of times 8 appears in the units place:\n- Again, for each ten's group, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group, 8 appears once in the units place. There are 9 groups, so 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's in 2-digit numbers is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check. For 2-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place and 9 times in the units place? Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, each digit from 1 to 9 appears 10 times (e.g., 10-19 for 1 in the tens place), and in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 9 times (since there are 9 groups of ten). So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times, and in the units place, it's 9 times. Same for 8. So, yes, 19 each. So, 4's and 8's both appear 19 times in 2-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to 3-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because the range doesn't go up to 999, so I have to be careful not to overcount beyond 488.\n\nLet me break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book ends at 488.\n\nLet's handle each hundreds digit separately.\n\nHundreds digit = 1 (numbers 100-199):\n- Now, within this range, I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens and units places.\n\nBut wait, I also need to consider the hundreds digit itself. For 4's and 8's in the hundreds place, 4 appears once in 400-488, but 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place for any 3-digit number in this book.\n\nSo, let's first count 4's in the hundreds place. In 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place for hundreds digit = 1 (100-199):\n- For each tens group (e.g., 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's once per hundred, so 10 times (from 140-149). Similarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's once per hundred, so 10 times (from 180-189).\n\nNow, the units place for hundreds digit = 1:\n- For each tens group, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once in the units place. There are 10 tens groups (00-09, 10-19, ..., 90-99), so 4 appears 10 times in the units place, and 8 appears 10 times in the units place.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit = 1, the count of 4's is:\n- Tens place: 10\n- Units place: 10\n- Hundreds place: 0 (since 1 is not 4 or 8)\nTotal: 20.\n\nSimilarly, count of 8's is:\n- Tens place: 10\n- Units place: 10\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 20.\n\nWait, but wait, 100-199 is 100 numbers, so each digit in tens and units appears 10 times each. So, that seems correct.\n\nNext, hundreds digit = 2 (200-299):\n- Similar to hundreds digit = 1, the hundreds digit is 2, which isn't 4 or 8, so no contribution from the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in 240-249, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 280-289, which is 10 times.\n\nIn the units place, for each tens group, 4 and 8 each appear once per group. There are 10 groups, so 10 times each.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit = 2:\n- 4's: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20\n- 8's: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20\n\nHundreds digit = 3 (300-399):\n- Hundreds digit is 3, which isn't 4 or 8, so no contribution.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in 340-349 (10 times), and 8 appears in 380-389 (10 times).\n\nIn the units place, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times, so 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit = 3:\n- 4's: 10 + 10 = 20\n- 8's: 10 + 10 = 20\n\nNow, hundreds digit = 4 (400-488):\nThis is where things get a bit tricky because the range doesn't go up to 499 but stops at 488. So, I need to adjust the counts accordingly.\n\nFirst, let's handle the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times (from 400 to 488 inclusive), as I thought earlier.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place for hundreds digit = 4:\n- The tens digit can be from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488).\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the tens digit can be 0 to 8, but when the tens digit is 8, the units digit only goes up to 8, not 9. So, I need to adjust for that.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nTens digit = 0: 400-409 (10 numbers)\nTens digit = 1: 410-419 (10 numbers)\n...\nTens digit = 7: 470-479 (10 numbers)\nTens digit = 8: 480-488 (9 numbers)\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nLooking for when the tens digit is 4. So, in the range 440-449, the tens digit is 4. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? That's when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place for hundreds digit = 4:\nWe need to check each tens group and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\nLet me go through each tens group:\n\n- Tens digit = 0 (400-409): Units digits 0-9. So, 4 appears once (404), and 8 appears once (408).\n- Tens digit = 1 (410-419): Similarly, 4 appears once (414), and 8 appears once (418).\n- Tens digit = 2 (420-429): 424 and 428.\n- Tens digit = 3 (430-439): 434 and 438.\n- Tens digit = 4 (440-449): 444 and 448.\n- Tens digit = 5 (450-459): 454 and 458.\n- Tens digit = 6 (460-469): 464 and 468.\n- Tens digit = 7 (470-479): 474 and 478.\n- Tens digit = 8 (480-488): Units digits 0-8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n\nWait, but 480-488 has 9 numbers, so units digits 0-8. So, 484 is there, and 488 is the last page. So, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once in the units place for this group.\n\nSo, for each tens group from 0 to 7, there are 10 numbers, so 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place per group. That's 8 groups, so 8 times each.\n\nThen, for the tens digit = 8 group, we have 9 numbers, but 4 and 8 each still appear once in the units place (484 and 488). So, that adds one more each.\n\nSo, total units place counts for 4 and 8 when hundreds digit is 4:\n\n- 4's: 8 groups * 1 = 8, plus 1 more in the last group, so 9.\n- 8's: Similarly, 8 groups * 1 = 8, plus 1 more in the last group, so 9.\n\nWait, but wait, let me recount. For tens digits 0-7, that's 8 groups, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8. Then, tens digit 8 contributes 1 to each as well. So, that's 8 + 1 = 9 for both 4 and 8.\n\nSo, in the units place, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check for tens digit 8: 480-488. Units digits are 0-8, so 484 is 4 in the units, and 488 is 8 in the units. So, yes, each appears once.\n\nSo, total for units place in hundreds digit 4: 9 times each.\n\nSo, putting it all together for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (as 4 is in the hundreds place)\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times\n- Units place: 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds digit 4:\n89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 108\n\nTotal 8's in hundreds digit 4:\n0 (hundreds) + 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again.\n\nWait, hundreds digit 4 contributes 89 times for 4 in the hundreds place, correct.\n\nFor tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), correct.\n\nFor units place, 4 appears 9 times, correct.\n\nSo, 89 + 10 + 9 = 108 4's in hundreds digit 4.\n\nFor 8's in hundreds digit 4:\n\nTens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 9 times, as above.\n\nSo, total 8's: 9 + 9 = 18.\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts for each digit place across all page numbers.\n\n1-digit numbers (1-9):\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\n2-digit numbers (10-99):\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\n3-digit numbers (100-488):\n- Hundreds digit = 1: 4's = 20, 8's = 20\n- Hundreds digit = 2: 4's = 20, 8's = 20\n- Hundreds digit = 3: 4's = 20, 8's = 20\n- Hundreds digit = 4: 4's = 108, 8's = 18\n\nWait, so let me add these up:\n\nFor 4's:\n1-digit: 1\n2-digit: 19\n3-digit:\n- Hundreds 1: 20\n- Hundreds 2: 20\n- Hundreds 3: 20\n- Hundreds 4: 108\nTotal 4's = 1 + 19 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 108\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, 3-digit numbers are from 100-488, so hundreds digits 1,2,3,4. Each of those contributes as above.\n\nWait, but 100-199: 20 4's and 20 8's\n200-299: 20 4's and 20 8's\n300-399: 20 4's and 20 8's\n400-488: 108 4's and 18 8's\n\nSo, total 4's in 3-digit numbers: 20 + 20 + 20 + 108 = 168\nTotal 8's in 3-digit numbers: 20 + 20 + 20 + 18 = 78\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n20 (100-199) + 20 (200-299) + 20 (300-399) + 108 (400-488) = 168\nSimilarly, 20 + 20 + 20 + 18 = 78\n\nSo, total 4's in the entire book:\n1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 168 (3-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188\n\nTotal 8's in the entire book:\n1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 78 (3-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:\n\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\nWait, so 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting with 1-digit numbers: 4 appears once, 8 appears once. That's correct.\n\n2-digit numbers: 19 each. That seems correct because in tens place, 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and in units place, 9 times (14,24,...,94). Similarly for 8.\n\n3-digit numbers:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 20 4's and 20 8's. So, 3 * 20 = 60 for 4's and 3 * 20 = 60 for 8's.\n\nThen, hundreds digit 4 contributes 108 4's and 18 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 60 + 108 = 168\nTotal 8's: 60 + 18 = 78\n\nAdding 1-digit and 2-digit:\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the 3-digit numbers again, especially the hundreds digit 4, because that's where the bulk of the 4's come from.\n\nIn hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (400 to 488 inclusive)\n- Tens place: 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times\n- Units place: For each tens group from 0 to 8, 4 appears once in the units place, except for the last group (480-488), which only goes up to 8, but 484 is still present. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nFrom 400-488, the units digit cycles through 0-9 for each tens group except the last one, which is 0-8.\n\nSo, for tens digits 0-7, each has 10 numbers, so 4 appears once in the units place for each, totaling 8 times. Then, for tens digit 8, 480-488 includes 484, so that's one more. So, total 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, each tens group from 0-7 has one 8 in the units place, so 8 times, and in the last group (480-488), 488 is present, so that's one more, totaling 9 times.\n\nSo, units place: 9 times for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers).\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds digit 4:\n\n89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 108\n\nTotal 8's in hundreds digit 4:\n\n0 (hundreds) + 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's:\n\n1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 20 (100-199) + 20 (200-299) + 20 (300-399) + 108 (400-488) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 20 = 40; 40 + 20 = 60; 60 + 20 = 80; 80 + 108 = 188\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\n1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 20 (100-199) + 20 (200-299) + 20 (300-399) + 18 (400-488) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 20 = 40; 40 + 20 = 60; 60 + 20 = 80; 80 + 18 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.).\n   - To find how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full blocks of 10 and a remainder of 8. So, 48 times 1 is 48, but wait, actually, since each block contributes one 4, it's 48 times, but I need to check if the last partial block (481-488) includes another 4 in the units place. 484 is within that range, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. The number of complete tens is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). Each complete ten contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So 484 has a 4 in the units place. So that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - So, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488. In this range, the tens digit is 4 for 401-410, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10.\n   - Wait, no, 401-410 is 10 numbers, but the tens digit is 0 in 401, right? Wait, no, 401-410: the tens digit is 0 in 401, 402,...,409, and 1 in 410. Wait, that's not right. Actually, 401-410: the tens digit is 0 for 401-410? No, wait, 401 is 4 0 1, so the tens digit is 0. 410 is 4 1 0, so the tens digit is 1. So in 401-410, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, and 1 for 410. So the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, but wait, 440 is beyond 488? No, 440 is within 488. Wait, no, 401-488 includes 440-449, which is another 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.\n   - So, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10.\n   - So total tens place 4's: 40 (from the first 400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The tens digit cycles every 100. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So from 1 to 400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n   - Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 to 488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 4's? Every 10 numbers, so 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 4 at 484, so one more, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place: For each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488. So that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 4's. Wait, but earlier I thought only 4 hundreds, but actually, from 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So that's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place?\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 8 at 488, so that's one more. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488.\n   - So, each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except possibly the last one.\n   - From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n   - Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 8's in the tens place.\n   - So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for the 8's in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 8's. So 4*10=40 from the first four hundreds, plus 9, total 49. Correct.\n\nAnd for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different. Let me check again.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: For each digit position, count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is given by:\n\nfloor(N / 10) * 1 + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, but that's for digits 0-9. Wait, no, actually, for each digit d, the count is:\n\ncount_units = (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0) if d != 0 else (N // 10)\n\nWait, but for d=4:\n\nN=488.\n\ncount_units_4 = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >= 4 else 0) = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\ncount_units_8 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nThe formula is similar, but we consider higher digits.\n\ncount_tens_d = (N // 100) * 10 + extra\n\nWhere extra depends on the remainder.\n\nFor d=4:\n\nN=488.\n\ncount_tens_4 = (488 // 100) * 10 + (min(488 % 100 - 4*10 + 1, 10) if (488 // 100) * 100 + 4*10 <= 488 else 0)\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think as:\n\nFor each hundred block, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (since 488 // 100 = 4).\n\nSo 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4, each contributing 10 8's, so 40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nFor d=4, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nFor d=8, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in 1-488, so 0.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So yes, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I count the tens place for 4's, I included 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's correct. Similarly, for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is correct.\n\nYes, I think this is correct. So the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I'll try to think through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488, and each page number is printed once. I need to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit '8'. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nAlright, so the plan is:\n\n1. Count the number of 4's in all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n2. Count the number of 8's in all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n3. Subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by tackling the first part: counting the number of 4's.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the problem by the number of digits in the page numbers. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, or 4-digit numbers in this case, since 488 is a 3-digit number. Wait, actually, 488 is a 3-digit number, so the page numbers go from 1 (1-digit) up to 488 (3-digit). So, I need to consider 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit page numbers separately.\n\nLet me handle each digit position separately for each page number length.\n\nStarting with 1-digit page numbers: these are from 1 to 9.\n\nIn this range, the digit '4' appears once, which is on page 4.\n\nThe digit '8' also appears once, on page 8.\n\nSo, for 1-digit page numbers, the count of 4's is 1 and 8's is 1.\n\nMoving on to 2-digit page numbers: these are from 10 to 99.\n\nI need to count how many times '4' appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. The same goes for '8'.\n\nFirst, for the tens place in 2-digit numbers:\n\n- The tens digit can be from 1 to 9. For each tens digit, the units digit can be from 0 to 9, making 10 numbers per tens digit.\n\nSo, for the digit '4' in the tens place, the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so '4' appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for '8' in the tens place, the numbers would be 80-89, another 10 times.\n\nNow, for the units place in 2-digit numbers:\n\n- For each tens digit (1-9), the units digit can be 0-9. So, for each tens digit, '4' appears once in the units place. There are 9 tens digits, so 9 times in total for '4'.\n\nSimilarly, '8' appears once in the units place for each tens digit, so 9 times in total.\n\nWait, but let me check that. For example, for tens digit 1, the units digits go from 0-9, so 14 is one occurrence of '4' in the units place. Similarly, 24, 34, etc., up to 94. That's 9 times, right? Because 44 would have been counted in both tens and units places.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, we already counted 40-49, so in the units place, for '4', we have 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but 44 has two '4's, but we're only counting the units place here, so it's still 9 times. Hmm, but wait, 44 is included in both the tens and units counts, but each count is separate. So, the total number of '4's in 2-digit numbers is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's in 2-digit numbers, it's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me take a specific example. For '4's in the units place, from 10-99, how many times does '4' appear? It's every 10 numbers: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 '4's in the units place. Similarly, in the tens place, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's. So total '4's in 2-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nSame for '8's: 80-89 is 10 '8's in the tens place, and in the units place, 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 '8's, so total 10 + 9 = 19 '8's in 2-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but hold on, 88 is in both the tens and units places, but when we count '8's in the tens place, 80-89 includes 88, and in the units place, 18,28,...,98 also includes 88. So, each '8' in 88 is counted separately: one in the tens place and one in the units place. So, the total count is correct as 19 for both '4's and '8's in 2-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to 3-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488.\n\nThis is a bit more complex because the range doesn't go up to 999, it stops at 488. So, I need to be careful with the hundreds digit and the tens and units digits beyond that.\n\nLet me break it down by digit positions: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nBut since the book ends at 488, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens and units digits are limited up to 88.\n\nWait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only for pages 400-488, so I need to handle that separately.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n3-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nSo, hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nFor each hundreds digit, I can calculate the number of '4's and '8's in the tens and units places.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to split it into two parts: hundreds digits 1-3, and hundreds digit 4.\n\nBecause for hundreds digits 1-3, the tens and units can go up to 99, but for hundreds digit 4, the tens and units go only up to 88.\n\nSo, let's handle hundreds digits 1-3 first.\n\nHundreds digits 1, 2, 3:\n\nFor each of these, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, none of which are '4' or '8', so they don't contribute to the count of '4's or '8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the tens and units digits can range from 00 to 99 for each hundreds digit, except for the last one, which is 400-488.\n\nSo, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3:\n\nEach of these will have 100 numbers (e.g., 100-199, 200-299, 300-399).\n\nIn each of these ranges, I can calculate the number of '4's and '8's in the tens and units places.\n\nLet me first calculate the number of '4's in the tens and units places for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3.\n\nFor each hundreds digit (1,2,3):\n\n- Tens place: For each tens digit (0-9), the units digit can be 0-9, so 10 numbers per tens digit.\n\nSo, for '4' in the tens place, it's 40-49 in each hundred, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's per hundreds digit.\n\nSimilarly, for '8' in the tens place, it's 80-89, another 10 '8's per hundreds digit.\n\nFor the units place, for each hundreds digit, each tens digit (0-9) will have one '4' in the units place (e.g., x4, where x is the tens digit). So, for each hundreds digit, there are 10 '4's in the units place (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194).\n\nSimilarly, for '8's in the units place, it's 10 '8's per hundreds digit (e.g., 108, 118, ..., 198).\n\nSo, for each hundreds digit (1,2,3):\n\n- '4's in tens place: 10\n- '4's in units place: 10\n- Total '4's: 20\n\nSimilarly for '8's:\n\n- '8's in tens place: 10\n- '8's in units place: 10\n- Total '8's: 20\n\nSince there are 3 hundreds digits (1,2,3), the total '4's in this range would be 3 * 20 = 60.\n\nSimilarly, the total '8's would be 3 * 20 = 60.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds digit 4, which covers pages 400-488.\n\nHere, the hundreds digit is 4, so each page number is of the form 4XY, where X is the tens digit and Y is the units digit.\n\nFirst, let's count the '4's in the hundreds place. Since every page from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of '4', that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit '4' appears 89 times.\n\nNow, for the tens and units digits in 400-488:\n\nWe need to count how many times '4' and '8' appear in the tens and units places.\n\nFirst, let's handle the tens place.\n\nThe tens digit can be from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digits go from 0 (for 400-409) up to 8 (for 480-488).\n\nSimilarly, the units digit can be from 0 to 9, except when the tens digit is 8, where the units digit can only go up to 8.\n\nWait, but actually, for each tens digit, the units digit can go from 0 to 9, except when the tens digit is 8, in which case the units digit goes up to 8 because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\nFor the tens digit in 400-488:\n\n- Tens digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nFor each tens digit except 8, the units digit goes from 0-9, giving 10 numbers per tens digit.\n\nFor tens digit 8, the units digit goes from 0-8, giving 9 numbers.\n\nNow, let's count the '4's and '8's in the tens and units places.\n\nStarting with the tens place:\n\nFor '4's in the tens place: when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 '4's in the tens place.\n\nFor '8's in the tens place: when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 '8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place:\n\nWe need to count how many times '4' and '8' appear in the units place across all numbers from 400-488.\n\nLet me approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, we can determine how many times '4' and '8' appear in the units place.\n\nFor tens digits 0-7:\n\nEach of these tens digits has 10 numbers (units 0-9), so in each, '4' appears once in the units place, and '8' appears once.\n\nSo, for tens digits 0-7 (8 tens digits):\n\n- '4's in units place: 8 * 1 = 8\n- '8's in units place: 8 * 1 = 8\n\nNow, for tens digit 8:\n\nThe units digits go from 0-8, so 9 numbers. In these, '4' appears once (at units digit 4) and '8' appears once (at units digit 8).\n\nSo, for tens digit 8:\n\n- '4's in units place: 1\n- '8's in units place: 1\n\nTherefore, total '4's in units place across 400-488:\n\n8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9\n\nSimilarly, total '8's in units place:\n\n8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9\n\nNow, let's sum up all the '4's in the 3-digit numbers:\n\nFrom hundreds digits 1-3: 60\nFrom hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 '4's\n- Tens place: 10 '4's\n- Units place: 9 '4's\n\nSo, total '4's in hundreds digit 4: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, the hundreds digit '4' is 89 times, but when we're counting '4's in the hundreds place, that's separate from the tens and units places. So, the total '4's in 400-488 would be:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 10\n- Units place: 9\nTotal: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108\n\nSimilarly, for '8's in 400-488:\n\n- Tens place: 9 '8's (from 480-488)\n- Units place: 9 '8's (as calculated above)\nSo, total '8's in 400-488: 9 + 9 = 18\n\nWait, but wait, the hundreds digit is 4, so there are no '8's in the hundreds place in 400-488.\n\nSo, total '8's in 400-488: 18\n\nNow, let me recap:\n\nTotal '4's in all page numbers:\n\n1-digit: 1\n2-digit: 19\n3-digit (100-399): 60\n3-digit (400-488): 108\nTotal '4's: 1 + 19 + 60 + 108 = let's calculate:\n\n1 + 19 = 20\n20 + 60 = 80\n80 + 108 = 188\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 100-399 is 300 numbers, and I calculated 60 '4's there. Then 400-488 is 89 numbers, and I calculated 108 '4's. Plus 1-digit and 2-digit.\n\nWait, but let me check the 3-digit numbers again. Wait, when I calculated 3-digit numbers from 100-399, I considered each hundreds digit (1,2,3) and found 20 '4's per hundreds digit, so 3 * 20 = 60. That seems correct.\n\nThen, for 400-488, I have 89 '4's in the hundreds place, plus 10 in the tens place (440-449) and 9 in the units place, totaling 108. So, 60 + 108 = 168 '4's in 3-digit numbers, plus 1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) = 20. So total '4's: 168 + 20 = 188.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct because 488 pages, so 1-488, which includes 488 numbers, but I'm counting '4's in each digit place.\n\nNow, total '8's:\n\n1-digit: 1\n2-digit: 19\n3-digit (100-399): 60\n3-digit (400-488): 18\nTotal '8's: 1 + 19 + 60 + 18 = let's calculate:\n\n1 + 19 = 20\n20 + 60 = 80\n80 + 18 = 98\n\nWait, that seems plausible.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the 3-digit numbers for '8's.\n\nIn 100-399, for each hundreds digit (1,2,3), we have 20 '8's each, so 3 * 20 = 60. That seems correct.\n\nIn 400-488, '8's only appear in the tens place (480-488) and units place. So, in the tens place, 9 '8's, and in the units place, 9 '8's, totaling 18. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total '8's: 1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 60 (3-digit 100-399) + 18 (400-488) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in 400-488, '8's in the hundreds place would be zero, which is correct.\n\nSo, total '4's: 188\nTotal '8's: 98\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of these calculations.\n\nWait, let me go through each step again.\n\n1-digit numbers:\n\n- '4's: 1 (page 4)\n- '8's: 1 (page 8)\n\n2-digit numbers:\n\n- '4's: 10 (tens place: 40-49) + 9 (units place: 14,24,...,94) = 19\n- '8's: 10 (tens place: 80-89) + 9 (units place: 18,28,...,98) = 19\n\n3-digit numbers 100-399:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3\n- For each hundreds digit:\n  - Tens place: 10 '4's (e.g., 140-149)\n  - Units place: 10 '4's (e.g., 104,114,...,194)\n  - Total '4's per hundreds digit: 20\n  - Similarly, '8's: 20 per hundreds digit\n- So, 3 hundreds digits: 3 * 20 = 60 '4's and 60 '8's\n\n3-digit numbers 400-488:\n\n- Hundreds digit: 4, appearing 89 times\n- Tens place:\n  - '4's: 10 (440-449)\n  - '8's: 9 (480-488)\n- Units place:\n  - '4's: For each tens digit 0-7, 1 '4' each, so 8 '4's, and for tens digit 8, 1 '4' (484), total 9\n  - '8's: For each tens digit 0-7, 1 '8' each, so 8 '8's, and for tens digit 8, 1 '8' (488), total 9\n- So, '4's in 400-488:\n  - Hundreds: 89\n  - Tens: 10\n  - Units: 9\n  - Total: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108\n- '8's in 400-488:\n  - Tens: 9\n  - Units: 9\n  - Total: 18\n\nSo, total '4's:\n\n1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 60 (100-399) + 108 (400-488) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 60 = 80; 80 + 108 = 188\n\nTotal '8's:\n\n1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 60 (100-399) + 18 (400-488) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 60 = 80; 80 + 18 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. Maybe I can count how many times each digit (4 and 8) appears in each place and then add them up. That makes sense because each digit's occurrence can be calculated independently in their respective places.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once, as does the digit 8. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each of these 48 sets, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, that's 48 times each. Now, for the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, the count for units place is equal for both digits.\n\nMoving on to the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49), and the same for 8 (like 80-89). \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10 = 40 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4*10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the 400s, the tens digits would be 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). \n\nWait, but in the tens place, for each ten pages, the tens digit is fixed. So, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8, but each digit appears 10 times except for the last one, which is only 9 times because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) but since we're starting at 401, the first ten pages (401-410) have a tens digit of 0, but 410 is included. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think that in the range 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 400-409: tens digit is 0 (but 400 is included in the previous hundreds, so maybe 401-409 has tens digit 0, but only 9 pages? Wait, no, 401-409 is 9 pages, but 400 is a separate page. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider that in the 400-499 range, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, each appearing 10 times. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit goes up to 8, and each digit from 0-8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, actually, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 appears only 9 times (480-488 is 9 pages). Hmm, but 480 is included in the 400-499 range, so from 400-488, the tens digits from 0-8 each appear how many times?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate how many times each tens digit appears in 401-488.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 9 times because 488 is the end. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the 400-488 range.\n\nSo, for the tens place in 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 10 times (400-409, but starting at 401, so 401-409 is 9 pages. Wait, that's a problem. Because 400 is page 400, which is part of the 400-499 range, but we're starting at 401. So, from 401-409, that's 9 pages, so tens digit 0 appears 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, from 410-419: tens digit 1, 10 pages.\n\nFrom 420-429: tens digit 2, 10 pages.\n\n...\n\nFrom 480-488: tens digit 8, 9 pages.\n\nSo, in the 400-488 range, the tens digits:\n\n- 0: 9 times\n- 1: 10 times\n- 2: 10 times\n- 3: 10 times\n- 4: 10 times\n- 5: 10 times\n- 6: 10 times\n- 7: 10 times\n- 8: 9 times\n\nSo, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place overall:\n\n- Digit 4: 4 hundreds * 10 times each = 40 times, plus in 400-488, 10 times. So total 50 times.\n- Digit 8: 4 hundreds * 10 times each = 40 times, plus in 400-488, 9 times. So total 49 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, but in the 100-199, 200-299, etc., the tens digit 8 appears 10 times each. So, for the 4 hundreds before 400, each contributes 10 times for 8 in the tens place. Then in 400-488, it's 9 times. So, total for 8 in tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the tens place, each of the 4 hundreds contributes 10 times, and in 400-488, it's another 10 times, so 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times because 440-449 is 10 pages. So yes, 10 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 50 times\n- 8 appears 49 times\n\nSo, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case because the book has 488 pages.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has the hundreds digit fixed.\n\nSo, for each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, appears 100 times.\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, appears 100 times.\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, appears 100 times.\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appears 89 times (since 400-488 is 89 pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nWait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the digit 8 in the hundreds place: Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nSo, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 - 49 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 49 = 1\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times because from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times, so difference is 1.\n\nIn the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times, so difference is 0.\n\nSo total difference is 89 + 1 + 0 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8.\n\nThere are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nThen, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. For each tens digit, how many times does it appear?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, in the 400-488 range:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 10 times (400-409, but since we start at 401, it's 401-409, which is 9 pages. Wait, that's a problem. Because 400 is page 400, which is included in the 400-488 range. So, 400-409 is 10 pages, but since we're starting at 401, it's 401-409, which is 9 pages, so tens digit 0 appears 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 1: 410-419, 10 pages.\n\nTens digit 2: 420-429, 10 pages.\n\n...\n\nTens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSo, in the 400-488 range, the tens digits:\n\n- 0: 9 times\n- 1: 10 times\n- 2: 10 times\n- 3: 10 times\n- 4: 10 times\n- 5: 10 times\n- 6: 10 times\n- 7: 10 times\n- 8: 9 times\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: 4*10 (from the first 4 hundreds) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 times\n- Digit 8: 4*10 (from the first 4 hundreds) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49 times\n\nSo, the difference in the tens place is indeed 1.\n\nIn the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4: 89 times\n- Digit 8: 0 times\n\nSo, difference is 89.\n\nUnits place: Both 4 and 8 appear 49 times, so difference is 0.\n\nTotal difference: 89 + 1 = 90.\n\nWait, but the book is 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4, but does 488 have a hundreds digit of 4? Yes, because 488 is between 400 and 499.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit for 488 is 4, so that's included in the 89 times.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, no, that's not necessary. The question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the counts again because I might have double-counted or missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (each contributing 1) plus 1 in the extra 8 pages (484), so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 in the tens place, so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus in the 400-488 range, 10 times (440-449), so 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (each contributing 1) plus 1 in the extra 8 pages (488), so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times for 8 in the tens place, so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus in the 400-488 range, 9 times (480-488), so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 8 never appears, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
