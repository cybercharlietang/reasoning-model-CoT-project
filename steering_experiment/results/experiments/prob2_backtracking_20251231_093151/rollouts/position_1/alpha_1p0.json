    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured. Each page has a number from 1 to 488, and each digit in these numbers can be a 4 or an 8. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I should consider how digits are arranged in page numbers. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488, which means the highest is a 3-digit number, 488. So, I need to check each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by calculating how many times the digit 4 appears in each place. I'll do the same for the digit 8 and then compare.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in each block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place goes from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. But wait, when the page numbers start from 1, the first block is 1-10, where the units digits are 1-0. So, in the first block, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in this case, 4 appears once (at page 4), and 8 appears once (at page 8). Similarly, in the next block, 11-20, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 again. So, again, 4 and 8 each appear once per block of 10.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8 pages (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). Wait, actually, 48*10 is 480, so pages 481-488 are the remaining 8 pages.\n\nBut wait, when counting units digits, each block of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 full blocks, that's 48 times each. Then, in the last partial block, pages 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, does the digit 4 appear? Yes, at page 484, so that's one more 4. Does the digit 8 appear? Yes, at page 488, so that's one more 8. So, for units place, total 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49, and total 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal. Hmm, interesting.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For the units digit, each full block of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8. So, 48 blocks would give 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, yes, units place: 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place over 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in each hundred, it's 10 times (e.g., 40-49). Similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. Wait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many full hundreds there are.\n\nWait, 488 pages mean that we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of these four hundreds, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for four hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times for 4, and 4*10 = 40 times for 8.\n\nNow, what about the remaining 88 pages (401-488)? Let's see. The tens digit in 401-488 goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears in this partial hundred. Specifically, the tens digits are 0 for 401-410 (10 numbers), 1 for 411-420 (10 numbers), ..., up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers (481-488). Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Let's see: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 401-488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, right? 440 is within 401-488, so 440-449 is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all of these, so that's 9 times. Wait, but earlier I thought each hundred had 10 of each, but in this partial hundred, maybe it's different.\n\nWait, no, let's think again. The tens digit in 401-488 goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many numbers have that tens digit?\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488 \u2192 8 numbers\n\nWait, so in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 4*10 (from the four full hundreds) + 10 (from the partial hundred) = 50 times\n- 8 appears 4*10 (from the four full hundreds) + 8 (from the partial hundred) = 48 times\n\nWait, but wait, in the four full hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for both. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total for tens place:\n\n- 4: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. That means in the tens place, there are 2 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it only changes every 100 pages. So, from 1-99, there is no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2, and so on up to 400-488, where it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does each hundreds digit appear? Let's see:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199 \u2192 100 numbers\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299 \u2192 100 numbers\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399 \u2192 100 numbers\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488 \u2192 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488)\n- 8 appears 0 times because there's no 800-899 in 488 pages.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, that's a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- 4: 49\n- 8: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4: 50\n- 8: 48\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4: 89\n- 8: 0\n\nSo, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, units place: 49 each. Tens place: 50 for 4, 48 for 8. Hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for the four full hundreds, each contributes 10 times 4 and 10 times 8. So, 4*10=40 for both. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40+8=48 for 8. That's correct.\n\nIn the units place, each block of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8. There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and a partial block of 8 pages (481-488). Each full block gives 1 each, so 48 each. The partial block gives one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, 48+1=49 each. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nSo, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3. From 400-488, it's 4. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these, so 89 times.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and a partial block (481-488) with 8 pages.\n   - Total 4's: 48 (from full blocks) + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 (from full blocks) + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - Four full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - In 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider how digits are used in page numbers. Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page number is either one, two, or three digits long. \n\nFirst, I should figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's look at each position separately.\n\n1. Units place: The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). In each full block, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. Plus, in the extra 8 pages, does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see, 481-488: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place of the last partial block. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. Tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488. In each full block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 blocks * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 8 for 480-488, but wait, actually, from 401-499, the tens digit cycles again. But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit in 401-488 is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, up to 8 for 480-488. So, does 4 appear in the tens place in this partial block? Yes, from 440-449. That's another 10 times. So total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4, in every block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place: 48 times. Plus, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: In each block of 100, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 times. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, 4's appear 187 times, and 8's appear 98 times. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full blocks + 1 in the last partial block = 49\n- Tens: 4 full blocks *10=40, plus 9 in the last partial block=49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, 49 more 4's than 8's? Wait, no, 187 - 98 is 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4's, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 is only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nFor the units place of 4's, up to 488, it's 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, and in the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, 48 units place 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, plus 488, which is the 49th. So, 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's, so 40, plus in the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49 8's in total.\n\nThus, 187 - 98 = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 89 seems a bit high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit's occurrence in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (once every 10 numbers, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (10 in each of the first four hundreds, plus 10 in 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488 inclusive).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 full tens plus one in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (40 in the first four hundreds plus 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a number from 1 to 488, right? So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I think I should count the number of 4's in each digit place separately: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. The same goes for 8's. That makes sense because the frequency of each digit depends on its position.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once, as does the digit 8. Therefore, the number of 4's in the units place up to a certain number can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and taking the integer part, then adding any extra if the remainder is more than the digit's position.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think of it as total pages divided by 10, which gives the number of complete decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, if there's a remainder, I check if the units digit of the total pages is more than 4 or 8, and add accordingly.\n\nLet me test this with a smaller number first to see if I'm on the right track. Suppose the book has 25 pages. Then, for units digits, from 1 to 25, the units digits go from 1 to 5 twice (1-10 and 11-20) and then 1-5 again (21-25). So, the digit 4 appears twice (at 4 and 14), and 8 doesn't appear in the units place because 8 is beyond 5 in the last partial decade. Wait, but 8 is in the units place only in 8,18,28, etc. So, in 25 pages, 8 would appear twice as well: 8 and 18. So, maybe the method is correct.\n\nWait, but in 25 pages, the units digit counts for 4 would be 2 (4,14) and for 8, it's 2 (8,18). So, the difference would be zero in units place. Hmm, maybe that's a good check.\n\nBut in our problem, the book has 488 pages, so let's apply this method.\n\nFirst, counting 4's in the units place:\n\nTotal pages = 488.\n\nNumber of complete decades (groups of 10) = 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 complete decades, with a remainder of 8 pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8).\n\nEach complete decade contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 decades would contribute 48 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, does 4 appear in these? Yes, at 484. So, that's one more 4. Does 8 appear? Yes, at 488. So, that's one more 8.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, the difference in units place is 49 - 49 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Now, moving on to the tens place.\n\nFor the tens digit, the same idea applies but with groups of 100. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nNow, let's calculate for 488 pages.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds = 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 complete hundreds, with a remainder of 88 pages (since 4*100=400, and 488-400=88).\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would contribute 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) need to be considered for the tens digit.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). Wait, no, actually, 401-410 would have a tens digit of 0, 411-420 would have 1, and so on up to 481-490 having 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages with tens digit 8.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages. Let's break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages? It appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in the tens place in 481-488, which is 8 pages (from 481 to 488 inclusive), so 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from remaining) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from remaining) = 48.\n\nSo, the difference in tens place is 50 - 48 = +2. So, 4's are more by 2 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds digit is only relevant for numbers 100 and above. Since our book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nLet's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: from 100-199: 100 numbers, so 100 times.\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299: 100 times.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399: 100 times.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488: 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89).\n\nWait, let me check that: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? 89 times (from 400-488).\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, in 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, the difference in hundreds place is 89 - 0 = +89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place:\n\n- Units place: 0\n- Tens place: +2\n- Hundreds place: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of complete decades: 48, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8 in units place. So, 48 each.\n\nRemaining pages: 481-488, which is 8 pages. In units place, 4 appears at 484, and 8 at 488. So, 1 each. So, total 4's in units: 48+1=49, 8's:48+1=49. Difference 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nComplete hundreds: 4, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in tens place. So, 40 each.\n\nRemaining 88 pages: 401-488.\n\nLooking at tens digits:\n\n401-410: tens digit 0\n411-420: 1\n421-430:2\n431-440:3\n441-450:4 (10 numbers)\n451-460:5\n461-470:6\n471-480:7\n481-488:8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 10 times (441-450)\n8's in tens place: 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50\n8's: 40 +8=48\nDifference: +2. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n400-488: 89 numbers, hundreds digit 4. So, 89 4's.\n8's in hundreds place: none, since 800-899 would be needed, but we only go up to 488. So, 0.\nDifference: +89.\n\nAdding up: 0 (units) +2 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =91.\n\nSo, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I'm counting correctly? Let me consider if in the hundreds place, the 4's are only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 441-450, and 8 appears 8 times in 481-488. So, 10 vs 8, so 2 more 4's.\n\nUnits place, both have 49 each, so no difference.\n\nSo, total difference is 89+2=91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to check: maybe I should calculate total number of 4's and total number of 8's across all digit places, then subtract.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:50\nHundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:48\nHundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, same result. So, that seems correct.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full blocks, contributing 48 each.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Difference: 0\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 full blocks, contributing 40 each.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n   - Difference: +2\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - Difference: +89\n\n**Total Difference:**\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +2\n- Hundreds: +89\n- **Total: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91**\n\nThus, 91 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider how often the digits 4 and 8 appear in each place: units, tens, hundreds. \n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many times each digit appears in the units place, then in the tens place, and then in the hundreds place. Then, I can sum them up for each digit and find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For any set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, in the entire book, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times. But wait, the last 8 pages (481 to 488) will have units digits from 1 to 8, so 4 and 8 each appear once more in the units place. So, the total for units place would be 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8, right? So, for 4, in the units place, it's 48 times (from 4, 14, 24,...484) and then in the extra 8 pages, 481 to 488, 484 is included, so that's one more 4. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times (8,18,28,...488) and in the extra 8 pages, 488 is included, so that's one more 8. So, units place: 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nWait, but 488 is page 488, so the units digit is 8, so 8 appears once more. So, units place: 49 for 4, and 49 for 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds, and then 88 pages. \n\nSo, in the tens place, each digit appears 4 times 10 = 40 times. But wait, let me think again. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 400 pages, it's 4 times 10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Let's see, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0, so no. 411-420, tens digit is 1, no. Wait, no, wait, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: 1, 421-430: 2, 431-440: 3, 441-450: 4, 451-460:5, 461-470:6, 471-480:7, 481-488:8. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 441-450, that's 10 times. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear? From 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages (481-488), so 8 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place: 4's appear 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50 times. 8's appear 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. In the first 400 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place, correct. Then, in 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, for 4 in the tens place, it's only in 441-450, which is 10 pages. For 8, it's in 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, yes, 50 for 4 and 48 for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles every 1000, but since our book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Units place: 49 for 4, 49 for 8.\n- Tens place: 50 for 4, 48 for 8.\n- Hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nNow, total number of 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, for the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8. Let me confirm that. Each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages (since 480/10=48). Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 48 +1=49 for 4, and 48 +1=49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For 4, I had 50 times, which is 40 from the first 400 pages, and 10 from 441-450. For 8, 40 from the first 400 pages, and 8 from 481-488. So, 50 vs 48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 appears 0 times. So, 89 vs 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188. 8's:49+48+0=97. Difference: 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those. So, 89 times. Correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:48\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since page numbers go from 1 to 488, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two totals.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the units place. For the units digit, each number from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten pages. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten, and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each complete set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for the units place, 48 sets would give 48 fours and 48 eights. But wait, the last partial set is 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. In this partial set, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights. That means the difference in units place is zero. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For each hundred, the digits 0-9 appear in the tens place for ten consecutive pages each. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 10 pages, 1 for 10, and so on up to 9 for 10 pages. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages, and the same for 8. Now, how many hundreds do we have in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, for each of the first 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, so that's 4*10 = 40 fours. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4*10 = 40 eights. Now, we have the last partial hundred: 401-488. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. The tens digit in 401-409 is 0, 410-419 is 1, 420-429 is 2, 430-439 is 3, 440-449 is 4, 450-459 is 5, 460-469 is 6, 470-479 is 7, 480-488 is 8. So, in the tens place for 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? From 440-449, that's 10 pages, so 10 fours. How about 8? From 480-488, that's 9 pages (since 488 is the last page), so 9 eights. So, adding that to the previous counts: fours in tens place are 40 + 10 = 50, and eights are 40 + 9 = 49. So, the tens place gives us 50 fours and 49 eights, meaning 1 more four than eight.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4. So, for pages 1-99, hundreds digit is 0, but since we're starting at page 1, maybe it's 1? Wait, no, page 1 is just 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times, because each page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 fours and 0 eights. That's a big difference here.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor eights:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is total fours minus total eights: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 488 pages. Each ten pages have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have 484 and 488, so that's two more digits: 4 and 8. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. Correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 fours and 10 eights. So, 4 hundreds would give 40 each. Then, the last partial hundred from 401-488: the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours. The tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights. So, total tens place: fours = 40 + 10 = 50, eights = 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 fours. No eights in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference in hundreds place was 89, but when adding up, it's 89 fours and 0 eights, which is 89 more fours. Then, in the tens place, fours are 1 more, and units place zero. So total difference is 89 + 1 = 90. That seems right.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each ten pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contain one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full tens and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n- Full tens: 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n- Extra pages: 484 (one '4') and 488 (one '8').\n- Total: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred pages (e.g., 1-100) have ten '4's and ten '8's in the tens place.\n- 488 pages mean 4 full hundreds and a partial hundred (401-488).\n- Full hundreds: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n- Partial hundred (401-488):\n  - '4' in tens place: 440-449 (10 '4's).\n  - '8' in tens place: 480-488 (9 '8's).\n- Total: 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place, totaling 89 '4's.\n- No '8's in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured. Each page has a number from 1 to 488, so each digit from 1 to 9 and then into the hundreds. I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nFirst, maybe I should consider the digits separately. So, I'll look at the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately for both digits 4 and 8. That way, I can systematically count each occurrence.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's consider each position one by one.\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many times does this happen? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 full groups of 10 and a remainder of 8. So, in each group of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. That would be 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), does 484 fall into this? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's one more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens plus one if the units digit goes beyond 4 in the last partial ten. Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are and then see if there's an extra 4 in the units place.\n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 is included once (484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens digit. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 0-488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, but 450-488 is beyond 449. So, the blocks are:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nSo that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So total tens place 4's: 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, similar to 4, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but only up to 488.\n\nSo, how many blocks are there?\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488)\n\nWait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the last block contributes 9 instead of 10.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus the last block 480-488 contributing 9. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check. 80-89: yes, 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 8's in the tens place were 49, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, the tens place for 8: 80-89 is 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10. And 480-488 contributes 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, yes, 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But that seems high. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the 4's and 8's again.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 488 / 10 = 48 with remainder 8. So, 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in units place, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, so that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The 4 in the tens place occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: Similarly, 488 / 10 = 48 with remainder 8. So, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in units place, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, so that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place, so 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: As the book ends at 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like 90 might be too high. Let me check if I'm counting correctly.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe using a formula for digit counting. The number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated using a method where you consider each digit position separately, as I did, but perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nWait, for 4's in the hundreds place, numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 8's, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's each, so 40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 50 4's. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits: 49 each. So, total 4's: 188, 8's: 98. Difference: 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, there might be overlaps or something I'm missing. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's by considering each digit position separately and using a formula.\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet's denote the current position as the i-th digit (starting from the right, with units as position 1, tens as position 2, etc.).\n\nFor each position, we can split the number into higher, current, and lower parts.\n\nThe formula is a bit involved, but perhaps for this problem, since the number is only 488, it's manageable to do manually.\n\nBut maybe I can stick with my initial method since it seems systematic.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write out the counts for each digit position again to confirm.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumbers ending with 4: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n\nHow many such numbers? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n\nEach block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumbers where the hundreds digit is 4: 400-488. That's 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumbers ending with 8: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n\nFrom 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n\nEach of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumbers where the hundreds digit is 8: 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so none. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again: 188 4's and 98 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nBut I'm a bit concerned because sometimes in digit counting, especially when the higher digits are involved, you might have to adjust for numbers beyond a certain point. For example, when counting 4's in the hundreds place, we have 400-488, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is correct as it's 9 numbers.\n\nWait, maybe I can cross-verify by considering a smaller number. Let's say a 100-page book. How many 4's and 8's would there be?\n\nIn a 100-page book:\n\n4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: 10 times.\n\nTens place: 40-49: 10 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0 (since 100 is the last page, but 100 doesn't have a hundreds digit of 4).\n\nTotal 4's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98: 10 times.\n\nTens place: 80-89: 10 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nDifference: 20 - 20 = 0. That seems correct because in 1-100, the number of 4's and 8's should be equal.\n\nWait, but in reality, from 1-100, the 4's in the units place are 10, and in the tens place 10, making 20. Similarly for 8's. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother test: 200-page book.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits: 4,14,...,194: 20 times (since 200/10=20).\n\nTens: 40-49,140-149: 2 blocks, 10 each, so 20.\n\nHundreds: 400-499, but 200 is less than 400, so 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 20 + 20 = 40.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits: 8,18,...,198: 20 times.\n\nTens: 80-89,180-189: 2 blocks, 10 each, so 20.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 20 + 20 = 40.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nWait, but in a 200-page book, the difference is 0. Hmm, but in our problem, it's 488, which is more than 400, so the hundreds place comes into play for 4's but not for 8's. So, that's why the difference arises.\n\nWait, another test: 450-page book.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits: 4,14,...,444: 45 times (since 450/10=45).\n\nTens: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50.\n\nHundreds: 400-450: 51 numbers (since 450 - 400 +1 = 51).\n\nTotal 4's: 45 + 50 + 51 = 146.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits: 8,18,...,448: 45 times (since 450/10=45).\n\nTens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-489. But 480-489 is beyond 450, so only up to 480-480 if 450 is the limit. Wait, no, 480 is beyond 450, so the last block is 380-389. So, 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 45 + 40 = 85.\n\nDifference: 146 - 85 = 61.\n\nWait, but in this case, the hundreds place for 4's adds 51, but for 8's, nothing, so the difference increases.\n\nSo, going back, in our problem, the hundreds place adds 89 4's, which is a significant number, leading to a higher count for 4's compared to 8's.\n\nThus, I think my initial calculation is correct: 188 4's and 98 8's, difference of 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nAnd 8's in the tens place: up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my answer is correct: 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit position (units, tens, hundreds). \n\n- **Units place**: 4 appears 49 times.\n- **Tens place**: 4 appears 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place**: 4 appears 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- **Units place**: 8 appears 49 times.\n- **Tens place**: 8 appears 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place**: 8 does not appear.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately, like units and tens, because page numbers can be one, two, or three digits long. \n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears once, and so does the digit 8. For example, pages 4, 14, 24, etc., have a 4 in the units place, and pages 8, 18, 28, etc., have an 8. \n\nNow, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten and then 8 extra pages. So, in each full group, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 groups \u00d7 1 = 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. Now, the extra 8 pages (481 to 488) would have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in these, the units digit 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So, adding that, the units place gives us 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4 and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. Wait, but that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the extra pages are 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. Let me check: units digits in 481-488 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, units place: 49 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nWait, but that seems like they are equal, so maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again. If I have 48 full groups of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, that's 48 each. Then, the last partial group of 8 pages (481-488) adds one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. So, in the units place, they are equal. Hmm, so maybe the difference comes from the tens place.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, for each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times per hundred. So, for the digit 4, in the tens place, it appears 10 times in every 100 pages, same with 8.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so maybe I should break it down differently. Let me think: from 1 to 488, the hundreds places go up to 4 (since 400-499 is the range, but we stop at 488). So, in each hundred block, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nSo, how many full hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of the four hundreds, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times each. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear here?\n\nWait, the tens digit in 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear? For each tens digit, there are 10 pages, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. Wait, 401-488: let's see, 401-410: tens digit 0, 411-420: tens digit 1, ..., 481-490: tens digit 8, but we only go up to 488, which is 8 pages (481-488). So, for tens digits 0-7, each appears 10 times, and for tens digit 8, it appears 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many times does 4 appear? Well, 4 in the tens place would be when the tens digit is 4, which is pages 441-450. Wait, no, 441-450 would be in the 401-488 range. Wait, no, 441-450 is within 401-488, right? Because 450 is less than 488. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in 441-450. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in pages 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so that's 8 pages, so 8 times for the digit 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times. So, in the tens place across the entire book, 4 appears 4 full hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 times, plus 10 times in the last partial hundred, totaling 50 times. For 8, it's 4 full hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 times, plus 8 times in the last partial hundred, totaling 48 times.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me check again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 481-490, but we only have up to 488, so that's 8 pages, so 8 times. So, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times. So, that's a difference of 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this book. So, for each page from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (since they're two-digit numbers), but I think we can consider it as not present. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, let's tally up the totals:\n\n- Units place: 49 times for 4, 49 times for 8.\n- Tens place: 50 times for 4, 48 times for 8.\n- Hundreds place: 89 times for 4, 0 times for 8.\n\nNow, adding them all up:\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I thought both 4 and 8 appeared 49 times. Then, in the tens place, 4 appeared 50 times, 8 appeared 48 times. In the hundreds place, 4 appeared 89 times, 8 appeared 0 times. So, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, which is correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the units place, from 1-488, every 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. There are 48 full groups of 10, which is 480 pages, giving 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 49 each.\n\nSo, yeah, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 97, difference is 91. So, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me recount the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-400, each hundred has 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40 each. Then, from 401-488, tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (441-450), and 8 occurs 8 times (481-488). So, total tens place: 40+10=50 for 4, 40+8=48 for 8. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups of 10, so 48 each, plus in the last 8 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once, so 49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can think of another way to calculate this. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nCalculating the number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: For every 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, 488 pages / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once (484). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: For every 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times. So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, number of 8's:\n\n- Units place: Same as 4's, 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages, 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: For every 100 pages, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds, 4\u00d710=40. In the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, 8 times. So, total tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n- Hundreds place: 8 never appears because the book only goes up to 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Number of full groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - 4 and 8 each appear 48 times in the units place.\n   - In the last 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Number of full hundreds in 488 pages: 4 (1-400).\n   - 4 and 8 each appear 4\u00d710 = 40 times in the tens place.\n   - In the last 88 pages (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4; 40 + 8 = 48 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99: Hundreds digit is 0 (not counted).\n   - Pages 100-199: Hundreds digit is 1.\n   - Pages 200-299: Hundreds digit is 2.\n   - Pages 300-399: Hundreds digit is 3.\n   - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place: 89 for 4; 0 for 8.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers are 1-9 (one-digit), 10-99 (two-digit), 100-488 (three-digit). Maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges separately.\n\nStarting with the one-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. In this range, the digits are just 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, how many 4's are there? Only one, which is the number 4 itself. Similarly, how many 8's? Only one, which is the number 8. So, in one-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear once each.\n\nNow, moving on to two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. Here, each number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the tens place and the units place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place for 4's: The tens digit is 4. So, the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers, the 4 can appear in any number where the units digit is 4. So, for each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each ten's group, there's exactly one number where the units digit is 4. There are 9 ten's groups (10-99), so that's 9 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nSo, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nSimilarly, let's calculate the number of 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nFor the tens place: The tens digit is 8, so numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place: Similar to 4's, in each ten's group, the units digit is 8 once. So, 9 ten's groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 9 times.\n\nThus, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nWait, so in two-digit numbers, both 4's and 8's appear 19 times each? That seems correct because the structure is the same for both digits.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. This might be a bit more complex because now we have hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nLet me handle the 4's and 8's separately again.\n\nStarting with 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, let's see when the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nNumbers from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, the tens place: The tens digit can be 0-9, but we need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nWait, but actually, for three-digit numbers, the tens and units places can vary, so perhaps I should break it down more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the number of 4's in each place (hundreds, tens, units) separately.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nHundreds place: As established, 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nEach hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has a tens digit that cycles from 0-9 every ten numbers.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs in the range 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. However, since we only go up to 488, the last group for 440-449 is complete, but 480-488 is only part of the next group.\n\nWait, no, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's a full ten numbers. But for the hundreds 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has a full set of tens digits, including 4.\n\nSo, for each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). So that's 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 times.\n\nThen, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nNow, units place: How many times does 4 appear in the units place in three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every ten numbers. So, in each hundred, the units digit 4 appears once every ten numbers.\n\nSo, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the units digit 4 appears 10 times each (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194; same for 204, 214, ..., 294; and 304, 314, ..., 394). So that's 3 \u00d7 10 = 30.\n\nIn the 400-488 range, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, let's count: from 400 to 488, how many numbers have units digit 4?\n\nStarting at 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's: 30 (from first three hundreds) + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the 400-488 range, the units digit 4 occurs every 10 numbers starting from 404. So, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, correct. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 units digit 4's, so 3\u00d710=30, correct. Then 400-488 adds 9, so 39 total.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check if I did that correctly.\n\nWait, 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. Hmm, maybe that's correct, but let me cross-verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of 4's in each position for three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 140-149, etc.), so 3\u00d710=30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, 30+10=40. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: Each hundred has 10 units digit 4's, so 3\u00d710=30. Then, in 400-488, from 404 to 484, stepping by 10, that's 9 numbers, so 9. So, 30+9=39. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is in 800-899. But our book ends at 488, so there are no three-digit numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: How many times does 8 appear in the tens place in three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 3\u00d710=30.\n\nIn the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, but wait, 480-489 would be the full range, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's 9.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nUnits place: How many times does 8 appear in the units place in three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the units digit 8 appears once every ten numbers, so 10 times per hundred, so 3\u00d710=30.\n\nIn the 400-488 range, the units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, 9.\n\nThus, total units place 8's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but wait a second: in the 400-488 range, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is included, so units digit 8 appears at 488. So, that's correct, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (0) + tens place (39) + units place (39) = 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. So, tens place is 39, units place is 39, so total 78. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across all page numbers.\n\nFirst, let's tally up all the 4's:\n\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nNow, total 8's:\n\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's total 188 and 8's total 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go through the three-digit counts again because that's where most of the numbers are.\n\nFor 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n- Tens place: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 each have 10 4's in the tens place, so 3\u00d710=30. Then, 440-449 is another 10, so 30+10=40.\n- Units place: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 each have 10 4's in the units place, so 3\u00d710=30. Then, 404, 414,...,484 is 9 numbers, so 30+9=39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n- Tens place: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 each have 10 8's in the tens place, so 3\u00d710=30. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 30+9=39.\n- Units place: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 each have 10 8's in the units place, so 3\u00d710=30. Then, 408, 418,...,488 is 9 numbers, so 30+9=39.\n\nSo, 0+39+39=78. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like 90 is a big number. Let me check if I counted correctly in the three-digit numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nFor three-digit numbers from 100 to 488:\n\nNumber of numbers: 488 - 100 + 1 = 389.\n\nBut that might not help directly. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, for the hundreds place in three-digit numbers:\n\nDigits can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. For each hundreds digit, the number of times it appears is as follows:\n\n- 1: 100-199: 100 numbers, so 100 times.\n- 2: 200-299: 100 times.\n- 3: 300-399: 100 times.\n- 4: 400-488: 89 times.\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, which matches my earlier count.\n\nFor the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\nEach hundreds group (100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers for each tens digit (0-9). So, for each hundreds group, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place. So, 3\u00d710=30 for both 4 and 8.\n\nThen, for 400-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8 (since 488 is the last number). So, for tens digit 4 in 400-488: numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor tens digit 8 in 400-488: numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nThat matches my earlier count.\n\nFor the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\nEach hundreds group (100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers for each units digit (0-9). So, in each hundreds group, each digit appears 10 times in the units place.\n\nThus, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the units place, so 3\u00d710=30 for both.\n\nThen, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, ..., 484, which is 9 numbers (since 484 is the last one before 488). So, 9 times 4 in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, ..., 488, which is 9 numbers (including 488). So, 9 times 8 in the units place.\n\nThus, total units place 4's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nTotal units place 8's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier counts.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. In the three-digit numbers, when counting the units digit 4's in 400-488, I included 484, which is correct because 484 is less than 488. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, 488 is included, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if in the three-digit numbers, the count for 4's in the units place is correct. From 400-488, how many numbers end with 4?\n\nStarting at 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, yes, 9 each.\n\nTherefore, I think my counts are correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just cross-verify once more. Maybe I can use another approach to calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position across all page numbers.\n\nFor the one-digit numbers (1-9):\n\n- 4 appears once.\n- 8 appears once.\n\nFor two-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- Each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times in the tens place (since for each tens digit, there are 10 numbers, and there are 9 possible tens digits from 1-9). Wait, actually, no. Wait, in the tens place, digits 1-9 each appear 10 times (e.g., 10-19 have tens digit 1, etc.), so 10 times each. Similarly, in the units place, each digit 0-9 appears 9 times (since for each tens group, digits 0-9 appear once, and there are 9 tens groups from 1-9). Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, in two-digit numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit. So, for each digit in the units place, it appears 9 times (once for each tens group). Similarly, for the tens place, each digit from 1-9 appears 10 times.\n\nWait, so for two-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: digits 1-9 each appear 10 times.\n- Units place: digits 0-9 each appear 9 times.\n\nSo, for digit 4:\n\n- Tens place: 10 times.\n- Units place: 9 times.\nTotal: 19.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8:\n\n- Tens place: 10 times.\n- Units place: 9 times.\nTotal: 19.\n\nWhich matches my earlier count.\n\nNow, for three-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nWe can break it down into hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Digit 1 appears 100 times (100-199).\n- Digit 2 appears 100 times (200-299).\n- Digit 3 appears 100 times (300-399).\n- Digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has 10 numbers for each tens digit (0-9). So, for each hundreds group, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut for the last group, 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, since 488 is the last number. So, for tens digit 8 in 400-488, it appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for units place:\n\nEach hundreds group has 10 numbers for each units digit, but in the last group, 400-488, the units digits go up to 8 in the case of 488.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate each digit's appearance in each position.\n\nBut I think I've already done this, so maybe I can just stick with my previous count.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- 4 appears 40 times in the tens place.\n- 4 appears 39 times in the units place.\nTotal: 168.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears:\n\n- 0 times in the hundreds place.\n- 39 times in the tens place.\n- 39 times in the units place.\nTotal: 78.\n\nAdding the one-digit and two-digit counts:\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\n1. **One-digit page numbers (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once.\n   - 8 appears once.\n\n2. **Two-digit page numbers (10-99):**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place and 9 times in the units place.\n   - 4 appears 19 times (10 in tens, 9 in units).\n   - 8 appears 19 times (10 in tens, 9 in units).\n\n3. **Three-digit page numbers (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - 4 appears 40 times (10 in each of the first three hundreds, plus 10 in 440-449).\n     - 8 appears 39 times (10 in each of the first three hundreds, plus 9 in 480-488).\n   - **Units place:**\n     - 4 appears 39 times (10 in each of the first three hundreds, plus 9 in 404, 414, etc.).\n     - 8 appears 39 times (10 in each of the first three hundreds, plus 9 in 408, 418, etc.).\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n- Total 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since page numbers go from 1 to 488, I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then subtract the two totals.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit appears once. Since the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, for the units digit, the number of 4's is 48 and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, there's that partial block from 481 to 488. Let me check those: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. In the units place here, we have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding those, units place gives us 49 4's and 49 8's. Wait, that can't be right because 48 complete blocks plus 1 more in the partial block for each digit. Wait, no, because 48 blocks would give 48 4's and 48 8's, then the partial block gives 1 each, so total units digits: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, in each 100-page block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 400 pages would be 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Then, from 401 to 488, that's 88 pages, which is less than a full hundred. \n\nSo, for each complete hundred, we have 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 4's and 40 8's. Now, looking at the partial hundred from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 401-410 have tens digit 0, 411-420 have 1, and so on up to 481-490 having 8, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit for 481-488 is 8). So, in the tens place for 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? Well, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. But wait, from 401 to 488, 440-449 is within that range, right? So, that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 4's in the tens place. \n\nWhat about 8 in the tens place? That would be from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, in the tens place, the total 4's are 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. And the total 8's are 40 (from the four hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, let's move to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (if we consider it, but usually, page numbers don't have leading zeros, so maybe the hundreds digit isn't counted for pages less than 100. So, in pages 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so 4 doesn't appear in the hundreds place there. Starting from page 100, the hundreds digit is 1, then 2, 3, and 4 from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). \n\nAs for the hundreds digit 8, since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8; the highest is 4. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is zero.\n\nSo, adding up all the digits:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place: 488 pages, so units digit cycles every 10. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute 1 more 4 (484) and 1 more 8 (488). So, 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. 4 hundreds (1-400) give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449 (10 times) and 8 from 480-488 (9 times). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's from 400-488: 89 times. 8's: 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 for 4's. 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 for 8's. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For 4's, we have:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - 488 pages mean 48 full cycles of 10, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 49, Total 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 400 pages contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Pages 401-488: 4's appear 10 times (440-449), 8's appear 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 50, Total 8's: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's appear 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8's appear 0 times.\n   - Total 4's: 89, Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider how often the digits 4 and 8 appear in each place: units, tens, hundreds. That might help me count them separately and then compare.\n\nFirst, let's think about the units place. For every block of 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each block, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So, for the units place, how many times does each digit appear?\n\nThe book has 488 pages, so the number of complete tens is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 complete tens, and then 8 extra pages (since 48*10=480, so pages 481 to 488 are the extra). \n\nWait, but for the units digit, each complete ten contributes one 4 and one 8. So, 48 complete tens would give 48 fours and 48 eights. But then we have the extra 8 pages from 481 to 488. Let me check those: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So in these extra pages, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and the units digit 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, total units place fours: 48 + 1 = 49. Units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they're equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times, and 8 in 80-89, also 10 times. So, in each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut how many hundreds do we have in 488 pages? Let's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then an extra 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, that's 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights.\n\nNow, the extra 88 pages: 401-488. Let's look at the tens digit here. From 401-409: tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8. 410-419: tens digit 1, no. 420-429: tens digit 2, no. 430-439: tens digit 3, no. 440-449: tens digit 4, which is 10 pages. 450-459: tens digit 5, no. 460-469: tens digit 6, no. 470-479: tens digit 7, no. 480-488: tens digit 8, which is 9 pages (480-488 is 9 pages, right? Wait, 488-480=8, so 9 pages including both ends).\n\nWait, let me correct that: 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the extra 88 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the extra part, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nTherefore, total tens place fours: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50. Tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 has one more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages 400-488, right? So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nWhat about the hundreds digit for 8? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 never appears.\n\nTherefore, hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the extra pages 481-488 contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens digit. 4 hundreds, so 40 each. Then, the extra 88 pages: 440-449 gives 10 fours, and 480-488 gives 9 eights. So, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when considering the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred, but in the last partial hundred, it's 400-488, so the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last). Wait, no, from 400-409, tens digit is 0; 410-419 is 1; up to 480-488, which is tens digit 8, but only 9 pages. So, in the tens place, for the last partial hundred, 440-449 is 10 fours, and 480-488 is 9 eights. So, that part is correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if the hundreds place is correctly accounted for. From 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so no 4's or 8's. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 pages, as calculated.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but I feel like this might be correct, but let me think if there's another way to approach it. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAlternatively, I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last page is >= 484, which it is (488), so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last page is >= 488, which it is, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, units digit: 49 each.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100) = 4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Plus, in the last partial hundred (400-488), how many tens digits are 4? From 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more. So, total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/100) = 4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 pages (tens digit 8), so 9 more. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: none, since 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages), giving 48 each.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (400 pages), giving 40 each.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's.\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider how often the digits 4 and 8 appear in each place: units, tens, and hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. I should probably count the occurrences of 4 and 8 separately in each digit position and then compare them.\n\nFirst, let's think about the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. That means, for the units digit, the number of 4's and 8's should be equal, right? So in the units place, both 4 and 8 will appear the same number of times.\n\nNow, let's figure out how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages. Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole sets, there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages, and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each of these 48 sets, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So that's 48 times each. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So the units place contributes equally to both digits, 49 times each.\n\nOkay, so units place is tied with both digits appearing 49 times. Now, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. Similarly, from 100-199, the tens digit cycles again 0-9 ten times each, and so on.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the digit in the tens place appears 10 times. Let's figure out how many hundreds we have in 488 pages. Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So we have four complete hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488, which is 89 pages. So for each of the four full hundreds, the digit in the tens place cycles 0-9 ten times each. So in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 ten times and 8 ten times. So in four hundreds, 4 appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 4*10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining pages from 400 to 488. The tens digit here cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So let's see, from 400-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, tens digit is 1; ... up to 480-488, which is tens digit 8. So how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here?\n\nIn the tens place for 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409 (10 pages), 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488 (9 pages, since 488 is the end). So the digit 4 in the tens place occurs only once, from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So that's 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place occurs from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but I thought the tens digit for 480-488 is 8, but since 488 is the last page, it's only 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo putting it all together, in the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 40 times (from the four full hundreds) plus 10 times (from 440-449) = 50 times.\n- 8 appears 40 times (from the four full hundreds) plus 9 times (from 480-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 at maximum, not 8. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so yes, 4 appears 89 times. 8 would require the hundreds digit to be 8, which would start at page 800, but the book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So 8's count in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but that seems like 4 appears 188 times and 8 appears 98 times, so the difference is 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the tens place, I had 4 appearing 50 times and 8 appearing 49 times. Let me recount that. In the four full hundreds, each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So 4*10=40 for 4 and 4*10=40 for 8. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, as from 400-488, which is 89 pages. 8 doesn't appear at all in the hundreds place, so that's 0.\n\nUnits place: Both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 for 4's. 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 for 8's.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount the partial sets.\n\nWait, let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 pages, 4 appears once. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Similarly, 8 appears once in each full set (48 times) and once in the remaining pages (488), so 48 + 1 = 49 times. So units place is correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so four hundreds give 40 times. Then in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So 40 + 10 = 50. For 8, in each hundred, 10 times, so four hundreds give 40 times. In 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So 40 + 9 = 49. So that's correct.\n\nHundreds place: Only from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times for 4. 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 488 pages, so the last page is 488. So when counting from 400-488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but how many times does each digit appear? Let me think: for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 pages\n410-419: tens digit 1, 10 pages\n...\n470-479: tens digit 7, 10 pages\n480-488: tens digit 8, 9 pages\n\nSo for tens digits 0-7, each appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo for 4 in the tens place, it's when the tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages (440-449). So 10 times. For 8 in the tens place, it's when the tens digit is 8, which is 9 pages (480-488). So that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine.\n\nSo, yes, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially with partial hundreds, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me just verify the counts again.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus one in the remaining pages at 488, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens digit:\n\nFor each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Four hundreds: 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (400-488), 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: four hundreds contribute 4*10=40 times. In the last partial hundred, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\n4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0 times.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n   - Remaining pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (at 484) and one 8 (at 488).\n   - Count: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred.\n   - Four full hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - In 400-488:\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Count: 4's = 50, 8's = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear.\n   - Count: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference**: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. That might make it easier to count the occurrences of each digit.\n\nFirst, I should think about how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers will be from 1 up to 488, which is a three-digit number.\n\nI think I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many times does 4 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Well, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (from 481 to 488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is included, which adds another 4. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these sets contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such sets there are. From 0-488, we have 400-488, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another set. So, how many sets? Let's see: 40-49 (1 set), 140-149 (another), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems right.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, 400 is page 400, and 488 is the last page. So, how many hundreds digits are 4? It's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place is 49, tens place is 50, hundreds place is 89. So total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89.\n\nLet me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. That's 48 times. Now, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit 8 appears once more. So, total units place 8's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, the ranges where the tens digit is 8 are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Let's count how many such sets.\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers)\n\nWait, so each of the first four sets contributes 10, and the last set contributes 9. So total tens place 8's = 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 from page 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So total 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, we had 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place for 8's.\n\nThe ranges where the tens digit is 8 are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times the tens digit is 8. So, yes, 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because 90 seems a bit high. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nLet me go back to counting the 4's.\n\nUnits place: 49. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for 4's. The ranges are:\n\n- 40-49: 10\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nWait, that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, that's correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nNumber of complete decades (sets of 10) is 48 (since 488 /10 = 48.8). Each decade contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the difference might be smaller, but maybe it's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of each digit place separately and calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- Number of 4's: floor(488 / 10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, no, actually, it's better to think as (n // 10) + (1 if n % 10 >= digit else 0). But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe a formula approach would help. For each digit place, the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated as:\n\nFor units place:\nnumber of times = (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0) if d != 0.\n\nBut since we're dealing with digits 4 and 8, which are non-zero, maybe that formula applies.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to just stick with my initial counting.\n\nWait, another approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 4: As before, 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, and the last partial decade (481-488) includes 484, so 49 times.\n\n- For 8: Similarly, 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and the last partial decade includes 488, so 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4: 5 sets of 100 where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50 times.\n\n- For 8: 5 sets of 100 where the tens digit is 8, each contributing 10 numbers, except the last set which is 480-488, contributing 9, so total 49 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n- For 8: No numbers, since the book ends at 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because I feel like 90 might be a large difference, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, let me think about the hundreds place again. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's a significant contribution to the count of 4's.\n\nIn contrast, for 8's, the hundreds digit never appears, so that's 0. So, the 4's have a big advantage in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, both digits 4 and 8 have similar counts: 50 vs 49. So, 4's have one more in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place, both have 49 each, so no difference there.\n\nSo, the difference comes mainly from the hundreds place: 89 (for 4's) and 0 (for 8's), plus one more in the tens place.\n\nSo, 89 + 1 = 90. That makes sense.\n\nI think I can conclude that the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n### Counting the digit 4:\n1. **Units place**: \n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences. The last partial set (481-488) includes 484, adding one more. Total: 49.\n   \n2. **Tens place**: \n   - The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences. Total: 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: \n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 separately.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, each page number is a one, two, or three-digit number. I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10 pages, and then an extra 8 pages. In each of those 48 blocks, the units digit 4 and 8 each appear once, so that's 48 times for each. Now, in the extra 8 pages (from 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, in total, for the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times as well. Wait, so they're equal in the units place? That's interesting.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, in each block of 100 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each block, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. How many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). In each of those 4 hundreds, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. Now, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once (440-449) and 8 appears once (480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's from 480-488). Wait, actually, in the tens place for 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, that's 10 pages, so the tens digit is 4 ten times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 nine times. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 pages, but we only have up to 488, so it's 9 pages. So, in the tens place for the extra 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, in the tens place overall, 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, 4 appears one more time in the tens place.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Let's see, from page 1 to 99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's zero. From 100 to 199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200 to 299, it's 2. From 300 to 399, it's 3. From 400 to 488, it's 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400 to 488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit:\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each full hundred contributes 10 times each for 4 and 8. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, total for 4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal for 8: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 in each of those pages, so 89 times. That seems right.\n\nAnother way to check: let's count the total number of digits. From 1 to 488, how many digits are there? Pages 1-9: 9 pages, 1 digit each: 9 digits. Pages 10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each: 180 digits. Pages 100-488: 488 - 99 = 389 pages, 3 digits each: 389 * 3 = 1167 digits. Total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, total number of 4's: 188. Total number of 8's: 98. So, 188 +98=286 digits accounted for. 1356 -286=1070 digits for other numbers. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should recount the tens place. Let me see: in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for each ten's digit, how many times does it appear? For 0: 10 times (401-410), but wait, 401-410 is 10 pages, so the tens digit is 0 for 10 pages. Similarly, for 1: 10 pages (411-420), and so on up to 8: 9 pages (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, yes, 10 and 9 respectively. So, the earlier calculation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (480 pages), contributing 48 each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 and one 8.\n   - **Total:** 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - Four full hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - The last 88 pages (401-488) add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's.\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total:** 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how digits are used in page numbers. Each page number can be 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, or 4-digit, but since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a 3-digit number. So, I don't need to consider 4-digit numbers here.\n\nFirst, I should probably consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the total counts for 4 and 8, I can subtract the two to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's look at each position one by one.\n\n1. **Units place (the first digit from the right):**\n   - The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, there are 488 numbers. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full blocks of 10, and then there are 8 remaining numbers (481 to 488). In each of the 48 blocks, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. In the remaining 8 numbers, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place (the second digit from the right):**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - For 488 pages, how many full blocks of 100 are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full blocks (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, not a full 100. So, let me adjust that.\n   - Each full block of 100 (like 1-100, 201-300, 301-400) contributes 10 4's in the tens place. There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each giving 10 4's, so that's 4*10=40.\n   - Now, the last partial block is 401-488. How many numbers here have 4 in the tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 4's.\n   - Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from full blocks) +10=50.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-100: 40-49, so 10 4's in tens place. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, actually, from 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 488 is beyond 400, so 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (the third digit from the right):**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 +89=187. So, total 4's: 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more (at 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each full block (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 full blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each gives 10, so 4*10=40.\n   - The last partial block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, the tens digit is 8 here for 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? Because 480 is 4-8-0, 481 is 4-8-1, up to 488, which is 4-8-8. So, that's 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place for 8's was 49, and tens was 49, so 98 total. But let me check again:\n\nWait, when I calculated units place for 8's, I had 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, and then the last 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, tens place: 4 full blocks of 100, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40, and the last partial block (480-488) contributes 9 more, so 49. So, 49+49=98 8's.\n\nNow, total 4's were 187, and 8's were 98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's there. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, 488/10=48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, and the last 8 numbers (481-488) don't include a 4 in the units place, so 48. So, total 4's: 48+50+89=187. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last number 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49+49=98. So, 98 8's.\n\nThus, 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I thought 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, maybe I should check if I included all the 8's correctly.\n\nWait, in the units place, 488 is page 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 480-488: that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so that's correct.\n\nSo, yes, 98 8's.\n\nSo, 187-98=89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again: 187-98=89. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. Let me recount.\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges:\n\n40-49: 10 numbers,\n\n140-149:10,\n\n240-249:10,\n\n340-349:10,\n\n440-449:10.\n\nThat's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, which is 4 full blocks and a partial one, giving 49.\n\nSo, the counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 89.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't double-count any numbers or miss any ranges.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately by digit positions.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full times, and in the last partial set (481-488), 4 doesn't appear in the units place, so 48.\n\n- Tens place: For each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. 488 /100=4.88, so 4 full times, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, total tens place: 40+10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full times, each contributing one 8, and in the last partial set (481-488), 488 has an 8, so 49.\n\n- Tens place: 488 /100=4.88, so 4 full blocks, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place: 40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 187-98=89.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers will be from 1 to 99 (two digits), 100 to 488 (three digits). Wait, actually, 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit. So, I should probably break this down into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's and 8's in each of these categories.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. In this range, the digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. So, the digit 4 appears once (page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, in single-digit pages, 4's and 8's each occur once. So, the count for 4 is 1, and for 8 is 1. The difference here is 0.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. Here, each page number is from 10 to 99, so two digits. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place and the units place.\n\nLet's start with the tens place. The tens digit can be from 1 to 9. For each tens digit, the units digit ranges from 0 to 9. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place when the tens digit is 8 (80 to 89).\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens digit (1-9), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, since there are 9 tens digits (1-9), 4 appears 9 times in the units place. Similarly, 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, total 4's in two-digit numbers: tens place (10) + units place (9) = 19. Similarly, total 8's in two-digit numbers: tens place (10) + units place (9) = 19. So, again, the difference is 0 in two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but hold on, is that correct? Let me double-check. For the units place, each tens digit from 1 to 9 includes a 4 and an 8 in the units place. So, for each of the 9 tens digits, 4 appears once, so 9 times. Similarly for 8. So yes, that seems right. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because we have three digits: hundreds, tens, and units. Let's break it down by each digit place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nLet's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. It's only in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and the hundreds digit is 1-4. Let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFor each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), the tens digit cycles from 0-9, and for each of these, the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, for each hundreds digit, 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundreds digit.\n\nBut wait, we have to be careful because the last set is 400-488, so when hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, let's adjust for that.\n\nFirst, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: each can have tens digits 0-9, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for each of these hundreds digits. So, 3 hundreds digits * 10 = 30 times for 4.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place for each of these hundreds digits, so 3*10=30 times for 8.\n\nNow, for the hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the tens digit can go from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for the tens digit 4, how many numbers? When tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 numbers. Similarly, for tens digit 8, the numbers would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nWait, let me clarify. For the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, for each tens digit, the units digit can be 0-9, except when the tens digit is 8, where units can only go up to 8.\n\nSo, for the tens digit 4 in 400-488: numbers are 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nFor the tens digit 8 in hundreds digit 4: numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total for the tens place:\n\n4's: 30 (from hundreds digits 1,2,3) + 10 (from hundreds digit 4) = 40.\n\n8's: 30 (from hundreds digits 1,2,3) + 9 (from hundreds digit 4) = 39.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when hundreds digits are 1,2,3, for each, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). So, 3*10=30 for 4's. Similarly, 3*10=30 for 8's in the tens place for hundreds digits 1,2,3.\n\nNow, for hundreds digit 4, tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449), and tens digit 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40. 8's in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit can be 0-9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundreds digit (1-4), and each tens digit (0-9), the units digit cycles through 0-9.\n\nLet's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\nFor each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), and for each tens digit (0-9), the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, for each hundreds digit, there are 10 tens digits, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place. So, per hundreds digit, 10 times for 4. Since there are 4 hundreds digits, that's 4*10=40 times for 4.\n\nWait, but hold on, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8, as we saw earlier. So, when hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 0-8, not 0-9. So, for hundreds digit 4, the number of tens digits is 9 (0-8), not 10. So, the units digit 4 would appear 9 times for hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, let me clarify. For each hundreds digit, the number of tens digits is as follows:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: tens digits 0-9, so 10 each.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: tens digits 0-8, so 9.\n\nTherefore, for units digit 4:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10 tens digits, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 in units place. So, 3*10=30.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 9 tens digits, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 in units place. So, 9.\n\nTotal units digit 4: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10 tens digits, each contributing 1 occurrence of 8 in units place. So, 3*10=30.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 9 tens digits, each contributing 1 occurrence of 8 in units place. So, 9.\n\nTotal units digit 8: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but wait a second, in the hundreds digit 4, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8. So, does that affect the count? Let me think. For units digit 8, in the hundreds digit 4, tens digit 8, the units digit 8 would be 488. But when we count the units digit 8, we're considering all numbers where the units digit is 8, regardless of the tens digit. So, for hundreds digit 4, tens digits 0-8, each can have units digit 8 once. So, that's 9 times (tens digits 0-8), each contributing a units digit 8. So, yes, 9 times. So, 30 + 9 = 39 for 8's in units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in units place, hundreds digit 4, tens digits 0-8, each can have units digit 4 once. So, 9 times. So, 30 + 9 = 39 for 4's in units place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place would be 40, but now it's 39. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, earlier I was counting units digit 4's in the three-digit numbers. So, for hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10 tens digits, so 10 numbers where units digit is 4. So, 3*10=30.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: tens digits 0-8, so 9 tens digits, each contributing a units digit 4 once. So, 9. So, total 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place: 3*10=30 for hundreds digits 1,2,3, and 9 for hundreds digit 4, totaling 39.\n\nSo, in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 39 times each.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place might be 40, but now it's 39. So, I need to correct that.\n\nSo, putting it all together for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nWait, that seems like a big difference. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488), which is correct.\n\nTens place: 4's are 40, 8's are 39.\n\nUnits place: both 39.\n\nSo, total 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nSo, the difference between 4's and 8's in three-digit numbers is 168 - 78 = 90.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits across single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n- 4's: 1\n\n- 8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- 4's: 19\n\n- 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- 4's: 168\n\n- 8's: 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier in three-digit numbers, I calculated 168 - 78 = 90, which is the same as the total difference. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts for three-digit numbers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10 occurrences of 4 in tens place, so 3*10=30.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in tens place:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10 occurrences of 8 in tens place, so 3*10=30.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10 occurrences of 4 in units place, so 3*10=30.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: tens digits 0-8, so 9 occurrences of 4 in units place.\n\nTotal 4's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10 occurrences, so 30.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: tens digits 0-8, so 9 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nTotal 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nNow, adding in the single and two-digit numbers:\n\nTotal 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me see if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the three-digit numbers. Let me try another approach.\n\nAnother way is to consider each digit place separately across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet's think about each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often, except possibly for the last page if it doesn't complete the cycle.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each full group of 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for units digit 4: 48 times.\n\nFor the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484).\n\nSo, total units digit 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8's: in each full group, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 for three-digit units digit 4's and 39 for 8's. But now, this approach is giving me 49 each. That's a discrepancy. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me reconcile this.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, I was only considering 100-488, but when counting units digits across all numbers, it's from 1-488.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count all page numbers, not just three-digit ones.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I broke it down into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, which should cover all numbers. But this new approach is giving me different counts, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's try this units digit approach again.\n\nTotal numbers: 1-488.\n\nEach units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for units digit 4, how many times does it appear?\n\nNumber of complete decades: 488 // 10 = 48, with remainder 8.\n\nIn each decade, units digit 4 appears once. So, 48 times.\n\nIn the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484).\n\nTotal units digit 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8's: 48 times in complete decades, plus once in the remaining 8 numbers (488). So, 49.\n\nSo, units digit 4's: 49.\n\nUnits digit 8's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, let's count tens digits.\n\nTens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (1-100, 101-200, ..., 401-488).\n\nWait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times each tens digit appears.\n\nEach tens digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for each hundred, 10 times per tens digit.\n\nTotal hundreds: 4 (1-400). So, 4*10=40 times for each tens digit.\n\nBut wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens digit in 400-488 goes from 0-8, each appearing 9 times (since 89 / 10 = 8 full tens with 9 remaining).\n\nWait, no, let me think again.\n\nFrom 1-400, each tens digit 0-9 appears exactly 40 times (4 hundreds * 10 times each).\n\nNow, from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, the tens digits go from 0-8.\n\nFor each tens digit 0-8, how many times do they appear?\n\nEach tens digit from 0-8 appears 9 times in 401-488.\n\nBecause 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8 full tens (0-7) and 8 numbers (80-88). Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, 401-488 can be broken down as:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers.\n\n- 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers.\n\n...\n\n- 481-490: but since we only go up to 488, this is 8 numbers (481-488).\n\nSo, for tens digits 0-8:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times (e.g., 401-410, 411-420, ..., 471-480).\n\n- Tens digit 8: appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let's see:\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 numbers.\n\n- From 401-410: 10 numbers, tens digit 0.\n\n- 411-420: 10, tens digit 1.\n\n...\n\n- 481-490: but since we stop at 488, this is 8 numbers: 481-488, tens digit 8.\n\nSo, for tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times.\n\nTens digit 8: appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total for tens digits in 401-488:\n\n- 0-7: 10 each.\n\n- 8: 8.\n\nSo, now, total tens digits:\n\n- From 1-400: each tens digit 0-9 appears 40 times.\n\n- From 401-488:\n\n  - Tens digits 0-7: 10 each.\n\n  - Tens digit 8: 8.\n\nSo, total tens digits:\n\n- For 4's tens digit: in 1-400, 40 times. In 401-488, tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450). So, total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- For 8's tens digit: in 1-400, 40 times. In 401-488, tens digit 8 appears 8 times. So, total 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in three-digit numbers, 4's in tens place were 40 and 8's were 39. But now, using this approach, 4's in tens place are 50 and 8's are 48.\n\nHmm, this is conflicting with my earlier count. I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me try to clarify.\n\nWhen I broke it down into single, two, and three-digit numbers, I considered three-digit numbers from 100-488. But perhaps I should consider all numbers from 1-488 and count each digit place separately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the issue is that in the initial approach, I considered three-digit numbers starting at 100, but the tens and units digits for numbers 1-99 are also part of the total count.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because I'm mixing different methods. Let me try a different approach: count each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately across all numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with units digit:\n\nAs calculated earlier, units digit 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nTens digit:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nEach tens digit from 0-9 appears equally in each hundred.\n\nFor each hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), each tens digit 0-9 appears 10 times.\n\nThere are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), so each tens digit appears 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, the tens digits go from 0-8, as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers.\n\n- 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers.\n\n...\n\n- 481-490: but since we stop at 488, this is 8 numbers, tens digit 8.\n\nSo, in 401-488:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times.\n\n- Tens digit 8: appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total for tens digits:\n\n- For each digit 0-7: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\n- For digit 8: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n- For digits 9: only in 1-400, 40 times, as 401-488 don't have tens digit 9.\n\nWait, but 401-488 doesn't include any numbers with tens digit 9, since 490 would be beyond 488.\n\nSo, for tens digit 9: only in 1-400, 40 times.\n\nSo, in total:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 50 times.\n\n- Tens digit 8: 48 times.\n\nSimilarly, hundreds digit:\n\nFrom 1-488, hundreds digits are 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488).\n\nSo, hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nHundreds digits 1,2,3: each appear 100 times (100-199, etc.).\n\nSo, hundreds digit 4: 89 times.\n\nHundreds digits 1,2,3: 100 each.\n\nSo, hundreds digit 4: 89 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all digit places.\n\nUnits digit:\n\n- 4: 49\n\n- 8: 49\n\nTens digit:\n\n- 4: 50\n\n- 8: 48\n\nHundreds digit:\n\n- 4: 89\n\n- 8: 0 (since hundreds digits are 0,1,2,3,4; 8 never appears)\n\nSo, total 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n\n- Tens: 50\n\n- Hundreds: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n\n- Tens: 48\n\n- Hundreds: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 98 for 8's. Hmm, discrepancy here.\n\nWait, let's check the units digit again. From 1-488, units digit 8 appears how many times?\n\nEach complete decade (1-10, 11-20, etc.) has one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete decades in 480, and then 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so one more 8 (488). So, 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 4: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens digit 8: in 1-400, 40 times. In 401-488, 8 times. So, 40+8=48.\n\nHundreds digit 8: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) +0=97.\n\nBut earlier, when I broke it down into single, two, and three-digit numbers, I had 98 for 8's. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recount the single and two-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n- 4:1\n\n- 8:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- 4's: 19\n\n- 8's:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- 4's:168\n\n- 8's:78\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nBut according to the digit place approach, total 8's are 97.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy of 1. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps in the digit place approach, I missed something.\n\nWait, let's recount the units digit for 8's. From 1-488, units digit 8 occurs at 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nHow many numbers is that?\n\nThe first occurrence is 8, last is 488.\n\nThe sequence is 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with a=8, d=10.\n\nNumber of terms: Let's solve 8 + (n-1)*10 =488.\n\nSo, (n-1)*10=480.\n\nn-1=48.\n\nn=49.\n\nSo, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 4: same approach.\n\nFirst term 4, last term 484.\n\n4 + (n-1)*10=484.\n\n(n-1)*10=480.\n\nn=49.\n\nSo, 49 times.\n\nSo, units digits are correct.\n\nTens digits:\n\nFrom 1-488, tens digit 8 occurs how many times?\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nFrom 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488: tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 numbers. Wait, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, tens digit 8 occurs 9 times in 401-488.\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's: 40 (from 1-400) +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times. That was a mistake.\n\nSo, correcting that, tens digit 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 4's: in 1-400, 40 times. In 401-488, tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's:50.\n\nTens digit 8's:49.\n\nHundreds digit 4's:89.\n\nHundreds digit 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nAh, so earlier, I had mistakenly counted tens digit 8's as 48, but it's actually 49. So, total 8's are 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier in the three-digit approach, I had 78 for 8's in three-digit numbers, but when considering all numbers, it's 98. So, I must have made a mistake in the three-digit approach by not considering that the two-digit numbers also contribute to the 8's count.\n\nWait, no, in the three-digit approach, I included single and two-digit numbers separately, which correctly accounted for all 8's. So, the discrepancy was in the tens digit count when I considered all numbers. I had initially thought tens digit 8's were 48, but it's actually 49.\n\nSo, the correct total 8's are 98, and 4's are 188, so the difference is 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) across all page numbers, we find that the digit 4 appears 188 times, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference between the counts is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So from page 1 to page 488, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. \n\nFirst, I think I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So in every 10 pages, each digit appears once in the units place. For example, pages 1-10 have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 (units digits). So the digit 4 appears once in the units place every 10 pages, and the same for 8.\n\nBut wait, the book has 488 pages, which is not a multiple of 10. So I need to handle the last partial block separately. Let me see: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So there are 48 full blocks of 10 pages and then 8 additional pages (481-488).\n\nIn each full block of 10, the units digit 4 appears once, and so does the units digit 8. So for 48 blocks, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's.\n\nNow, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So here, the units digit 4 appears once (page 484) and the units digit 8 appears once (page 488). So that adds 1 more 4 and 1 more 8 in the units place.\n\nSo total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal so far.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each block of 100 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each.\n\nSo for the tens digit, each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages. So for the digit 4, in the tens place, it appears 10 times in each 100 pages, and the same for 8.\n\nBut again, the total number of pages is 488, which is less than 500. So how many full hundreds do we have? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nWait, actually, 488 pages mean that we have 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 pages from 401-488. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 1-100 is the first hundred, 101-200 the second, 201-300 the third, 301-400 the fourth, and then 401-488 is the remaining 88 pages. So up to page 488, we have 4 full hundreds and a partial hundred.\n\nWait, but the tens digit in the partial hundred (401-488) is from 0 to 8 in the tens place, right? Because 488 is the last page. So let me check: from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490). But wait, 488 is the last page, so the tens digit goes up to 8, but only up to 488. So how many times does each digit appear in the tens place in 401-488?\n\nWait, let me think again. The tens digit for 401-488: from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; 421-430, it's 2; 431-440, it's 3; 441-450, it's 4; 451-460, it's 5; 461-470, it's 6; 471-480, it's 7; 481-488, it's 8.\n\nEach of these blocks has 10 pages except the last one, which has 8 pages (481-488). So for the tens digit:\n\n- 0 appears 10 times (401-410)\n- 1 appears 10 times (411-420)\n- 2 appears 10 times (421-430)\n- 3 appears 10 times (431-440)\n- 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- 5 appears 10 times (451-460)\n- 6 appears 10 times (461-470)\n- 7 appears 10 times (471-480)\n- 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nWait, but that's not correct because 481-488 is only 8 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 10. So in the partial hundred, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 8 times, while digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but in our case, we're looking for the digit 4 and 8 in the tens place. So for the digit 4 in the tens place, in the partial hundred (401-488), how many times does it appear? From 441-450, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages. So that's 10 times. So in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the partial hundred.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, it appears 8 times in the partial hundred.\n\nNow, for the full hundreds (1-400), each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So 4 full hundreds would have 4*10 = 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place and 4*10 = 40 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nThen, in the partial hundred (401-488), as we saw, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nSo so far, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's: 48. So 4's are ahead by 2 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488.\n\nWait, no. Wait, pages 1-99 have no hundreds digit, right? Or the hundreds digit is 0. Wait, but in page numbers, 1-99 are two-digit numbers, so the hundreds digit is 0, but maybe we don't count leading zeros. So perhaps the hundreds digit is only present when the page number is three digits, i.e., from 100 onwards.\n\nWait, but in page numbers, 100 is the first page with a hundreds digit, which is 1. Then 200-299 have hundreds digit 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo the hundreds digit is:\n\n- 1: 100-199 (100 pages)\n- 2: 200-299 (100 pages)\n- 3: 300-399 (100 pages)\n- 4: 400-488 (89 pages, since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n\nWait, 400 to 488 is 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nSo the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place (from 400-488).\n\nSimilarly, hundreds digits 1, 2, 3 each appear 100 times.\n\nSo for the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 appears 0 times, because the hundreds digits go up to 4. There's no page with hundreds digit 8 in a 488-page book.\n\nWait, that's correct because 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds digits only go up to 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo now, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is actually 188? Wait, 99 + 80 is 179, plus 9 is 188. Yes, correct.\n\nNow for the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So 49 units, 48 tens, 0 hundreds.\n\nSo now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full blocks (48*10=480) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n- In each full block, 1 four and 1 eight in units place: 48 each.\n- In the extra 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- So units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 + 1 = 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each full hundred (100 pages) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10 = 40 fours and 40 eights in the tens place from full hundreds.\n- Then, the partial hundred is 401-488, which is 88 pages.\n- In the tens place, for 401-488:\n  - From 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n  - 411-420: 1 (10)\n  - 421-430: 2 (10)\n  - 431-440: 3 (10)\n  - 441-450: 4 (10)\n  - 451-460: 5 (10)\n  - 461-470: 6 (10)\n  - 471-480: 7 (10)\n  - 481-488: 8 (8 pages)\n- So in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488).\n- So in the tens place, 4's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n- That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Pages 1-99: no hundreds digit, so 0.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit 1 (100 times)\n- 200-299: 2 (100)\n- 300-399: 3 (100)\n- 400-488: 4 (89 times)\n- So 4 appears 89 times in hundreds place, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me check if I missed anything.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe I should calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different counting method to verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet me try that again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's: For each 10 pages, there's one 4 in the units place. So total number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10) + (if the last partial block has a 4, add 1). Wait, floor(488/10) is 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4, so no extra 4 in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought there was a 4 in the units place in the last partial block. Wait, maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, pages 481-488: units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 484 is page 484, which is in the last partial block. So that's one 4 in the units place. So the correct count is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nAs before, each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, with 481-488 having 8 as the tens digit for 8 pages.\n\nSo for 4's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times (from 400-488), and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with hundreds digit 4. So 89 times. Correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in 401-488, the digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. And 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages. So that's correct.\n\nUnits place in 481-488: 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488). So that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I first thought about the units place, I considered that 488 mod 10 is 8, so the last partial block is 8 pages, which includes a 4 and an 8 in the units place. So that's correct.\n\nSo I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n### Units Place\n- Each block of 10 pages contains one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- There are 48 full blocks of 10 pages, contributing 48 occurrences of each digit.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- Total 4's in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n- Total 8's in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n\n### Tens Place\n- Each block of 100 pages contains 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), contributing \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\) occurrences of each digit.\n- The remaining 88 pages (401-488) include:\n  - 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (441-450).\n  - 8 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (481-488).\n- Total 4's in tens place: \\(40 + 10 = 50\\)\n- Total 8's in tens place: \\(40 + 8 = 48\\)\n\n### Hundreds Place\n- The hundreds digit 4 appears in pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n- The hundreds digit 8 does not appear in any page number within 488.\n- Total 4's in hundreds place: 89\n- Total 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\n### Total Counts\n- Total 4's: \\(49 \\text{ (units)} + 50 \\text{ (tens)} + 89 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 188\\)\n- Total 8's: \\(49 \\text{ (units)} + 48 \\text{ (tens)} + 0 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 97\\)\n\n### Difference\n- The number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by \\(188 - 97 = 91\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{91}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider how often the digits 4 and 8 appear in each position of the page numbers. Since each page number is printed once, I can look at the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For every 10 consecutive pages, the digits 0 through 9 each appear once in the units place. So, for the digit 4, it appears once every 10 pages, right? Similarly, the digit 8 appears once every 10 pages. So, if I can figure out how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages, I can find the number of 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times for each set of 10, and then in the extra 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place again. So, units place 4's: 48 times. Similarly, 8's in the units place: 48 times as well, plus one more in the extra pages because page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me check that again. Each set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 complete sets would give 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1 through 8, so 8 appears once more (page 488). So, units place 8's total to 48 + 1 = 49, while 4's remain at 48. So, in the units place, 8's are more by 1.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. For units digits, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? It's the number of times 4 is the last digit. So, every 10 pages, once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times, plus if the last digit is 4 or not. Since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 in the units place is at page 484, so yes, 48 times. Similarly, 8's in the units place: every 10 pages, once, so 48 times, plus one more at 488, so 49 times. So, units place: 4's = 48, 8's = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each block of 100 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place for pages 80-89.\n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of the 4 complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4*10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles again. Let's see: from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, so 440-449 is within that range. So, that's another 10 times for 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 8 in the tens place is from 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 pages (480-488), so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 401-488 is 88 pages. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 times. For the tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 = 50 times.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 (from the four hundreds) + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because in the four hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, 440-449 adds 10 4's, and 480-488 adds 9 8's. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 49, so 4's are more by 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no: pages 1-99 have no hundreds digit (they are two-digit numbers), but when considering three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit starts at 1 for 100. So, let's correct that.\n\nWait, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From page 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\n8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- 4's: 48 times (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and the last 8 pages don't include another 4 in units place)\n- 8's: 49 times (48 full tens, plus one more at 488)\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10 = 40 each.\n- Then, in 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 4's, and 480-488 adds 9 8's.\n- So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place in the last partial hundred. Let me verify that again.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, it's 10 pages except for the last one, which is only 9 pages (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 187, and 8's are 98, so 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit high. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for each hundred, 10 times each digit appears, so 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4*10=40 for 4's, and same for 8's. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 more 4's, and 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 more 8's. So, 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's:40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire range 1-488 and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each digit.\n\nWait, another approach: for each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the remainder is >=4, add 1. But 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49? Wait, no, because the units digit cycles every 10. Wait, no, actually, the number of times 4 appears in units place is floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10)=48. So, 48 times. Similarly, for 8's, it's the same: floor(489/10)=48, plus if the last digit is >=8, which it is (8), so 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier count where I thought 4's were 48 and 8's were 49 in units place. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, so maybe my initial approach was wrong. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, actually, the formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to n is:\n\nnumber = n // 10 * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 1)\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as:\n\nFor units digit, the number of times digit d appears from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = n // 10\nif d <= (n % 10):\n    count += 1\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\nn=488, n//10=48, n%10=8. Since 4 <=8, count=48+1=49.\n\nWait, but that would mean 4 appears 49 times in the units place, which contradicts my earlier thought where I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me take a smaller example. Let's say n=14.\n\nFrom 1 to 14, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4.\n\nSo, digit 4 appears twice in the units place: at 4 and 14.\n\nUsing the formula: n=14, d=4.\n\ncount = 14//10=1, since 4<=4 (14%10=4), count +=1, so total 2. Which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8, n=14: 14//10=1, since 8<=4? No, 8>4, so count remains 1. But in reality, from 1-14, 8 appears once in the units place (at 8). So, the formula gives 1, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in our case, n=488, d=4.\n\nn//10=48, n%10=8. Since 4<=8, count=48+1=49. So, 4 appears 49 times in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8, n=488:\n\nn//10=48, n%10=8. Since 8<=8, count=48+1=49. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. Wait, that's different from my initial thought.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 4's in units place were 48 and 8's were 49, but according to this formula, both are 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's test this with n=488.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480), each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more (484), and 8 appears once more (488). So, total 4's in units place: 48 +1=49, and 8's:48 +1=49. So, both are 49. So, my initial thought was wrong; I must have miscounted earlier.\n\nSo, units place: 4's=49, 8's=49.\n\nNow, moving on to tens place.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10\nremainder = n % 100\nif d < (remainder // 10):\n    count += 10\nelif d == (remainder // 10):\n    count += (remainder % 10) + 1\nelse:\n    count += 0\n\nWait, let me test this with an example. Let's take n=488, d=4.\n\nn//100=4, so count=4*10=40.\n\nremainder=488%100=88.\n\nremainder//10=8.\n\nSince 4 <8, count +=10, so total=50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nn//100=4, count=4*10=40.\n\nremainder=88.\n\nremainder//10=8.\n\nSince d=8 ==8, count += (88%10)+1=8+1=9. So, total=40+9=49.\n\nWait, so for tens place:\n\n4's:50, 8's:49.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, for d=4 in tens place up to 488, it's 50 times, and for d=8, it's 49 times.\n\nWait, but let's check with smaller numbers to make sure.\n\nTake n=48, d=4.\n\nn//100=0, so count=0.\n\nremainder=48.\n\nremainder//10=4.\n\nSince d=4 ==4, count += (48%10)+1=8+1=9. So, total=9.\n\nBut from 1-48, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 pages, but 49 is beyond 48, so only 40-48, which is 9 pages. So, count=9, which matches the formula.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place up to 48:\n\nn=48, d=8.\n\nn//100=0, count=0.\n\nremainder=48.\n\nremainder//10=4.\n\nSince 8>4, count +=0. So, total=0. Which is correct because 80-89 are beyond 48.\n\nSo, the formula seems to work.\n\nTherefore, applying it to n=488:\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:50, 8's:49.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier total of 89. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the units place, I initially thought 4's were 48 and 8's 49, but using the formula, both are 49. Then, in the tens place, 4's=50, 8's=49, and hundreds place 4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 89. So, which one is correct?\n\nLet me recount:\n\nUnits place:\n\nUsing the formula, 4's=49, 8's=49.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's=50, 8's=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but when I first thought of the units place, I thought 4's were 48 and 8's 49, leading to a difference of 89. But using the formula, both are 49, leading to a difference of 90.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nEvery 10 pages, once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So, total 48+1=49 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears once every 10 pages, 48 times, plus once more at 488, so 49 times.\n\nSo, units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nThen, tens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 times for 4's and 4*10=40 times for 8's.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, 440-449 is 10 pages with 4 in the tens place, and 480-488 is 9 pages with 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:40+10=50.\n\n8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but that was because I miscalculated the units place as 48 for 4's and 49 for 8's, which was incorrect. Actually, both are 49 in the units place.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I should use another method to verify.\n\nAnother approach: count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately.\n\nUnits digit:\n\nAs established, 49 each.\n\nTens digit:\n\n4's:50, 8's:49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\n4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place were 48, leading to a difference of 89, but that was a mistake. The correct count is 49 for both 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **Digit '4':** Appears once every 10 pages. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 pages, contributing 48 '4's. The last 8 pages (481-488) include another '4' at 484, totaling 49 '4's.\n   - **Digit '8':** Similarly, appears once every 10 pages, contributing 48 '8's. The last page, 488, adds another '8', totaling 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **Digit '4':** Each hundred contributes 10 '4's in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), contributing 40 '4's. The range 401-488 includes another 10 '4's (440-449), totaling 50 '4's.\n   - **Digit '8':** Similarly, each hundred contributes 10 '8's, totaling 40 from the first four hundreds. The range 401-488 adds 9 '8's (480-488), totaling 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **Digit '4':** Appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, contributing 89 '4's.\n   - **Digit '8':** Does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' appears 90 times more than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 separately. \n\nFirst, I know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, each page is labeled with a number, and each of these numbers can be one, two, or three digits long. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. That way, I can systematically count the occurrences without missing any or double-counting. \n\nLet's start by considering each position one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - How many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the full blocks. Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - How many such blocks are there? Since 488 is less than 500, there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and a partial block from 400-488.\n   - In each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 full hundreds contribute 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n   - Now, in the partial block 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, etc., up to 8 for 480-488. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 occurrences.\n   - So, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from full blocks) + 10 (from partial block) = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. The digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs from 400 to 488.\n   - How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n   - Wait, but the problem is about page numbers, and the hundreds digit is only present when the page number is three digits. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so we don't count anything there. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nHmm, wait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the counts again for each place.\n\nWait, for the units place, 488 pages. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is how many times 4 appears in 1-488 in the units digit.\n\nEach 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, and then in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers, so for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, as I thought, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48.\n   - In the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n   - Now, in the partial block 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Let's see, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so that's 9 numbers. But wait, actually, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial block.\n   - So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from full blocks) + 9 (from partial block) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 488 is less than 800, so the hundreds digit is only 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, adding up all the 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check again.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus one more in 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4*10=40, plus in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me think again.\n\nIn the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, 4 hundreds, 10 each, so 40.\n\nIn the partial block 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 numbers, once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times in full tens, and then in the last partial ten (481-488), 484 is the only one, so 1 more, total 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, same logic: 48 full tens, 48, plus 488, so 1 more, total 49.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me see: from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 4's in the tens place again. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds, 10 each, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 numbers. So, 50 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nAnd 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 4's in the hundreds place are 89, which seems like a lot. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Correct.\n\nSo, 89 in hundreds place, 50 in tens, 49 in units, total 188.\n\nFor 8's, only up to 488, so in hundreds place, 0.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me see: in the partial block 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times the tens digit is 8. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, 40 from the full hundreds, plus 9 from the partial block, total 49 in tens place for 8's.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTotal 8's: 98.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcounting the hundreds place for 4's. Because, for example, the number 400 is counted once, 401 once, etc., up to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is: how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 hundreds, 10 each, 40, plus 10 in 440-449, so 50.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make off-by-one errors.\n\nWait, for the units place, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digits go from 1-8, so 484 is the only one with a 4, so 1 more, total 49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 40+10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus 488, so 1 more, total 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4*10=40. In 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me think again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nWait, but when I count the hundreds place, I'm only considering the hundreds digit, so each of these 89 numbers contributes exactly one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, in the partial block, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for 8's again. In 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488. So, 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times the tens digit is 8.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full blocks (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every block of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (400 numbers) and a partial block (400-488).\n   - Total: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every block of 10 numbers, 8 appears once. There are 48 full blocks and the last number 488.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every block of 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds and a partial block (400-488).\n   - In the partial block, 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n   - Total: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the numbers range from 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), and three-digit (100-488).\n\nI think I can separate the counting based on the number of digits. Let's handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times. But wait, the last group might not be complete. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 49 groups where the units digit cycles through 0-9. Wait, no, that might not be right. Because when you have 488, the units digit goes up to 8, so the last group is 480-488, which is a full group of 9 numbers, but since 488 is the end, the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, actually, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (from 1-480), each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which is 48 full groups and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times 1 (from each group) plus 1 more from the last partial group (484), so 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Similarly, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in every block of 100 numbers, 10 times. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Then, this repeats every 100 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nFrom 1-488, we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 400-499 would be the next hundred, but we only go up to 488. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, but that's a separate consideration. Let's focus on the tens place first.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, from 1-100, it's 40-49 (10 numbers). From 101-200, it's 140-149 (another 10). Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349. So, that's 4 sets of 10, totaling 40 times. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in that hundred? Wait, no. 401-488 is actually part of the 400-499 hundred, but we only go up to 488. So, in the tens place, 400-488 includes 400-488. The tens digit in this range would be 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. Therefore, total tens place 4's: 4 (from 1-300) *10 = 40, plus 10 from 400-488, totaling 50.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. From 1-100, 40-49: 10 numbers. 101-200: 140-149: 10. 201-300: 240-249: 10. 301-400: 340-349: 10. Then, 401-488: 440-449: 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is only 88 numbers, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, right? So yes, 10 numbers. So, total 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no. Actually, each number from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 +1 = 89 numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 50\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n1. **Units place**: For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more at 488.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 101-200: 180-189: 10.\n\nFrom 201-300: 280-289: 10.\n\nFrom 301-400: 380-389: 10.\n\nFrom 401-488: 480-488: How many numbers? 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 (from 1-300) *10 = 40, plus 9 from 401-488, totaling 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 1-100: 10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, and 401-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 49\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that: 49 + 49 is indeed 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 188\n\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times. That seems right.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4's, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, I had 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each, and the last partial hundred contributing 9, totaling 49. That seems right.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 4's, I had 5 sets, but let me count again:\n\nFrom 1-100: 40-49:10\n\n101-200:140-149:10\n\n201-300:240-249:10\n\n301-400:340-349:10\n\n401-488:440-449:10\n\nWait, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50. But 401-488 is only up to 488, but 440-449 is within that range, so yes, 10 numbers. So, 50 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 1-300, 4 sets of 10, and then 480-488:9, so 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. But each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. Correct.\n\nAnd for the units place, 4's: from 1-488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the last group from 481-488, which includes 484, so one more, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in the units place: same logic, 49.\n\nSo, yes, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10 and one partial group (481-488) with one more 4, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups and one partial group with one more 8, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks and one partial block (480-488) contributing 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, the page numbers range from 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), and three-digit (100-488).\n\nI think the best approach is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can cover all possibilities without missing any.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so I need to see how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then check the remainder.\n\n   Let's calculate how many complete tens are there in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete tens and 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, each complete ten contributes one 4. So, 48 times 1 is 48. Now, the last 8 numbers are 481 to 488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\n   How many complete hundreds are in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 is 40.\n\n   Now, the last 88 numbers are from 400 to 488. In the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, that's another 10 4's. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 more. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 400 to 488: 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nHmm, wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's correct, 89 times. But maybe I overcounted the tens place.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). Similarly, 101-200, 140-149, another 10, and so on up to 400-499. But since we're only going up to 488, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449). So, that's correct: 4 hundreds blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each contribute 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40, plus 10 more in 400-488, totaling 50. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, each 10 numbers contribute one 4, so 48 complete tens (since 488/10=48.8), so 48*1=48, and in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digits go up to 8, so no additional 4's. So, 48 units place 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, each block of 10 contributes one 8. So, 48 complete tens, each contributing one 8, so 48.\n\n   Now, the last 8 numbers are 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 8 appears once in the units place (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** For each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\n   How many complete hundreds? 4. So, 4*10=40.\n\n   Now, in the last 88 numbers (400-488), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9.\n\n   So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 480-488.\n\n   So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me verify that again. For the tens place, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, yes, 40 from the first 400 pages and 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, no, units place is 49 and tens place is 49, so total is 98.\n\nWait, but wait, in the units place, from 1-488, how many 8's are there?\n\nEach 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place, so 48 times 1 is 48, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 8's, so 4 hundreds give 40, and then in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears for 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 more, totaling 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, earlier I thought total 4's were 187, but let me recount:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm counting correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me think again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 4's, I had 50. Let me check that again. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 40, plus in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449), so 10 more, totaling 50. That seems right.\n\nIn the units place, 48 4's. So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98 total.\n\nThus, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 89 seems like a big difference. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternative approach: Count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately, but maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me count the number of 4's in each digit place:\n\n- Units place: For each 10 numbers, one 4. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so no 4. So, units: 48.\n\n- Tens place: For each 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100, there are 10 4's in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, 10 more. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: Each 10 numbers, one 8. So, 48 full tens, 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each 100 numbers, 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds: 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers: 480-488. So, 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: None, since the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should list out some pages and see.\n\nFor example, in the units place, 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484. That's 48 times, as 488/10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets.\n\nIn the tens place, 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block of 100 has 10, so 4 blocks give 40, plus 10 more in 440-449, totaling 50.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488. Each 10 numbers, so 48 full sets give 48, plus 488 is the 49th, so 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. Each 100 has 10, so 4*10=40, plus in 480-488, it's 9 numbers, so 9. Total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:187, 8's:98, difference 89.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider how often the digits 4 and 8 appear in each position of the page numbers. Since page numbers go from 1 to 488, I can think about the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately. \n\nFirst, I'll tackle the units place. For every group of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once, and the digit 8 also appears exactly once. Now, how many such groups are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 full groups of ten, and then a partial group from 481 to 488. \n\nIn each full group, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 full groups, that's 48 times each for both digits. Then, in the partial group from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484), and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, so far, they're equal in the units place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89). \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 ones. So, from 1-400, there are 4 full hundreds. In each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place in each hundred, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nBut wait, after 400, we have pages 401-488. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, does 4 appear in the tens place here? Let's see: 401-410 have tens digit 0, 411-420 have 1, ..., 440-449 have 4, and 480-488 have 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is included but 489 isn't part of the book). Wait, no, 480-488 is actually 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nWait, but earlier, from 1-400, we had 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total in the tens place: 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears one more time than 8.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be where 8 appears in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total appearances of 4 and 8 in each digit place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 = 90, which seems like a lot. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me check the units place again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? For each ten numbers, 4 appears once, so 48 full tens (1-480) give 48 times, and then 481-488 includes 484, so that's one more, making 49. Similarly, 8 appears 49 times. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-400, 4 appears 40 times (4 per hundred times 4 hundreds). Then, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449). So, 40 + 10 = 50. For 8, in 1-400, 40 times, and in 401-488, 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49. So, 50 vs 49, correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That's correct because each of those pages has a 4 in the hundreds digit.\n\nIn the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, ..., 8 for 480-488. So, 440-449 is the only time 4 appears in the tens place beyond the 400s, which is 10 times. So, 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place, from 1-400, it's 40 times, and from 401-488, it's 9 times, so 49.\n\nIn the units place, both are 49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the hundreds place again. From 1-488, the hundreds digit is only 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of times 8 appears in the hundreds place, which is zero, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 pages.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 400 to 488 is 89 pages because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, 50 times in the tens, and 49 in the units, totaling 188.\n\n8 appears 49 times in the units, 49 in the tens, and 0 in the hundreds, totaling 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, which it is (488 ends with 8, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, and then in the last partial ten, 481-488, 4 appears once at 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears 48 times in the units place from 1-480, and once at 488, so 49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place: For each hundred, 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50.\n\nSimilarly, 8 in the tens place: From 1-400, 4 sets of 100, each with 80-89, so 4*10=40. From 401-488, 8 in the tens place is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\n4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big number, but considering that 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times, which is a significant contribution. So, maybe that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about each digit place separately and sum them up.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nUnits digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the units digit of 488 is >=4, which it is (8 >=4), so add 1. So, 49.\n\nNumber of 8's: Similarly, floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the units digit >=8, which it is (8=8), so add 1. So, 49.\n\nTens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100) = 4 (since 488/100=4.88), so 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, total 40 +10=50.\n\nNumber of 8's: Similarly, floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since 488 is less than 1000, we have to check if the hundreds digit is 4. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nNumber of 8's: Hundreds digit is 8 would be from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze the frequency of the digits 4 and 8 in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups (1-480) and a partial group (481-488).\n   - 4 appears once in each group: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - 8 appears once in each group: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in every 100 numbers.\n   - From 1-400: 4 appears 40 times (4 sets of 10), and 8 appears 40 times.\n   - From 401-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSumming up:\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** 90 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I'll have to check each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place one by one.\n\n1. **Units place (the first digit from the right):** For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on.\n\n   Now, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete group, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial group from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (the second digit from the right):** Similarly, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every group of 100 numbers. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in pages 40-49, which is 10 times. \n\n   Now, how many complete groups of 100 are there in 488? That's 4 complete groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial group from 401-488.\n\n   In each complete group of 100, the tens digit is 4 ten times, so 4 groups would give 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial group from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Specifically, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 410-420 is 1, and so on. The tens digit is 4 in pages 440-449. That's 10 pages, but wait, our upper limit is 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's another 10 times. \n\n   Wait, but does 488 include 440-449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 10 more. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 (from the four complete groups) + 10 (from the partial group) = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (the third digit from the right):** Now, the hundreds digit. For numbers 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's there. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\n   So, how many times does the hundreds digit equal 4? That's from page 400 to page 488. The number of pages here is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 exactly 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place is 49, tens place is 50, and hundreds place is 89. So total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, in each group of 10, the digit 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, the partial group from 481-488: the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** For the tens digit, each group of 100 has the tens digit cycling through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each group of 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). \n\n   From 1-400, there are 4 complete groups of 100, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10 = 40 times. Then, the partial group from 401-488: the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-489). But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). Wait, but does that count as 9 or 10? Let me check: 480-489 is 10 pages, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 pages. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 (from complete groups) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. For the digit 8, the hundreds digit would be 8 in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units place is 49, tens place is 49, hundreds place is 0. So total 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. The difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's, in the units place, 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the 8 in 488, so 49. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 complete groups of 100, each contributing 10 8's, so 40, plus in the partial group from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times, so total 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 1-400, there are 4 complete groups of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the partial group 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in pages 440-449, which is 10 pages, but since 488 is less than 449? Wait, no, 449 is less than 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's another 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nWait, but 488 is beyond 449, so pages 440-449 are all included, so 10 pages, so yes, 10 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. So, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me just check the units place again. For 4's, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach group of 10 has one 4, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, the partial group is 481-488, which has 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once in this partial group (page 484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, same logic: 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the partial group 481-488 has 8, so 48 +1 =49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 complete groups of 10 (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8) give 48 fours, plus one in 484 \u2192 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 complete groups of 100 give 40 fours, plus 10 in 440-449 \u2192 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 pages (400-488) \u2192 89 fours.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 complete groups give 48 eights, plus one in 488 \u2192 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 complete groups give 40 eights, plus 9 in 480-488 \u2192 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 eights.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a three-digit number, right? From 1 to 488. So, page 1 is just '1', but as we go on, pages 10 to 99 are two digits, and from 100 onwards, they're three digits. Wait, but since 488 is a three-digit number, maybe I should consider all page numbers as three-digit by padding with leading zeros. That might make it easier to count the digits systematically. So, page 1 would be '001', page 10 would be '010', and so on up to '488'. \n\nNow, I need to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all page numbers and how many times '8' appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me think about each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits '4' and '8' and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once. So, for example, from 0 to 9, the digit '4' appears once in the units place, and so does '8'. But wait, our page numbers start at 1, so maybe I should adjust for that. Wait, no, if I include leading zeros, then page 1 is '001', so units digits from 0 to 9 would be considered in each block of 10. So, in each block of 10, '4' and '8' each appear once in the units place.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages (since 48*10 = 480, and 488 - 480 = 8). \n\nIn each complete block, '4' appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Similarly, '8' appears once, so 48 times. Now, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does '4' appear in the units place here? Yes, at 484. And '8' appears at 488. So, that's one more '4' and one more '8' in the units place. \n\nSo, total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So, they are equal here. Hmm, that's interesting. So, units place doesn't contribute to the difference.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. Similarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every block of 100 numbers. For example, from 00-09, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 each ten times. So, in the tens place, each digit appears 10 times per 100 numbers. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I consider the tens place, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for example, in 00-99, the tens digit is '0' for 00-09, '1' for 10-19, and so on up to '9' for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 040-049, 140-149, etc.), same for '8'. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 '4's and 40 '8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). Now, in the tens place, how many times does '4' and '8' appear?\n\nLooking at the tens digit, '4' appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, our range is up to 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place here. Similarly, '8' appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive), but wait, the tens digit is '8' for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is '8' for all of them. So, that's 9 times '8' in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, '8' appears 9 times in the partial hundred.\n\nSo, total '4's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial hundred) = 50.\n\nTotal '8's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from partial hundred) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, '4' appears 50 times, and '8' appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 1 more '4' than '8'.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is '0' for pages 1-99 (if we include leading zeros), '1' for 100-199, '2' for 200-299, '3' for 300-399, '4' for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does '4' appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about '8'? Well, '8' doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit can only be 0,1,2,3,4. So, '8' doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, '4' appears 89 times, and '8' appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 more '4's than '8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts from each place.\n\nFor '4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor '8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal '8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each 10 pages, '4' and '8' each appear once. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 '4' and 1 '8', so 48 each. Then the partial block from 481-488: units digits are 1-8. So, '4' appears once (484), '8' appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both '4' and '8'. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 pages, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 '4's and 40 '8's. Then, the partial hundred 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 to 8. '4' appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. '8' appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, '4's: 40 + 10 = 50; '8's: 40 + 9 = 49. So, the tens place gives '4' one more than '8'.\n\nHundreds place:\n- '4' appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. '8' doesn't appear in hundreds place. So, '4's: 89, '8's: 0.\n\nAdding up:\n'4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n'8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, when considering 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is '4', it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 '4's in the tens place. For '8's, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 '8's in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, when I count from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 '4's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nHmm, so the difference is 90. That seems correct. So, the number of '4's printed is 90 more than the number of '8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place. For the partial block 481-488, units digits are 1-8. So, '4' appears once at 484, and '8' appears once at 488. So, units place adds 1 to both counts, making it 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place: 40 +10=50 for '4's, 40 +9=49 for '8's. So, difference of 1 in tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 89 '4's, 0 '8's. So, difference of 89.\n\nTotal difference: 1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =90. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the units place when considering leading zeros. Because in reality, page 1 is just '1', not '001', so maybe the leading zeros aren't actually printed. So, does that affect the count? Hmm, that's a good point.\n\nWait, the problem says each page is printed one time, with the first page being 1 and the last 488. So, page numbers are printed as they are, without leading zeros. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, 100-488 are three-digit. So, maybe I overcounted the leading zeros, which aren't actually printed. So, I need to adjust my counts accordingly.\n\nOh, this changes things. So, I can't consider leading zeros because they aren't printed. So, I need to count only the actual digits that are printed.\n\nSo, let me start over without leading zeros.\n\nSo, page numbers from 1 to 488. Each page number is printed as is, without leading zeros. So, pages 1-9: single-digit, 10-99: two-digit, 100-488: three-digit.\n\nI need to count the number of '4's and '8's in each digit place, but considering the actual printed numbers.\n\nLet me structure this by considering the number of digits in each page number.\n\nFirst, pages 1-9: single-digit, so only units place.\n\nPages 10-99: two-digit, so tens and units places.\n\nPages 100-488: three-digit, so hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nI need to calculate the count of '4's and '8's in each place across all page numbers.\n\nLet me start with the units place.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor pages 1-9: units digits are 1-9. So, '4' appears once (page 4), '8' appears once (page 8).\n\nFor pages 10-99: each block of 10 pages (e.g., 10-19, 20-29, etc.) has one '4' and one '8' in the units place. There are 9 such blocks (10-19 up to 90-99). So, 9 '4's and 9 '8's.\n\nFor pages 100-488: each block of 10 pages will have one '4' and one '8' in the units place. How many blocks are there? From 100-488, that's 389 pages. 389 divided by 10 is 38.9, so 38 complete blocks and a partial block of 9 pages (481-488, since 38*10=380; 380+100=480, so 481-488 is 8 pages, not 9). Wait, 488-100+1=389 pages, so 389/10=38.9, so 38 complete blocks (each contributing 1 '4' and 1 '8') and a partial block of 9 pages (481-488). Wait, 38 blocks *10 pages=380 pages, so 100-480 is 380 pages, and then 481-488 is 8 pages.\n\nWait, so in the units place for pages 100-488:\n\n- 38 complete blocks: each contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8', so 38 '4's and 38 '8's.\n- Partial block 481-488: units digits are 1-8. So, '4' appears once (484), '8' appears once (488).\n\nSo, total units place '4's: 1 (from 1-9) + 9 (from 10-99) + 38 (from 100-480) +1 (from 481-488) = 1+9+38+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, units place '8's:1 (from 1-9) +9 (from 10-99)+38 (from 100-480)+1 (from 481-488)=49.\n\nSo, units place: '4's=49, '8's=49. No difference.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nPages 1-9: no tens digit, so '4's and '8's in tens place: 0.\n\nPages 10-99: two-digit numbers. The tens digit cycles from 1-9, each digit appearing 10 times (e.g., 10-19: tens digit '1', 20-29: '2', etc.). So, how many times does '4' and '8' appear in the tens place?\n\nIn pages 10-99, the tens digit is '4' for 40-49, which is 10 pages, so '4' appears 10 times. Similarly, '8' appears in 80-89, which is 10 pages, so '8' appears 10 times.\n\nPages 100-488: three-digit numbers. The tens digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred. Let's break this down:\n\nFrom 100-199: the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (140-149), '8' appears 10 times (180-189).\n\nSimilarly, from 200-299: '4' in tens place 10 times (240-249), '8' 10 times (280-289).\n\nFrom 300-399: same, '4' 10 times, '8' 10 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for '4' in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. For '8', it's 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the end). So, '4' appears 10 times, '8' appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total '4's in tens place from 100-488:\n\n- 100-199:10\n- 200-299:10\n- 300-399:10\n- 400-488:10\nTotal: 10+10+10+10=40.\n\nSimilarly, '8's in tens place:\n\n- 100-199:10\n- 200-299:10\n- 300-399:10\n- 400-488:9\nTotal:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total '4's in tens place: 10 (from 10-99) +40 (from 100-488)=50.\n\n'8's in tens place:10 (from 10-99)+39 (from 100-488)=49.\n\nSo, tens place: '4's=50, '8's=49. Difference of +1.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nPages 1-99: no hundreds digit, so '4's and '8's:0.\n\nPages 100-488: hundreds digit is '1', '2', '3', or '4'.\n\n'4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, '4' appears 89 times.\n\n'8' doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit goes up to '4'. So, '8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, hundreds place: '4's=89, '8's=0. Difference of +89.\n\nNow, let's sum up:\n\n'4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\n'8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the difference is 90. But wait, earlier I considered leading zeros and got the same result, but I was worried that leading zeros might affect the count. But now, without leading zeros, I still get the same difference of 90. So, maybe my initial approach was correct despite the leading zeros not being printed. Because in both cases, the counts for '4's and '8's in each place are the same as if leading zeros were considered. Wait, that's interesting.\n\nWait, let me think again. When I considered leading zeros, I included them in the count, but in reality, they aren't printed. So, does that mean that in the hundreds place, pages 1-99 would have hundreds digit '0', but since they aren't printed, the count for '0's in hundreds place is zero, which doesn't affect '4's and '8's. So, maybe the counts for '4's and '8's in each place are the same whether leading zeros are considered or not, because the actual printed digits are the same.\n\nWait, perhaps I was overcomplicating it. The counts for '4's and '8's in each digit place are the same whether leading zeros are considered or not, because leading zeros aren't actually printed, so they don't contribute to the counts. Therefore, the earlier calculation without considering leading zeros still gives the same result because the '4's and '8's are only in the places where the digits are actually printed.\n\nWait, but in my second approach, without leading zeros, I still ended up with the same total counts for '4's and '8's, leading to the same difference of 90. So, maybe the initial approach was correct, and the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For example, in the hundreds place, without leading zeros, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so '4's and '8's in hundreds place are only from 100-488, which is 89 '4's and 0 '8's. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, pages 1-9 don't have a tens digit, so '4's and '8's in tens place start from page 10. So, the count is 10 (from 10-99) plus 40 (from 100-488) for '4's, totaling 50, and 10 (from 10-99) plus 39 (from 100-488) for '8's, totaling 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place is correctly counted as 49 each.\n\nSo, the total '4's:188, '8's:98, difference:90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a 20-page book. Let's count '4's and '8's.\n\nPage numbers:1-20.\n\n'4's: page 4,14,24 (but 24 is beyond 20, so only 4 and 14. Wait, 20 is the last page, so up to 20.\n\nWait, pages 1-20:\n\n'4's:4,14. So, two '4's.\n\n'8's:8,18. Two '8's.\n\nDifference:0.\n\nWait, using my method:\n\nUnits place:\n\n1-9: '4' once, '8' once.\n\n10-19: units digits 0-9, so '4' once, '8' once.\n\nTotal units '4's:2, '8's:2.\n\nTens place:\n\n1-9: no tens digit.\n\n10-19: tens digit '1', so '4's and '8's:0.\n\nSo, tens place:0 each.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal '4's:2, '8's:2. Difference:0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 48-page book.\n\nPages 1-48.\n\n'4's:4,14,24,34,44.\n\n'8's:8,18,28,38,48.\n\nSo, '4's:5, '8's:5. Difference:0.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits place:\n\n1-9:1 each.\n\n10-48: units digits 0-9 for each ten.\n\nNumber of tens:4 (10-19,20-29,30-39,40-48). Wait, 40-48 is only 9 pages, so units digits 0-8.\n\nSo, units '4's: in 1-9:1. In 10-48: each ten block (10-19,20-29,30-39) contributes 1 '4', and in 40-48, units digits 0-8, so '4' at 44. So, total units '4's:1+3+1=5.\n\nSimilarly, units '8's:1 (from 1-9) +3 (from 10-39) +1 (from 40-48)=5.\n\nTens place:\n\n1-9:0.\n\n10-48: tens digits '1','2','3','4'.\n\nIn each ten block (10-19,20-29,30-39), '4' in tens place:0. '8' in tens place:0.\n\nIn 40-48: tens digit '4', so '4' appears 9 times (40-48). '8' doesn't appear in tens place here.\n\nSo, tens '4's:9, '8's:0.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal '4's: units (5) + tens (9)=14.\n\nWait, but in reality, '4's are 5. Wait, that's a discrepancy. So, my method is overcounting.\n\nWait, this suggests that my method isn't correct because in the 48-page example, the actual '4's are 5, but according to my method, it's 5 (units) +9 (tens)=14, which is way off.\n\nWait, this means that my approach is flawed. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the tens place for 40-48, the tens digit is '4' for all 9 pages (40-48). So, '4' appears 9 times in the tens place. But in reality, in the page numbers, the tens digit is '4' for 40-49, but since we only go up to 48, it's 9 times. So, in the tens place, '4' appears 9 times, but in the actual page numbers, '4' in the tens place is 40-48, which is 9 pages, so 9 '4's. But in reality, the '4's in the tens place are 9, but the '4's in the units place are 5, so total '4's would be 5+9=14. But in reality, the '4's are 4,14,24,34,44, which is 5 '4's, so my method is overcounting.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, my method is wrong because it's counting the tens digit '4's as 9, but in reality, the tens digit '4' is only present in 40-48, which is 9 pages, but each of those pages only has one '4' in the tens place, so that's correct. But the total '4's would be 5 (units) +9 (tens)=14, but in reality, it's only 5 '4's because 44 has two '4's. Wait, no, 44 has a '4' in both tens and units place, so that's two '4's. So, in reality, '4's are:\n\n4: one '4'\n\n14: one '4'\n\n24: one '4'\n\n34: one '4'\n\n44: two '4's\n\nSo, total '4's:1+1+1+1+2=6.\n\nWait, so in reality, '4's are 6, but according to my method, it's 5 (units) +9 (tens)=14, which is way off. So, my method is incorrect.\n\nWait, so the problem is that when I count '4's in the tens place, I'm counting each occurrence, but in reality, each page number may have multiple '4's, so I can't just sum the counts from each place because that would double-count the '4's in numbers like 44. So, my initial approach is wrong because it counts each digit place separately, leading to overcounting.\n\nSo, I need a different approach. Instead of counting each digit place separately, I should count the number of times '4' and '8' appear in all digit places across all page numbers, considering that some numbers may have multiple '4's or '8's.\n\nSo, let me try a different method.\n\nI'll go through each page number and count the number of '4's and '8's, but that's impractical for 488 pages. Instead, I can calculate for each digit place, how many times '4' and '8' appear, but without double-counting.\n\nWait, but how? Because when I count '4's in units, tens, and hundreds places, each occurrence is a separate digit, so the total count is the sum of '4's in each place. Similarly for '8's. So, in the 48-page example, the total '4's would be:\n\nUnits place: '4' appears at 4,14,24,34,44: that's 5 times.\n\nTens place: '4' appears at 40-48: 9 times.\n\nBut in reality, 44 has two '4's, so the total '4's are 5 (units) +9 (tens) =14, but the actual count is 6 '4's because 44 is counted twice. Wait, but that's not correct because each '4' in a different place is a separate occurrence. So, in 44, there are two '4's: one in units and one in tens. So, the total '4's are indeed 5 (units) +9 (tens)=14, but in reality, the page numbers only have 6 '4's because each page number is counted once, but the digits are separate. Wait, no, each digit is a separate occurrence. So, in the 48-page example, the total '4's are 14, but when I list them out, I get 6 '4's because each page number is counted once, but each '4' digit is counted separately.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Each page number is a separate entity, and each digit in the page number is a separate occurrence. So, in page 44, there are two '4's, so it contributes two to the total '4' count. So, in the 48-page example, the total '4's are indeed 14, but when I manually count, I see:\n\nPages with '4's:\n\n4:1\n\n14:1\n\n24:1\n\n34:1\n\n44:2\n\n40-48: each has a '4' in tens place except 44, which we've already counted. Wait, no, 40-48: each page from 40-48 has a '4' in the tens place, so that's 9 '4's in the tens place. So, including 44, which has two '4's, the total '4's are:\n\nUnits place:4,14,24,34,44:5\n\nTens place:40-48:9\n\nBut 44 is included in both, so it's counted twice, which is correct because it has two '4's.\n\nSo, total '4's:5+9=14.\n\nBut when I list the '4's in each page number:\n\n4:1\n\n14:1\n\n24:1\n\n34:1\n\n44:2\n\n40:1\n\n41:1\n\n42:1\n\n43:1\n\n45:1\n\n46:1\n\n47:1\n\n48:1\n\nWait, that's 14 '4's. So, my initial method was correct, and the confusion was because I was miscounting the actual '4's. So, in the 48-page example, the total '4's are indeed 14, which matches the sum from units and tens places.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem, my initial method was correct, and the difference is indeed 90.\n\nTherefore, the number of '4's printed is 90 more than the number of '8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of '4's printed is 90 more than the number of '8's.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Count '4's and '8's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.**\n\n2. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total '4's: 49 (48 full blocks + 1 partial block)\n   - Total '8's: 49 (same as '4's)\n\n3. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Total '4's: 50 (40 from full hundreds + 10 from partial)\n   - Total '8's: 49 (40 from full hundreds + 9 from partial)\n\n4. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears 89 times (pages 400-488)\n   - '8' appears 0 times\n\n5. **Total Counts:**\n   - '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n6. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by 90. So, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a three-digit number, right? From 1 to 488. So, the numbers go from 001 to 488, but actually, page 1 is just 1, not 001. Wait, but when considering digits, maybe it's easier to think of all page numbers as three-digit numbers by padding with leading zeros. That might make it easier to count the occurrences of each digit in each place.\n\nSo, if I consider each page number as a three-digit number, from 001 to 488, that might help me systematically count how many times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nFirst, let me consider the units place. The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place? Well, for each digit from 0 to 9, it appears once every 10 numbers. So, in 488 pages, the units digit cycles 48 times completely (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). Wait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles and then 8 extra numbers. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place, and then the digit 0 appears 48 times, and digits 1 through 8 appear one more time in the extra 8 numbers. Wait, no, actually, the units digit cycles every 10, so from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but 488 is less than 490, so actually, the last cycle is only up to 488. Wait, maybe I should calculate it differently.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times each digit appears in the units place can be calculated as follows: For each digit d from 0 to 9, the number of times it appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) multiplied by 1, plus the number of times it appears in the incomplete decade if any.\n\nSo, the total number of complete decades in 488 pages is 48 (since 48*10=480). Then, the remaining 8 pages are 481 to 488.\n\nSo, for each digit d, the count in the units place is 48 (from the complete decades) plus 1 if d is less than or equal to 8 (since 481 to 488 have units digits from 1 to 8). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so units digits go up to 8. So, for digits 1 through 8, they each appear once more in the units place, while digits 9 and 0 don't appear in the incomplete decade.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the incomplete decade (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, each digit from 1 to 8 appears once, and 9 and 0 don't appear in the units place in this incomplete decade.\n\nTherefore, the count for each digit in the units place is:\n\n- For digits 0: 48 times (only in the complete decades, as 0 doesn't appear in the incomplete decade's units place)\n- For digits 1-8: 48 +1 =49 times each\n- For digit 9: 48 times\n\nWait, but wait, in the first 480 pages, the units digit cycles 48 times, so each digit 0-9 appears 48 times. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), digits 1-8 each appear once more in the units place. So, yes, digits 1-8 have 49 occurrences each, and 0 and 9 have 48 each.\n\nSo, in the units place, the number of 4's is 49, and the number of 8's is also 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Then, we have 88 pages beyond that (401-488). Wait, no, 400 is the end of the fourth hundred, so from 401 to 488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (401-410, ..., 481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, let's see.\n\nFor the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, in 400 pages, each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0 (since 401 is 4 0 1, 402 is 4 0 2, etc.)\nFrom 411-420: tens digit is 1\n...\nFrom 481-490: tens digit is 8, but we only go up to 488, so the tens digit is 8 for 488.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. The tens digit in 401-410 is 0, because 401 is 4 0 1, 402 is 4 0 2, etc. Then 411-420: tens digit is 1, and so on. So, in the range 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each tens digit appears a certain number of times.\n\nWait, from 401-488, that's 88 numbers. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears only 8 times.\n\nWait, no, let's see:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers\n- 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers\n- 421-430: tens digit 2, 10 numbers\n- 431-440: tens digit 3, 10 numbers\n- 441-450: tens digit 4, 10 numbers\n- 451-460: tens digit 5, 10 numbers\n- 461-470: tens digit 6, 10 numbers\n- 471-480: tens digit 7, 10 numbers\n- 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 numbers\n\nSo, in the tens place, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and digit 8 appears 8 times in the incomplete set.\n\nTherefore, the total number of times each digit appears in the tens place is:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) +10 (from the incomplete 401-488) =50 times each\n- For digit 8: 4*10 +8=48 times\n- For digit 9: 4*10=40 times (since 9 doesn't appear in the tens place beyond 400, as 488 is less than 500)\n\nWait, no, wait. The complete hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, so 4*10=40 times for each digit 0-9 in the tens place.\n\nThen, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), as we saw, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 8 times. So, adding that to the 40 from the complete hundreds:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 40 +10=50 each\n- Digit 8:40 +8=48\n- Digit 9:40 (since 9 doesn't appear in the tens place in 401-488)\n\nWait, but actually, in the tens place, digit 9 doesn't appear at all beyond 400 because the book ends at 488. So, digit 9 appears only in the first 400 pages, 40 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the number of 4's is 50, and the number of 8's is 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- Digit 0: pages 1-99, so 99 times? Wait, but actually, in three-digit terms, pages 1-99 are considered as 001-099, so the hundreds digit is 0 for all of them. So, digit 0 appears 99 times in the hundreds place? Wait, no, each page from 1 to 99 has a hundreds digit of 0, so that's 99 numbers, each contributing one 0 in the hundreds place. So, 99 times.\n\n- Digit 1: 100-199, which is 100 numbers, so 100 times.\n\n- Digit 2: 200-299, 100 times.\n\n- Digit 3: 300-399, 100 times.\n\n- Digit 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nDigits 5-9 don't appear in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 0:99 times\n- Digit 1:100 times\n- Digit 2:100 times\n- Digit 3:100 times\n- Digit 4:89 times\n- Digits 5-9:0 times\n\nSo, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89, and 8's in the hundreds place: well, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit is only up to 4. So, digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFirst, for digit 4:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check that. For 4's:\n\nUnits:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits:49, Tens:48, Hundreds:0. 49+48=97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. Therefore, the difference is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check each place again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nEach digit 1-8 appears 49 times, so 4 appears 49 times, correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nDigits 0-7 appear 50 times each, so 4 appears 50 times, correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nDigit 4 appears 89 times, correct.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:48\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nSo, 49+48=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me think again about the hundreds place for 4. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that 488-400+1=89. Yes, because 400 is included, so 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about the hundreds place: from 1-399, the hundreds digit is 0,1,2,3. From 400-488, it's 4. So, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nIn the tens place, for digit 8, we have 48 occurrences. Let me check that.\n\nIn the tens place, in the first 400 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 8 times. So, 40+8=48 for digit 8 in the tens place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nIn the units place, digit 8 appears 49 times: 48 from the complete decades and 1 more in the incomplete decade (since 488 is included, units digit 8 appears once more). Wait, no, in the incomplete decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, total units digit 8's:48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, digit 4 appears 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but in the units place, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the incomplete cycle (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (at 484). So, total 48+1=49 times, correct.\n\nSame for 8: 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48 times, plus one more in the incomplete cycle at 488, so 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, in the incomplete cycle, units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once, so 48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place for both 4 and 8 is 49 each.\n\nTens place:4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times.\n\nHundreds place:4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nHmm, so the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 times, correct.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the number of 4's in the hundreds place: the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately and sum them up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of each digit place separately.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n can be calculated as:\n\nfloor((n + 1) / 10) * 1 + (1 if (d <= (n + 1) % 10) else 0)\n\nWait, but let me test this formula.\n\nFor n=488, for digit d=4:\n\nfloor((488 +1)/10)=floor(489/10)=48\n\nThen, check if 4 <= (489 %10)=9, which it is, so add 1.\n\nSo, total 48+1=49 times, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nfloor(489/10)=48, and 8 <=9, so 48+1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nThe formula is a bit more complex. The number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\nfloor(n / 100) * 10 + extra\n\nWhere extra depends on the tens digit and the units digit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 times for each digit, so 4*10=40 times for each digit.\n\nThen, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8, with 0 appearing 10 times (401-410), 1 appearing 10 times (411-420), ..., 8 appearing 8 times (481-488).\n\nSo, for digit d in the tens place beyond the 400:\n\nIf d is less than 8, it appears 10 times.\n\nIf d is 8, it appears 8 times.\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\nIn the first 400, 40 times, plus in the remaining 88, 10 times (since 4 is less than 8), so total 50.\n\nFor d=8:\n\nIn the first 400, 40 times, plus in the remaining 88, 8 times, so total 48.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place:\n\nDigit d appears in the hundreds place for each range where the hundreds digit is d.\n\nSo, for d=4, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nFor d=8, there are no numbers in the book where the hundreds digit is 8, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+48 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nSo, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach to be sure.\n\nAnother way is to iterate through each digit place and count the occurrences.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, 49 each for 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\n4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, 4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place again. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so 0 appears 99 times. From 100-199, 1 appears 100 times. Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399. From 400-488, 4 appears 89 times. So, yes, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 48 times in complete decades (1-480).\n   - In the incomplete decade (481-488), digits 1-8 each appear once.\n   - **4's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **8's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 40 times in the first 400 pages.\n   - In 401-488, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 8 times.\n   - **4's:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **8's:** 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 1-399, digits 0-3 appear 100, 100, 100, and 100 times respectively.\n   - From 400-488, digit 4 appears 89 times.\n   - **4's:** 89\n   - **8's:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and how digits are used in them.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. Each page number is printed once, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll have to check each place for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4, let's count how many times it appears in each place.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, from 1-10, it's on page 4; from 11-20, it's on page 14, and so on.\n\nHow many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete set, 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, on page 484. So that's one more. So total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Each set of 10 contributes one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 480, which is 48 sets of 10, that's 48 fours. Then from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 4 appears once here, on 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 in the tens place appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive numbers.\n\nSo, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nFrom 1-100: 40-49, that's 10 numbers.\nFrom 101-200: 140-149, another 10.\nFrom 201-300: 240-249, another 10.\nFrom 301-400: 340-349, another 10.\nFrom 401-488: Now, 440-449 would be the next block, but 440-449 is within 488, right? Wait, 440 to 449 is 10 numbers, and 450-488 is 40 numbers. So yes, 440-449 is within 488. So that's another 10.\n\nWait, so that's 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So total tens place 4's: 50.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The digit 4 in the hundreds place appears from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 fours.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place again. As before, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1-480, that's 48 sets of 10, so 48 eights. Then from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once on page 488. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place. The digit 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So let's count.\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89, that's 10 eights.\nFrom 101-200: 180-189, another 10.\nFrom 201-300: 280-289, another 10.\nFrom 301-400: 380-389, another 10.\nFrom 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So in the tens place, each of these blocks contributes 10 except the last one, which contributes 9.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of these, right? So that's 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9 in 480-488. So 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 1-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4\u00d710=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would appear from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me go through each digit place again for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 sets of 10 (1-480) with 4 in units: 48. Then 481-488: 484 has a 4 in units, so +1. Total:49.\n\nTens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with 4 in hundreds place. So 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 sets of 10 (1-480) with 8 in units: 48. Then 481-488: 488 has an 8 in units, so +1. Total:49.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: each 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. Then 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 eights. Total:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: None, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility I overcounted somewhere?\n\nWait, for the units place of 4's, from 1-480, 48 sets of 10, so 48 fours. Then 481-488: 484 is the only one with a 4 in units, so +1. So 49, correct.\n\nFor tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, etc., each 10, so 5 blocks, 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. So 89. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: same logic, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: 80-89, etc., 4 blocks of 10, so 40, plus 480-488:9, total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo 4's:188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4. There are 48 complete sets (1-480) and one additional in 481-488 (484). Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.). Total: 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Numbers 400-488 contribute 89 fours. Total: 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 8. There are 48 complete sets (1-480) and one additional in 481-488 (488). Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. There are 4 such blocks (80-89, etc.), plus 9 in 480-488. Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFirst, let's think about the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 each appear once in the units place. So from page 1 to page 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra pages (pages 481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, we have those extra 8 pages. Let me check what the units digits are from 481 to 488. They are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So in the units place, there's one more 8 and one more 4 in those extra pages. So that would make the total units place 4's as 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's as 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 to 9 ten times each. So for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. Since the book has 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, what about the last partial hundred, 401-488? The tens digit here cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-490, but wait, we only go up to 488. So the tens digits in 401-488 go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except maybe the last one. Wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (401-410 is the first ten, but actually, 401-410 is 10 pages, right? Wait, no, 401-410 is 10 pages, 411-420 another 10, and so on up to 481-490, but since we stop at 488, the last tens digit is 8, which only has 8 pages (481-488). \n\nWait, no, actually, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (each 10 pages) plus 8 pages. So the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which appears 8 times. So for the tens place in 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450) and the digit 8 appears 10 times (from 481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the 8 in the tens place actually appears only 8 times. Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for those 8 pages. So in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times in this partial hundred. \n\nWait, but earlier, in the complete hundreds, each 100 had 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place. So in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450), and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). So in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50. The total number of 8's in the tens place is 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me correct that. The complete hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So 4*10=40 for 4's and 40 for 8's. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The 4 in the tens place occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so that's 10 more 4's, making the total 40+10=50 for 4's. For 8's in the tens place, it occurs in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 pages, so 8 more 8's, making the total 40+8=48 for 8's. So in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 48.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. So the hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book doesn't have pages beyond 488, so the hundreds digit is only up to 4. So 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences. \n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought in the units place, 4's and 8's were both 49. Let me double-check that.\n\nIn the units place, each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8. There are 48 full groups (1-480), which gives 48 each. Then, pages 481-488: units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So units place 4's: 48 +1=49, 8's:48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, as I calculated earlier, 4's:50, 8's:48.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recount the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, for each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. So 4 hundreds give 40 each.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 more 4's, making total 50. The tens digit 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 pages, so 8 more 8's, making total 48.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97\n\nDifference:188 -97=91\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm counting the hundreds place correctly. Let me check again.\n\nFrom page 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. Each of these pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So 4's in hundreds place:89, correct.\n\n8's in hundreds place:0, correct.\n\nSo yes, 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the difference would be smaller. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately for each digit place.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits place: For every 10 numbers, one 4. So 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 4 once (484). So total units 4's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place: For every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So in 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 more 4's. So total tens 4's:40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place: Similarly, every 10 numbers have one 8. So 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 8 once (488). So total units 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place: For every 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So in 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 481-490, but since we stop at 488, that's 8 pages, so 8 more 8's. So total tens 8's:40+8=48.\n\nHundreds place: As before, 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188 -97=91.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's is being overcounted. Let me check how many pages have 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 pages. So yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd 8's in the hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit is 4 only.\n\nSo yes, 89 is correct for hundreds place 4's.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. The difference is 91.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in Each Digit Place:**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n     - Total complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n     - In each group, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n     - From 1-480: 48 occurrences each.\n     - Pages 481-488: Units digits are 1-8. 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n     - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n     - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n     - Complete hundreds in 488 pages: 4 (1-400).\n     - In each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n     - From 1-400: 40 occurrences each.\n     - Pages 401-488: The tens digit cycles from 0-8.\n       - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n       - 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n     - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50.\n     - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - Pages 1-399: Hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3; no 4 or 8.\n     - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times (488 - 400 + 1).\n     - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89.\n     - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n2. **Summing Up Occurrences:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Total 4's - Total 8's = 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.  \n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can count how many times 4 appears in each place and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two totals.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once in the units place every 10 pages. So, for the units digit, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, right? But wait, I need to check how many complete sets of 10 are in 488 pages.\n\nTo find the number of complete sets of 10, I can divide 488 by 10. That gives me 48 sets with a remainder of 8 pages. So, in each set of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 sets would give me 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. But then there's an extra 8 pages: pages 481 to 488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (on page 484) and 8 appears once (on page 488). So, adding that, the units place has 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. So, same number so far.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each 100 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages, and the same goes for 8. \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, that's 4 complete sets of 100 pages (400 pages) and an additional 88 pages. So, for the tens place, in the first 400 pages, 4 appears 4 times 10, which is 40 times, and 8 also appears 40 times. Now, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here?\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for each ten's digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each occur? Each ten's digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for the last one, which might be cut short. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the tens digit goes up to 8, but only up to 488. So, for the tens digit 4, it occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. Similarly, for 8, it occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, in the last 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, adding to the previous 40, the total for 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8's, it's 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digits go through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, each ten's digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for the last one, which is only 9 times because 488 is the end. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times (440-449), and for 8, it's 9 times (480-488). So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, it's 1, 200-299 it's 2, 300-399 it's 3, and 400-488 it's 4. So, how many times does each hundreds digit appear?\n\nFor 4's in the hundreds place: pages 400-488. That's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: Hmm, does 8 appear in the hundreds place in this book? The book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89\nTotal 8's in the hundreds place: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference. Did I count correctly?\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 488 pages. Every 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- First 400 pages: 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for both.\n- Remaining 88 pages: 401-488. Tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages with hundreds digit 4. So, 89 4's.\n- 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place. So, 0 8's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 pages have 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 each.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 49, Total 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 pages contribute 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - 400 pages contribute 40 each.\n   - Remaining 88 pages: 440-449 (10 4's) and 480-488 (9 8's).\n   - Total 4's: 50, Total 8's: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488: 89 4's.\n   - 8 doesn't appear here.\n   - Total 4's: 89, Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers will range from 1 to 488, which includes 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), and 3-digit (100-488) numbers.\n\nI think the key here is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have those counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, let me consider the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once. Similarly, from 11 to 20, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 again. This pattern repeats every 10 numbers.\n\nSo, for the units place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. The number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, there's an extra 8 pages beyond the 480th page. So, pages 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits in these pages: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the 481-488 range, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). Therefore, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the units digit 8, in each group of 10, 8 appears once. So, 48 groups would give 48 times, and then in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So, total 8's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, maybe I need to check the tens place as well.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place over 100 numbers. So, for the tens digit, how many times does 4 appear? Let me calculate.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in 401-488.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears in the range 40-49, which is 10 times per hundred. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 10 * 4 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's another 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. From 1-100, the tens digit 4 is in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times. From 201-300, 240-249, 10 times. From 301-400, 340-349, 10 times. So, that's 4*10=40 times. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place is 40 +10=50.\n\nNow, how about the 8's in the tens place? Let's see. From 1-100, the tens digit 8 is in 80-89, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 180-189, another 10 times. From 201-300, 280-289, 10 times. From 301-400, 380-389, 10 times. So, that's 4*10=40 times. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total 8's in the tens place would be 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, so 4's in the tens place are 50, and 8's are 49. So, the difference here is 50 -49=1.\n\nHmm, so so far, in the units and tens places, the 4's are leading by 1. Now, let's check the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit can be 1,2,3, or 4 since the book goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nNow, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can only be up to 4 in this book, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in hundreds place:89, and 8's:0, so the difference here is 89-0=89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place.\n\nUnits place: 4's=49, 8's=49, difference=0.\n\nTens place:4's=50,8's=49, difference=1.\n\nHundreds place:4's=89,8's=0, difference=89.\n\nTotal difference:0+1+89=90.\n\nWait, so 4's appear 90 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nEach 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNumber of complete tens:48 (since 48*10=480). So, 48*1=48 for 4's and 48 for 8's.\n\nThen, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488). Units digits:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So, total 4's:48+1=49, 8's:48+1=49. So, units place difference is 0.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400). So, 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50 for 4's.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, 4 hundreds contribute 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49 for 8's.\n\nSo, tens place difference:50-49=1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. So, 0 times.\n\nHundreds place difference:89-0=89.\n\nAdding up the differences:0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=90.\n\nTherefore, 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up the differences:0+1+89=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total page numbers: 488.\n   - Complete groups of 10: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Each group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - 48 groups \u00d7 1 = 48 for both 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining pages (481-488): Units digits 1-8.\n   - 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total units place: 4's = 48 +1 =49, 8's=48 +1=49.\n   - Difference in units place: 49 -49=0.\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n   - 4's in tens place: 4 \u00d710=40.\n   - 8's in tens place: 4 \u00d710=40.\n   - Last partial hundred (401-488): Tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times).\n   - 4's total:40 +10=50.\n   - Tens digit 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n   - 8's total:40 +9=49.\n   - Difference in tens place:50 -49=1.\n\n3. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - Hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488: 89 numbers.\n   - Hundreds digit 8 never appears since the book ends at 488.\n   - 4's:89, 8's:0.\n   - Difference in hundreds place:89 -0=89.\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Units:0, Tens:1, Hundreds:89.\n   - Total difference:0 +1 +89=90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place up to 488?\n\nWell, the total number of pages is 488. So, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last partial group is 481 to 488, which includes 484, so that's another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49 times? Wait, no, actually, each complete group of 10 contributes one 4, and since 488 is the last page, which is 48 full tens (480) and 8 more pages. So, the units digit 4 occurs once every 10 pages, so 48 times for the full groups, and then in the last 8 pages (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but actually, when you have 488 pages, the number of complete tens is 48, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, looking at the tens digit. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-488 is also part of the book. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach block of 100 pages has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there?\n\nLet me calculate how many hundreds are there. 488 is between 400 and 500, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's five blocks, but the last block is only up to 488.\n\nIn each full block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). So, from 0-99: 10 times, 100-199: 10 times, 200-299: 10 times, 300-399: 10 times, and 400-488: how many times does the tens digit 4 appear?\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and then from 450-488, the tens digit is 5,6,7,8, so no more 4's in the tens place. Wait, no, 440-449 is 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, and then 450-488 is 40 numbers where tens digit is 5,6,7,8, so no more 4's. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 pages, but the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, yes, 10 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 10 (from 0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 includes 400-449 and 450-488. So, in 400-449, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449). So, yes, 10 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 4 blocks of 100 (each contributing 10) plus the 400-449 block contributing another 10, so 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but actually, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but 400-449 is only part of the 400-488 range. So, yes, that's correct.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nWait, but actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens (each contributing 1) plus one more in the last partial ten (484), so 49.\n\nTens place: 10 in each of the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and 10 in 400-449, so 5*10=50.\n\nYes, so 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nAgain, considering units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. Units place: How many times does 8 appear in the units digit from 1 to 488?\n\nEach group of 10 has one 8 in the units place (8, 18, 28, etc.). So, number of complete tens is 48 (since 488 /10 =48.8). Each contributes one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), we have 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1 =49.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is included, so yes, 488 is the last page, so units digit 8 occurs once in the last partial group.\n\n2. Tens place: How many times does 8 appear in the tens digit?\n\nThe tens digit is 8 for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nEach of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).\n\nWait, let's count:\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 +1 =9 numbers.\n\nSo, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds digit?\n\nThe hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's:188, 8's:98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 8's, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times, correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and one more in the last partial ten, so 49.\n\nSo, 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nFor 4's, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check the tens place for 4's. From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-449, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place for 4's: 48 full tens, each with one 4, and one more in the last partial ten, so 49.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's, units:49, tens:49, so 98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it another way. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit is >=4, which it is (8), so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit is >=8, which it is (8), so 48 +1=49.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)*10=4*10=40, plus the remainder: 88/100=0.88, so the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 40+10=50.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the formula for the tens digit is a bit different.\n\nWait, the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to n is calculated as:\n\nLet me recall the formula: For digit d in the tens place, the count is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10\n\nremainder = n % 100\n\nif remainder >= 10*(d+1), then add 10\n\nelse if remainder >= 10*d, then add (remainder - 10*d +1)\n\nelse, add 0.\n\nSo, for 4 in the tens place up to 488:\n\nn=488.\n\ncount = (488 // 100)*10 =4*10=40.\n\nremainder=488%100=88.\n\nSince 88 >=10*(4+1)=50, so add 10.\n\nTotal tens place 4's:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place:\n\ncount=(488//100)*10=4*10=40.\n\nremainder=88.\n\nSince 88 >=10*(8+1)=90? No, 88<90, so check if remainder >=10*8=80.\n\n88>=80, so add (88-80+1)=9.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nWhich matches what I had before.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nFor 4 in hundreds place:\n\ncount=(488//1000)*100=0.\n\nremainder=488%1000=488.\n\nSince 488 >=400 (which is 100*(4)), so add (488 -400 +1)=89.\n\nSo, hundreds place 4's:89.\n\nFor 8 in hundreds place:\n\ncount=(488//1000)*100=0.\n\nremainder=488.\n\nSince 488 <800, so hundreds place 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49(units)+49(tens)+0(hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because I feel like maybe I'm overcounting somewhere, but I can't spot the mistake. Let me try a smaller example to test my method.\n\nSuppose the book has 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's?\n\nPage numbers:1-20.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits:4,14 ->2 times.\n\nTens:40-49, but we only go up to 20, so tens digit 4 doesn't appear.\n\nHundreds: none.\n\nTotal 4's:2.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nUnits:8,18->2 times.\n\nTens: none.\n\nHundreds: none.\n\nTotal 8's:2.\n\nDifference:0.\n\nWait, but according to my method:\n\nUnits 4's: floor(20/10)=2, and since last digit is 0, which is <4, so 2.\n\nTens 4's: floor(20/100)=0, so 0.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 4's:2.\n\nUnits 8's: floor(20/10)=2, and last digit is 0 <8, so 2.\n\nTens 8's: floor(20/100)=0, so 0.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 8's:2.\n\nDifference:0. Correct.\n\nAnother test: 50 pages.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits: floor(50/10)=5, last digit is 0 <4? No, 0 <4, so 5.\n\nWait, no, wait, the formula is:\n\nUnits digit 4's: floor(50/10)=5, and if last digit >=4, add 1. Last digit is 0, which is <4, so 5.\n\nWait, but in 1-50, the units digit 4 appears at 4,14,24,34,44: that's 5 times.\n\nTens digit 4's: floor(50/100)=0, but remainder=50.\n\nSince 50 >=10*(4+1)=50, so add 10.\n\nWait, but 50 is exactly 50, so do we add 10? But from 40-49, that's 10 numbers, but 50 is the last page, so 40-49 are included, so yes, 10.\n\nSo, tens place 4's:10.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 4's:5+10=15.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits: floor(50/10)=5, last digit is 0 <8, so 5.\n\nTens: floor(50/100)=0, remainder=50.\n\nSince 50 >=10*(8+1)=90? No, so check if >=80? 50 <80, so add 0.\n\nSo, tens place 8's:0.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 8's:5.\n\nDifference:15-5=10.\n\nWait, but in reality, in 1-50:\n\n4's: units:5 (4,14,24,34,44), tens:10 (40-49), so 15.\n\n8's: units:5 (8,18,28,38,48), tens:0, so 5.\n\nDifference:10. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for this case.\n\nSo, going back, in the original problem, the difference is 90.\n\nSo, I think I can be confident that the answer is 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n### Counting the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**:\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4.\n   - Number of complete groups of 10: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n   - In the last partial group (481-488), 484 contributes one more 4.\n   - Total: \\( 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place**:\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n   - From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-449, each contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place**:\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\nTotal occurrences of 4: \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n### Counting the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place**:\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 8.\n   - Number of complete groups of 10: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n   - In the last partial group (481-488), 488 contributes one more 8.\n   - Total: \\( 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place**:\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place, except the last block which contributes 9.\n   - From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 480-488, contributing 10, 10, 10, 10, and 9 respectively.\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place**:\n   - No occurrences since the book only goes up to 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\nTotal occurrences of 8: \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n### Difference:\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider how many times each digit appears in each position: units, tens, hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nFirst, I think I should calculate the number of times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's look at each position one by one.\n\n1. **Units place:** For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. So, 48 times 1 equals 48 occurrences. But wait, the last group might not be complete. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last group is 480-488, which includes 488. The units digit in this last group goes up to 8, so 4 appears once here as well. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, that's another 10. Therefore, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me compute that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many groups of 10? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. The last group is 480-488, which includes 488, so the units digit 8 appears once here. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in blocks of 100. Each hundred has a set where the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). So, in 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributes 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488. The tens digit here is 8 for 10 numbers: 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, actually, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 489, but since we only have up to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. But wait, in terms of the tens place, each block is 10 numbers, so 480-489 would be the next block, but we only have 488, so that's 9 numbers. Hmm, but does that affect the count? Wait, no, because the tens digit is 8 for each number from 480 to 489, but since we stop at 488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but in the tens place, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-489, but since we only go to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, does that mean we have 9 instead of 10? Wait, but in the tens place, it's 10 numbers per hundred, so in the last hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but we only have up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times in the last partial hundred. Therefore, total tens place 8's are 40 (from the four full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier for the 4's, in the tens place, we had 50 because from 401-488, the tens digit 4 was in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, maybe for 8's, it's similar but ends earlier. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the 800s, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-488, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times. So, 4 hundreds would give 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I did the 4's, in the tens place, I had 50 because from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, for 8's, it's 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again for 8's. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last group, 480-488, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, total 4's were 188, and total 8's are 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the tens place for 4's, I had 50, which was 40 from the four full hundreds and 10 from 440-449 in the last partial hundred. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the tens place was 49, which was 40 from the four full hundreds and 9 from 480-488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can think of each digit position separately and ensure I didn't double-count or miss any.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- 4's: Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (480-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total 49.\n\n- 8's: Similarly, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (480-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total 49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- 4's: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 50.\n\n- 8's: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n- 8's: From 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place for 8's in the last partial hundred.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. Therefore, the tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Maybe I can think of it another way. For each digit position, calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus 1 if the last number is >= 484. Since 488 >= 484, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- 8's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus 1 if the last number is >= 488. Since 488 is exactly the last number, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: floor(488/100) = 4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- 8's: floor(488/100) = 4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: floor(488/1000) = 0, but since we're dealing with 3-digit numbers, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n- 8's: 0, as before.\n\nSo, the counts are as before. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Calculate the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (480 instances) + 1 in the last group (484) = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (40 each) + 10 in the last partial hundred (440-449) = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers from 400-488 = 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (480 instances) + 1 in the last group (488) = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (40 each) + 9 in the last partial hundred (480-488) = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 (since the book ends at 488).\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Find the difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8, and then subtract the two totals to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I think I need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since 488 is a three-digit number, the page numbers go from 1 to 488, so I should check each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's look at the units place first. In every set of ten consecutive numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times from the full sets, and then in the extra 8 numbers, does 4 appear? Let me see: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Yes, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place for 4. In the tens place, 4 appears in a block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes ten 4's in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. The first block is 40-49, that's one. Then 140-149 is two, 240-249 is three, 340-349 is four, and 440-449 is five. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's five blocks, each contributing ten 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 include 440-449, which is ten numbers, but 440 is the start. So yes, five blocks, so 50 times. But wait, let me check if 488 is beyond 449, which it is, so no problem. So tens place 4's are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 4. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nSo total 4's are units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 4's. But in the tens place, I considered five blocks, each of ten numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, plus one more in 484, so 49.\n\nSo 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with units place: In every ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So up to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place for 8: 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last block. Each block contributes ten 8's in the tens place. So how many blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 is one, 180-189 is two, 280-289 is three, 380-389 is four, and 480-488 is five. But wait, 480-488 is only nine numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So in the tens place, each block contributes ten 8's except the last one, which contributes nine. So the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have ten 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has nine numbers, so nine 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is nine numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So yes, nine numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so nine 8's. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the tens place for 8. Each block of 80-89, etc., but in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, right? So that's correct, nine times.\n\nWait, but when I counted the 4's in the tens place, I had five blocks, each contributing ten 4's, so 50. For 8's, I have five blocks, but the last one only has nine, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again because I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the 8's in the tens place, I have 49, which is 40 from the first four blocks and 9 from 480-488. That adds up to 49, correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. For 4's, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in 484, which is in the 48th set plus 484, so that's one more, so 49. For 8's, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then in 488, which is the 48th set plus 488, so one more, so 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let's see: The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes ten 4's in the tens place. So that's five blocks, each with ten 4's, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nWait, but for 8's in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one only has nine numbers, so nine 8's. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\n8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I feel like the difference might be smaller. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: For each ten numbers, 4 appears once. So total units place 4's: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4, so actually, it's 48 times, but wait, in 480-488, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So total units place 4's:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: For each hundred numbers, 4 appears in the tens place for ten numbers (e.g., 40-49). So total tens place 4's: (number of hundreds) *10. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so up to 400-499, but our book is only up to 488. So how many complete tens blocks with 4 in the tens place are there?\n\nFrom 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in:\n\n40-49: ten numbers.\n\n140-149: ten.\n\n240-249: ten.\n\n340-349: ten.\n\n440-449: ten.\n\n480-488: wait, no, the tens digit is 8 here, not 4. So 440-449 is the last block with 4 in the tens place, which is ten numbers. So total tens place 4's:5 blocks *10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo total 4's:49 +50 +89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: similar to 4's, 8 appears once every ten numbers. So floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=8, so the 49th occurrence is at 488. So units place 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block contributes ten 8's except the last one, which is only nine numbers (480-488). So:\n\n80-89:10.\n\n180-189:10.\n\n280-289:10.\n\n380-389:10.\n\n480-488:9.\n\nTotal tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place up to 488, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so that's consistent. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just think again. Is there any chance I double-counted or missed something?\n\nWait, in the units place for 4's: up to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. So from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each contributes ten 4's, so 5 blocks, 50. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8's:80-89,180-189,...,480-488. First four blocks contribute ten each, last block nine, so 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: none, so 0.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a number from 1 to 488, so each number can be one, two, three, or four digits long. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I should consider each digit position separately: units, tens, hundreds, and thousands. Since 488 is a three-digit number, the thousands place will only be relevant if the page numbers go into four digits, but since 488 is the last page, the thousands place will only be present for page 400 and above, but actually, 400 is less than 488, so the thousands place is only for 400 to 488. Wait, no, 400 is a three-digit number, so maybe the thousands place isn't needed here. Let me clarify: page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the maximum number is 488, which is a three-digit number. So, the digit positions are units, tens, and hundreds. But wait, for numbers less than 100, the hundreds place is zero, but we don't print leading zeros, so maybe I should consider each digit position separately without worrying about leading zeros.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of all page numbers as three-digit numbers by padding with leading zeros, but that might complicate things because leading zeros aren't actually printed. So maybe it's better to handle each digit position for each range of numbers. Let me try to structure this.\n\nI can split the counting into units, tens, and hundreds places. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So in each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each complete block, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so for 48 blocks, that's 48 times 4's and 48 times 8's in the units place.\n\nNow, for the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So in this partial block, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So in the units place, total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So so far, both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So for each digit (including 4 and 8), it appears 10 times in the tens place per 100 numbers. Now, how many complete hundreds are in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.) and the same for 8. So that's 4 times 10 = 40 occurrences for each in the tens place from the complete hundreds.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 as follows: 401-410 (tens digit 0), 411-420 (1), 421-430 (2), 431-440 (3), 441-450 (4), 451-460 (5), 461-470 (6), 471-480 (7), 481-490 (8), but wait, 488 is the last page, so actually, 481-488 is only 8 numbers, so the tens digit here is 8 for 481-488, but only 8 numbers, so how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? Let me think. From 480-489, the tens digit is 8, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480 is included? Wait, 480 is page 480, which is within 401-488. So from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). But wait, 480 is in the 401-488 range, so yes, so in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. But wait, does 480 count? Yes, because 480 is within 401-488. So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in this partial block.\n\nBut wait, let me check: from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So for the tens digit 4, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 occurrences. Similarly, for 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the partial block.\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place: 4's are 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial block) = 50, and 8's are 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from partial block) = 49.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because in the partial block, 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. And 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the end. So 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit cycles every 1000 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (not printed, so we can ignore leading zeros).\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total in the hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each, plus in the last partial block (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So units place: 48 +1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nIn the tens place, for complete hundreds (1-400), each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place, so 4 times 10 = 40 each. Then in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times. So 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 occurs from 400-488, which is 89 times, and 8 never occurs there.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89. So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct. And 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, correct.\n\nUnits place seems correct too.\n\nSo yes, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one '4' and one '8'.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (1-480) and a partial block (481-488).\n   - Complete blocks: 48 occurrences each for '4' and '8'.\n   - Partial block: '4' appears once (484), '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (1-400) and a partial block (401-488).\n   - Complete blocks: 40 each for '4' and '8'.\n   - Partial block:\n     - '4' appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: '4' = 50, '8' = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: '4' = 89, '8' = 0.\n\n4. **Total Occurrences:**\n   - '4': 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - '8': 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. That seems like a good approach because each place can be analyzed for the frequency of 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) from page 1 to page 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once, and the same goes for 8. For example, from 1-10, 4 is in 4, and 8 is in 8. So, in each block of 10, both digits appear once. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 pages (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from the complete blocks) plus 1 if 4 appears in the partial block. Wait, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 does appear once in that partial block (484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: 48 complete blocks give 48 eights, and in the partial block, 488 is the last page, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal, each appearing 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, the cycle is every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each 100-page block. So, for example, in pages 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nSo, how many complete 100-page blocks are in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488.\n\nFor each complete block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the same for 8. So, for 4 complete blocks, that's 4*10 = 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the partial block from 401-488. Let's look at the tens digits here. The pages go from 401 to 488. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in this range. So, when does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440 to 449, the tens digit is 4. That's 10 pages, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times here.\n\nWhat about 8 in the tens place? That would be from 480 to 488. The tens digit is 8, so that's 9 pages: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, actually, from 480 to 489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial block.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 (from partial block) = 50.\n\nFor 8's, it's 40 (from complete blocks) + 9 (from partial block) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's are more by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. So, for each 100 pages, the hundreds digit is the same for all pages in that block. For example, pages 1-99 have hundreds digit 0 (but since we start at 1, maybe we can ignore that, but let's think carefully).\n\nWait, actually, page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4 in this book, since it's 488 pages. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in all places.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is total 4's minus total 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), units digits go from 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place counts: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds *10=40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 4's total 50, 8's total 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to find how many more 4's than 8's. So, the answer is 90. Hmm, but let me think again because sometimes when counting digit occurrences, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the tens place, in the last partial block, 480-488: that's 9 pages, so 9 times 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSo, that's correct. So, 10 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, both have the same count.\n\nSo, the difference comes from the hundreds and tens places.\n\nWait, 89 in hundreds for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nIn tens, 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete decades: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - In each complete decade, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n   - Partial decade (481-488): 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (since 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88).\n   - In each complete hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total tens place: 4*10 +10 = 50 for 4; 4*10 +9 =49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place: 89 for 4; 0 for 8.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of each digit.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers start at 1 and go up to 488. So, each page number is a number from 1 to 488. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears, then find the difference between those two counts.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can systematically count the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nLet's start by considering the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each group of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, for the units place, in each of the 48 full groups, there's one 4 and one 8. That gives 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place.\n\nBut wait, we also have the last 8 numbers: 481-488. Let's check the units digits here. 481 has 1, 482 has 2, 483 has 3, 484 has 4, 485 has 5, 486 has 6, 487 has 7, 488 has 8. So, in this partial group, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, adding that, the total units place counts are 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. So, so far, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, in each 100 numbers, there are 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's from the tens place in the full hundreds.\n\nThen, we have the last 88 pages: 401-488. Let's look at the tens digit here. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nWait, actually, the tens digit in 401-488 cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in this range, the tens digit is 4 for 441-450, which is 10 numbers, and 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 10 4's and 8 8's in the last partial hundred.\n\nAdding that to our previous counts: 40 + 10 = 50 4's and 40 + 8 = 48 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. The tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 8's. So yes, that's correct. So, total tens place counts are 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is the hundreds digit 4, right? Because 400 is the start of the hundreds digit 4, going up to 488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let's total up all the digits:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then the last 8 numbers (481-488) have one 4 and one 8, so total units 4's: 49, 8's: 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So 4 full hundreds give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450 (10 numbers) and 8 in 481-488 (8 numbers). So, 10 4's and 8 8's. So, total tens 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's: 40+8=48. That looks right.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 full groups (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each full hundred (e.g., 1-100) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds, contributing 40 each.\n   - In 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (441-450) and 8 for 8 numbers (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488 (89 numbers).\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Because the number of times a digit appears can vary depending on its position.\n\nFirst, let me think about the units place. For every block of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, right? Like pages 4, 14, 24, etc. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once every 10 pages in the units place, like 8, 18, 28, etc. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48, and the same for 8's. But wait, what about the extra 8 pages? Those are pages 481 to 488. In the units place of these, the digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 8 appears once more in the units place, making the total for 8's in units place 48 + 1 = 49. But 4 doesn't appear in these extra pages because the units digits are 1 through 8, so 4 is not among them. So, in the units place, 4's are 48 and 8's are 49. That means 8's are one more than 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to find how many more 4's than 8's. So, maybe I should calculate the difference later after considering all places. Let me proceed.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 pages, from 40 to 49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 80 to 89, which is also 10 times. So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and then 88 pages left.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the same for 8. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's. Now, the remaining 88 pages are from 400 to 488. Let's look at the tens place in these.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place in pages 440 to 449, which is 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place in pages 480 to 488. Wait, but 480 to 488 is only 9 pages, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0 to 8, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So, in the tens place, 4's are 10 more, and 8's are 9 more in the remaining pages.\n\nAdding that to the 40 from the complete hundreds, the total for 4's in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8's, it's 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49, so 4's are one more than 8's here.\n\nNow, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400 to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 times. Wait, no, wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for each page from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nSo, adding up all the places:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 48, 8's = 49\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n\nNow, let's total them up.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's are 187, and total 8's are 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times, and then 8 extra pages. So, 48 times 1 for 4's, and 48 times 1 for 8's. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more, making 8's in units place 49, and 4's remain at 48. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 40-49 and 80-89, so 10 times each. There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10=40 for both 4's and 8's. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, 440-449 is 10 pages with 4 in tens place, and 480-488 is 9 pages with 8 in tens place. So, 4's add 10, making 50, and 8's add 9, making 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times. 8's in hundreds place: none, so 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, 4's are printed 89 more times than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So from page 1 to page 488, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's page 4; from 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each complete set of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 48 sets would give 48 fours. But wait, I think I need to check if the last partial set includes a 4 in the units place. From 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is in there, which adds one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. So, in each 100 numbers, there are 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488. \n\nSo, for each complete hundred, 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, checking the partial hundred from 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 fours. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so maybe I need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total fours in the tens place would be 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. So, adding that to the 40 from the complete hundreds, we get 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-499. But since our book only goes up to 488, it's from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place. Similar to fours, in each set of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). So, each complete set contributes 1 eight, so 48 eights. Now, checking the partial set 481-488: the units digits are 1-8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more eight. So, total eights in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for each 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred 401-488.\n\nSo, for each complete hundred, 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, the partial hundred 401-488: the tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but the tens digit being 8 in 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each of those, so that's 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but actually, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all those numbers. So, that's 9 eights. So, adding that to the 40 from the complete hundreds, we get 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each, so that's 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49 + 49 is 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for fours, I had 188 fours, and for eights, 98 eights. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 (from the four complete hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, for fours in the tens place, I had 50. Let me check that again. For fours in the tens place, in each complete hundred, it's 10 fours, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10 fours, making 50 in total. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, each complete hundred gives 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights, making 49 in total.\n\nSo, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again for eights. From 1-488, each 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. So, 48 complete sets of 10, which is 48 eights, and then in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 488 is included, which adds one more eight. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount in the tens place. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, 80-89 is 10 times. So, for 1-100, 80-89: 10 eights.\n\nSimilarly, 101-200: 180-189: 10 eights.\n\n201-300: 280-289: 10 eights.\n\n301-400: 380-389: 10 eights.\n\nThen, 401-488: 480-488: 9 eights.\n\nSo, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the tens place:\n\n1-100: 40-49: 10 fours.\n\n101-200: 140-149: 10 fours.\n\n201-300: 240-249: 10 fours.\n\n301-400: 340-349: 10 fours.\n\n401-488: 440-449: 10 fours.\n\nSo, that's 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, I had 4 hundreds for fours, but actually, from 1-400, that's four hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40, and then 440-449 is another 10, making 50. That's correct.\n\nSo, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nEights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the hundreds place for fours was 89, but let me verify that. From 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights there.\n\nSo, total fours: 188, eights: 98. Difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. For fours, from 1-488, each 10 numbers contribute one four in the units place. So, 48 complete sets of 10, giving 48 fours, and then in 481-488, the units digit 4 appears at 484, which is one more, so 49 fours. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the units place, same logic: 48 complete sets, each contributing one eight, and then in 481-488, 488 has an eight, so 49 eights. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, I think the calculations are correct. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98, so there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times the digit appears in each position up to the given number.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n\n- Units place:\n  - For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once.\n  - Number of complete groups of 10 in 488: floor(488/10) = 48.\n  - So, 48 fours.\n  - Now, check the remainder: 488 % 10 = 8.\n  - So, from 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is included, adding one more four.\n  - Total units fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place:\n  - For every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n  - Number of complete groups of 100 in 488: floor(488/100) = 4.\n  - So, 4 * 10 = 40 fours.\n  - Now, check the remainder: 488 % 100 = 88.\n  - So, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n  - Total tens fours: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - For every 1000 numbers, 4 appears 100 times in the hundreds place (400-499).\n  - But since we're only going up to 488, it's from 400-488.\n  - Number of numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n  - So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8:\n\n- Units place:\n  - Same as above, 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8, plus 488, so 49 eights.\n\n- Tens place:\n  - For every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n  - Number of complete groups of 100: 4, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights.\n  - Remainder: 488 % 100 = 88.\n  - In the last partial hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights.\n  - Total tens eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 8 appears in the hundreds place for 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so zero eights.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes 1 '4'.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48 complete sets, contributing 48 '4's.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more '4'.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's (e.g., 40-49).\n   - 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 * 10 = 40 '4's.\n   - The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10 '4's.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers 400-488 contribute 89 '4's.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes 1 '8'.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48 complete sets, contributing 48 '8's.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) includes 488, adding 1 more '8'.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 '8's (e.g., 80-89).\n   - 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 * 10 = 40 '8's.\n   - The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 480-488, adding 9 '8's.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No numbers from 800-899 are included, so 0 '8's.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by considering how digits are counted in page numbers. Each page number is a three-digit number, right? From 1 to 488. So, I guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8, and then subtract the two totals.\n\nFirst, let me consider the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, same with 8. So, how many full sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets and then 8 extra pages. So, for the units digit, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times as well. But wait, in the extra 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in those extra pages, the units digit 8 appears once more. So, units place: 4's = 48, 8's = 49. Hmm, so 4's are one less in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, right? Each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49), and similarly for 8. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages left (401-488). So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would give 40 times for 4. Similarly, 8 would also appear 10 times per hundred, so 40 times as well. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 401-410, the tens digit is 0, 411-420 is 1, and so on up to 480-488, which is 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears once (440-449). So, total tens place: 4's = 40 + 1 = 41, and 8's = 40 + 1 (from 480-488) = 41 as well. So, both 4 and 8 appear 41 times in the tens place. That means they are equal here, so no difference.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, for pages 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's zero. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299 is 2; 300-399 is 3; 400-488 is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4 in this book, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 4's in hundreds place: 89, 8's: 0. That's a big difference.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place, and 0 times for 8.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 41\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 41 + 89 = let's calculate that. 48 + 41 is 89, plus 89 is 178.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 41\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 41 + 0 = 90.\n\nWait, so 4's total is 178, and 8's total is 90. So, how many more 4's than 8's? That would be 178 - 90 = 88.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in units. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, contributing 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, 8 appears once more, making units 4's = 48, 8's = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles 0-8. So, 4 appears once in the tens place (440-449), so 4's tens count is 41, same for 8's, as 8 appears once in 480-488. So, both 41. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 48 (units) + 41 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 48+41=89, 89+89=178.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 41 (tens) + 0 = 90.\n\nSo, 178 - 90 = 88. So, 48 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's calculate the total number of digits printed. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I should count the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10, so in 488 pages, how many times does each digit 0-9 appear? It's 48 full cycles (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488). So, for each digit 0-9, they appear 48 times in the units place. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each get one more count. So, 4 appears once more, making units 4's = 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the units place, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in the units place in this extra part, so 48 (from full cycles) +1=49. Similarly, 8 appears once in the units place in the extra, so 48+1=49 as well. Wait, that contradicts my earlier count where I thought 8's units were 49 and 4's were 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The total number of units digits is 488. Each digit from 0-9 appears floor(488/10) = 48 times. Then, the remainder is 8, so digits 1-8 each get an extra count. So, for units place:\n\n- 4 appears 48 times from the full cycles plus 1 more in the extra (484?), so total 49.\n- 8 appears 48 times plus 1 more in the extra (488), so total 49.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought before. So, in units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. Hmm, that changes things. So, earlier, I thought 4's units were 48 and 8's were 49, but now I'm getting both as 49. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the extra pages. Let me see: 488 pages, so the last page is 488. The last full set of 10 is 480, so 480 is the 48th set. Then, pages 481-488 are the remaining 8 pages. So, the units digits from 481-488 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, digits 1-8 each appear once in the units place. So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once. Therefore, in the units place, 4's count is 48 (from 480 pages) +1=49, and 8's count is 48+1=49. So, both have 49 in units place. So, my initial count was wrong; I had mistakenly thought 4's units were 48, but it's actually 49.\n\nOkay, so that changes the total counts. Let me recast everything.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\nAs before, each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles 0-8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Wait, earlier I thought it was once, but actually, it's 10 times because each page from 440 to 449 has 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 8 in the tens place appears from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 pages (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, right? So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, so let me correct that.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It's from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total tens place counts:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nWait, so that's different from before. So, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's: 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in the last partial hundred, 4 appears once, but that was a mistake. Actually, in 440-449, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages (488 - 400 +1 =89). So, 4's in hundreds place: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nSo, now, let's tally up:\n\n4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188\n\n8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nSo, 4's total:188, 8's total:98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90\n\nWait, that's a different answer. So, earlier I thought 88, but now it's 90. Hmm, where did I go wrong initially?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the tens place earlier. Let me go through it again.\n\nIn the tens place, each full hundred contributes 10 times for each digit. So, 4 hundreds give 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8 in the tens place, it's from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 4's tens:40+10=50, 8's tens:40+9=49.\n\nUnits place: as established, both 4 and 8 have 49 each.\n\nHundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the units place. So, total units digits:488 pages, each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10)=48 times. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so each of those digits gets an extra count. So, 4 appears once more, making it 49, and 8 appears once more, making it 49. So, both 4 and 8 have 49 in units place.\n\nTens place: As above, 4's tens:50, 8's tens:49.\n\nHundreds place:4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo, totals:4's=188, 8's=98, difference=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 88, but now it's 90. I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation of the tens place. So, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, how many times does it appear? For example, tens digit 0: pages 401-410, which is 10 pages. Similarly, tens digit 1:411-420, 10 pages, and so on up to tens digit 8:480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0 to 7, there are 10 pages each, and for 8, there are 9 pages. So, in the tens place in 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 4: pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 times for 4.\n- Tens digit 8: pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 times for 8.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct. So, in the last partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, the correct total for 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nCalculating 4's:\n\nUnits place: as above, 49.\n\nTens place:50.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nCalculating 8's:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the answer was 88, but now it's 90. I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the tens place, where I thought 4's tens were 41 and 8's were 41, but that was incorrect. Actually, 4's tens are 50, and 8's tens are 49, so that changes the total.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let's calculate the total number of digits printed. Each page from 1 to 9 is one digit, 10 to 99 is two digits, and 100 to 488 is three digits.\n\nSo, total digits:\n\n- Pages 1-9:9 pages *1 digit=9\n- Pages 10-99:90 pages *2 digits=180\n- Pages 100-488:389 pages *3 digits=1167\nTotal digits:9+180+1167=1356.\n\nWait, but maybe that's not necessary here. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a formula for counting digit occurrences.\n\nFor a given digit d in a certain position, the count can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times d appears = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nBut wait, that's for numbers up to n. Wait, maybe I should use a more systematic approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the standard digit counting method.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >=4 else 0) = 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: (488 //10) + (1 if (488%10)>=8 else 0)=48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place: (488 // 100)*10 + (if (488%100)>=40 then (488%100 -40 +1) else 0).\n\nWait, let's compute that.\n\n488//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\n488%100=88.\n\nSince 88 >=40, the number of 4's in the tens place is 88 -40 +1=49.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred. So, in 488 pages, the tens digit cycles 4 times fully (1-400), giving 40 times for each digit, and then in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit 4, it appears 10 times in 440-449, and for 8, it appears 9 times in 480-488.\n\nWait, so maybe the formula I used earlier isn't accurate here because it's considering the entire range, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for each digit position.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of higher digits.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the standard method for counting digit occurrences.\n\nLet me try to count the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:488//10=48.\n\nEach group contributes 1 four, so 48.\n\nThen, check the remainder:488%10=8.\n\nIf the remainder >=4, add 1 more. Since 8>=4, add 1. So total 4's in units:48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place:\n\n488//10=48, each contributes 1 eight, so 48.\n\nRemainder=8.\n\nIf remainder >=8, add 1. Since 8>=8, add 1. So total 8's in units:48+1=49.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100:488//100=4.\n\nEach group contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, look at the remainder:488%100=88.\n\nNow, how many fours in the tens place in the last partial group:\n\nThe tens digit is 4 for numbers from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. Since 449 < 488, all 10 are included. So, add 10.\n\nThus, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in tens place:\n\nComplete groups of 100:4, each contributes 10 eights in tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nRemainder=88.\n\nHow many eights in the tens place in the last partial group:\n\nThe tens digit is 8 for numbers from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, add 9.\n\nThus, total 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's in hundreds place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 1000:0, since 488<1000.\n\nBut, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89 fours in hundreds place.\n\nNumber of 8's in hundreds place:\n\nSince 488<800, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 88, but that was due to a miscalculation in the tens place. So, the correct answer is 90.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough times, so I'm confident the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place from pages 1 to 480.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more '4' and one more '8' in the units place.\n   - Total '4's in units: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's in units: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. Four full hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 '4's (440-449) and 9 '8's (480-488).\n   - Total '4's in tens: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's in tens: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, totaling 89 times.\n   - The digit '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total '4's in hundreds: 89.\n   - Total '8's in hundreds: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of each digit in the units and tens places separately.\n\nFirst, I know that each page number is printed once, starting from 1 and ending at 488. So, I'm dealing with numbers from 1 to 488. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in these numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference between these two counts.\n\nI think it's easier to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Let's start with the units place.\n\n**Counting 4's and 8's in the units place:**\n\nFor the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers, except possibly for the last few numbers if the total isn't a multiple of 10. Since 488 is the last page, let me see how many complete groups of 10 there are.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. The number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 48 * 10 = 480), and then 8 more numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each group of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0-9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for the 48 complete groups, each digit appears 48 times in the units place. That means the digit 4 appears 48 times, and the digit 8 appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nNow, looking at the last 8 numbers: 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial group, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake because 488 is included, but let me check.\n\nWait, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place? Let me think again. Each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, same count.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so maybe I should consider that the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, but 488 is the 8th number. So, yes, 481 (1), 482 (2), ..., 488 (8). So, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once. So, my initial calculation seems correct.\n\n**Counting 4's and 8's in the tens place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. \n\nFrom 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times, so for each digit, it appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. So, for 4 hundreds, each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. \n\nWait, but let me check: from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 times each digit in the tens place.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 numbers: 401-488. Let's break this down. The tens digit in 401-488 goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490). But wait, 488 is the end, so from 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but only 8 numbers (481-488). So, the tens digit for 401-488 is:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8, appearing 8 times.\n\nSo, in the 401-488 range, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nDigits 0-7 each appear 10 times in their respective decades, and digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 10 times in 441-450.\n- Digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 4 (from the hundreds) *10=40 plus 10 (from 441-450). Wait, no, wait: in the hundreds, each digit appears 40 times, right? Because 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times per digit in the tens place. So, for digit 4 in the tens place, from the hundreds, it's 4*10=40 times. Then, in 401-488, digit 4 appears 10 times in 441-450. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place: from the hundreds, it's 4*10=40 times. Then, in 401-488, digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 1-400, the tens digit 8 appears 40 times (4 times 10). Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total 40 + 8 = 48 times.\n\nWait, but in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, yes, 48 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 48\n\nSo, difference in tens place: 50 - 48 = +2.\n\n**Counting 4's and 8's in the hundreds place:**\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488.\n\nWait, no, let's see:\n\n- 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since they're two-digit numbers), but page numbers start at 1, so maybe we should consider 1-99 as 0 in the hundreds place, but actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nWait, but in terms of page numbers, page 1 is just '1', so it's a single digit. Pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit. So, the hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- Digit 0: 1-99 (99 numbers)\n- Digit 1: 100-199 (100 numbers)\n- Digit 2: 200-299 (100 numbers)\n- Digit 3: 300-399 (100 numbers)\n- Digit 4: 400-488 (89 numbers)\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488)\n- Digit 8 appears 0 times because there's no page 800-899; the book ends at 488.\n\nWait, but 8's in the hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, difference in hundreds place: 89 - 0 = +89.\n\n**Total counts:**\n\nNow, let's add up the counts from each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 48\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, let me check the addition:\n\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nFor 8's: 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me confirm:\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, I had 50, and for 8's, 48.\n\nUnits place: both 49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check again.\n\nWait, another way: perhaps I can count the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me think again.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, with 481-488 having tens digit 8.\n\nSo, for 4's in the tens place:\n\n- From 1-400: 40 times\n- From 401-488: 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times\nTotal: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n\n- From 1-400: 40 times\n- From 401-488: 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times\nTotal: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Each digit appears 49 times, as calculated earlier.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 times\n- 8's: 0 times\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut let me just think again: is there a possibility that I double-counted or missed something?\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference.\n\nLet's try that.\n\n**Calculating total number of 4's:**\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Calculating total number of 8's:**\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised because 91 seems like a large number. Let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nSuppose we have a book with 20 pages. Let's count the 4's and 8's.\n\nPage numbers: 1-20.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4 and 14 \u2192 2 times.\n- Tens place: 40-49, but we only go up to 20, so 0 times.\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\nTotal 4's: 2.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8 and 18 \u2192 2 times.\n- Tens place: 0 times.\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\nTotal 8's: 2.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nWait, but according to my method, let's see:\n\nUnits place: 20 / 10 = 2 complete groups, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. So, 2 + 0 (since 20 is exact, no partial group). So, units: 2 each.\n\nTens place: 20 / 100 = 0 complete hundreds, so 0 times each. Then, in 1-20, the tens digits go from 0 (1-9) and 1 (10-19). So, 4 in tens place: 0 times, 8 in tens place: 0 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0 times each.\n\nSo, total 4's: 2, 8's: 2. Difference: 0.\n\nWhich is correct, as in 1-20, 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nAnother test: 30 pages.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units: 4,14,24 \u2192 3 times.\n- Tens: 40-49 not present, so 0.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 3.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units: 8,18,28 \u2192 3 times.\n- Tens: 0.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 3.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits: 30 /10=3, so 3 each.\n\nTens: 30 /100=0, so 0 each.\n\nHundreds: 0 each.\n\nTotal: 3 each. Correct.\n\nAnother test: 48 pages.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits: 4,14,24,34,44 \u2192 5 times.\n\nTens: 40-49: 40-44,45-48. Wait, 40-49 is 10 numbers, but we only go up to 48. So, in tens place, 40-48: tens digit 4 appears 9 times (40-48). Wait, no, 40-48 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 for all of them, so 9 times.\n\nWait, no, wait: 40-48 is 9 numbers, each with tens digit 4. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 5 (units) + 9 (tens) =14.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits: 8,18,28,38,48 \u21925 times.\n\nTens: 40-48: tens digit 4, so 8 in tens place only if there were 80-89, but we only go up to 48, so 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's:5.\n\nDifference:14-5=9.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits:\n\n48 /10=4 complete groups, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. So, 4 each. Then, in the partial group (41-48), units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (44) and 8 appears once (48). So, units:4+1=5, 8's:4+1=5.\n\nTens:\n\n48 /100=0 complete hundreds. Then, in 1-48, the tens digits go up to 4 (40-48). So, in tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 9 times (40-48)\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens:9, 8's:0.\n\nHundreds:0 each.\n\nTotal 4's:5+9=14.\n\nTotal 8's:5+0=5.\n\nDifference:14-5=9.\n\nWhich matches the manual count. So, my method works.\n\nTherefore, back to the original problem, the difference is 91.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem, the book has 488 pages. So, the difference is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just think again: when I calculated the hundreds place, I had 89 4's and 0 8's, which makes sense because the book ends at 488, so 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with hundreds digit 4.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, after carefully going through each digit place and counting, I'm confident that the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n### Counting 4's and 8's in the units place:\n- Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n- In the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 to 8, so 4 and 8 each appear once.\n- Total 4's in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n- Total 8's in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n\n### Counting 4's and 8's in the tens place:\n- Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For 4 hundreds, each digit appears 40 times.\n- In the range 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n- Total 4's in tens place: \\(40 + 10 = 50\\)\n- Total 8's in tens place: \\(40 + 8 = 48\\)\n\n### Counting 4's and 8's in the hundreds place:\n- The hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- The hundreds digit 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n- Total 4's in hundreds place: 89\n- Total 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\n### Total counts:\n- Total 4's: \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\)\n- Total 8's: \\(49 + 48 + 0 = 97\\)\n\n### Difference:\n- Difference: \\(188 - 97 = 91\\)\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\(\\boxed{91}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured. Each page number is just a number from 1 to 488, right? So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many times each digit appears in each place: units, tens, hundreds, etc. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits. So, I should consider the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll count how many times 4 appears in the units place, then in the tens place, and then in the hundreds place. I'll do the same for the digit 8 and then compare the totals.\n\nStarting with the units place for 4: In every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. Each full set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNow, for the tens place for 4: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit for numbers less than 100 is 0, but page 1 is just 1, so maybe I should adjust for that.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 1 to 488. Each time the tens digit is 4, it contributes 10 numbers where the units digit varies from 0 to 9. So, how many such blocks are there?\n\nThe blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, does the last block go up to 349? Since 488 is beyond 349, so yes, we have four complete blocks. So, 40 times 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, 340-349 is the fourth block, and 349 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 40 occurrences.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place for 4: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 40 = 88, plus 89 is 177. So, 177 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with units place for 8: Similar to 4's, in every set of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? 48 full sets (480 numbers) plus 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each full set contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in the units place (at 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place for 8: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: yes, that's within 488.\n- 180-189: yes.\n- 280-289: yes.\n- 380-389: yes.\n\nSo, four blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but wait, does 380-389 fall within 488? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So, that's four blocks, so 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8, so that's one more, making 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: four blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place: none, since 488 is less than 800. So, total 89 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 89 8's, but let me check again.\n\nWait, units place: 49, tens place: 40, so 49 + 40 = 89. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when calculating 4's, I had 177 4's, and 89 8's. So, the difference would be 177 - 89 = 88.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 times.\n\nTens place: 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 40 + 89 = 177.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in 481-488, 488 has an 8, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 40.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 40 = 89.\n\nSo, 177 - 89 = 88.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me think again. Is there a possibility I'm overcounting?\n\nWait, maybe I should consider whether the page numbers go up to 488, so in the hundreds place for 4's, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each block is 10 numbers, so 4 blocks give 40. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, plus in the last 8 numbers, 488, which doesn't have a 4 in the units place. So, 48.\n\nWait, but 488 is page 488, so the units digit is 8, so no 4 there. So, 48 units place 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then in the last 8 numbers, 488 has an 8, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40.\n\nSo, 89 8's.\n\nSo, 177 4's minus 89 8's is 88 more 4's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can use a formula or a different counting method to verify.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, we can calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nFor units place:\n\nFor digit d in units place, the number of times it appears from 1 to n is floor((n + 1) / 10) if d \u2260 0, else floor(n / 10). But since we're dealing with digits 4 and 8, which are non-zero, it's floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48.9, so 48 times for each digit in units place. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier count where 8's had 49. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is slightly different. Let me think. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nIf n >= d, then floor(n / 10) + 1 if the units digit of n is >= d, else floor(n / 10).\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place is:\n\nnumber_of_times = (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nSo, for d=4, n=488:\n\n488 // 10 = 48\n\n488 % 10 = 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1 =49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place for 4's was 48. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me test this formula.\n\nWait, for example, from 1 to 10, digit 4 appears once in the units place (at 4). Using the formula:\n\nn=10.\n\nn//10=1\n\nn%10=0, which is <4, so 1 + 0=1, correct.\n\nFrom 1 to 14:\n\nn=14\n\nn//10=1\n\nn%10=4, which is >=4, so 1 +1=2. But in reality, from 1-14, 4 appears at 4 and 14, so 2 times. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=488:\n\nn//10=48\n\nn%10=8 >=4, so 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, so that would mean digit 4 appears 49 times in the units place from 1-488. But earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in my initial count, I thought that in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear. But according to the formula, digit 4 appears 49 times in the units place, which would mean that in the last partial set, it does appear once. But 488 ends with 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place in 481-488 except perhaps at 484? Wait, 484 is within 481-488, so yes, 484 has a 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, so my initial count was wrong. I thought that in the last 8 numbers, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once at 484. So, units place for 4's should be 48 +1=49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, using the same formula:\n\nn=488\n\nn//10=48\n\nn%10=8 >=8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSo, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial count where I thought 4's units place was 48 and 8's was 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me correct that.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\n4's: 49\n\n8's: 49\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nFor the tens place, the formula is a bit different. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n can be calculated as:\n\nnumber_of_times = (n // 100) * 10\n\nplus, if the last two digits of n are >= d*10, then add (last_two_digits - d*10 + 1), else add 0.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to think in terms of higher digits.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit d in the tens place, the number of times it appears is:\n\nFor each hundred block, d appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 0-99, d=4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, etc.\n\nSo, for digit d in tens place:\n\nnumber_of_times = (n // 100) * 10\n\nplus, if the last two digits of n are >= d*10, then add (last_two_digits - d*10 + 1), else 0.\n\nSo, for n=488, last two digits are 88.\n\nFor d=4:\n\nn//100=4\n\nSo, 4*10=40\n\nNow, last two digits=88 >=40, so add (88 -40 +1)=49\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 40-49 is 10 numbers, so in the last partial hundred, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nnumber_of_times = (n // 100) * 10\n\nplus, if the tens digit of n is > d, then add 10, else if it's equal, add (units digit +1), else 0.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, for the tens place:\n\nFor d=4, how many times does it appear in the tens place from 1 to 488?\n\nEach time the tens digit is 4, which happens in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another block.\n\nWait, so how many blocks are there?\n\nFrom 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers\n\n100-199:140-149:10\n\n200-299:240-249:10\n\n300-399:340-349:10\n\n400-488:440-449:10\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10.\n\nSo, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 4 blocks, giving 40. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, let's list them:\n\n1. 40-49: 10 numbers\n2. 140-149:10\n3. 240-249:10\n4. 340-349:10\n5. 440-449:10\n\nSo, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 blocks, but now I see 5 blocks. So, that changes the count.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in the tens place:\n\nBlocks would be 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489.\n\nBut since n=488, 480-488 is part of the last block. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach block contributes 10, except the last one, which contributes 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, for d=8 in tens place:\n\n1. 80-89:10\n2. 180-189:10\n3. 280-289:10\n4. 380-389:10\n5. 480-488:9\n\nSo, total 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, so for d=4 in tens place: 50\n\nd=8 in tens place:49\n\nHmm, that's different from my initial count.\n\nWait, so let's correct that.\n\nFor 4's in tens place:50\n\nFor 8's in tens place:49\n\nNow, for the hundreds place.\n\nFor d=4 in hundreds place: numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor d=8 in hundreds place: numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, now, let's recalculate the totals.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99, plus 89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but that's different from my initial count. So, where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in counting the number of blocks for the tens place. Initially, I thought there were 4 blocks for 4's in the tens place, but actually, there are 5 blocks, including 440-449.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, there are 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 49 instead of 50.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nFor 4's in tens place:\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nTotal:5*10=50.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nTotal:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, now, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the answer would be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut earlier I thought it was 88, but that was due to an incorrect count of the tens place for 4's.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the units place.\n\nWait, using the formula, for units place:\n\nFor d=4:\n\nnumber_of_times = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10 >=4) else 0)\n\n488//10=48\n\n488%10=8 >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nnumber_of_times =48 +1=49.\n\nSo, units place:49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor d=4:\n\nnumber_of_times = (488 // 100)*10 + (if (488 % 100) >=40, then (488%100 -40 +1), else 0)\n\n488//100=4\n\n4*10=40\n\n488%100=88 >=40, so 88-40+1=49.\n\nSo, 40+49=89? Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 50.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the formula is different.\n\nWait, maybe the formula for the tens place is:\n\nFor each hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488, which is 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here?\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is fully included, so that's 10 numbers. So, in the last partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nThus, total for tens place:4*10 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the last partial hundred, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nThus, total for tens place:4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, that aligns with my earlier count.\n\nThus, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut earlier, when I first calculated, I thought it was 88, but that was because I didn't account for the 440-449 block correctly.\n\nWait, let me confirm once more.\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's:49\n\n8's:49\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:50\n\n8's:49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89\n\n8's:0\n\nSo, totals:\n\n4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** In every set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 and an additional 8 numbers (481-488). Since 488 ends with 8, 4 appears once more in the units place at 484. Total: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once in the units place per set of 10. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets and an additional 8 numbers where 8 appears once at 488. Total: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9 (since 488 is the end). Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488. Total: 0 times.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately, like units, tens, and hundreds, and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFirst, I should note that the pages go from 1 to 488. So, we're dealing with three-digit numbers, right? Wait, no, actually, pages 1 through 9 are single-digit, 10 through 99 are two-digit, and 100 through 488 are three-digit. But maybe it's easier to think of all pages as three-digit numbers by padding with leading zeros, so page 1 would be 001, page 10 would be 010, and so on. That might make it easier to count the digits in each place.\n\nSo, if I consider each page as a three-digit number, the digits are in the hundreds, tens, and units places. I'll need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each of these places separately and then sum them up.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's and 8's in the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 pages. So, in every 10 pages, each digit appears once. Since the book has 488 pages, there are 48 full blocks of 10 pages (because 48*10=480) and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). \n\nWait, but actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades and then 8 pages in the 49th decade. But maybe a better way is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the units place.\n\nFor the units place, the number of times a digit d appears is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is floor(488 / 10) = 48 times, plus one more if the last page is beyond the digit d. Wait, no, actually, for each digit, the count in the units place is (number of complete decades) * 1 + (if the last digit is >= d, then 1 else 0). Wait, maybe that's not quite right.\n\nWait, let me think again. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 48 times in the first 480 pages because 480 / 10 = 48. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, for digits 1 to 8, they each appear once more in the units place, and digits 9 and 0 don't appear in this last partial decade.\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from the complete decades) plus 1 (since 484 is within 481-488), making it 49. Similarly, the number of 8's is 48 plus 1, making it 49 as well. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so in the units place, 8 appears once more, but 4 appears once as well. So, both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check that. From 1 to 480, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, digits 1 through 8 each appear once more. Therefore, 4 appears once more, so total 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8 appears once more, so 48 +1 =49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times each digit appears in the tens place. Now, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let's see: pages 401-410 have tens digit 0, 411-420 have 1, and so on up to 481-490 having 8, but since we only go up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 pages with tens digit 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times (since we only go up to 488). Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, from 401 to 488, that's 88 pages. The tens digits cycle every 10 pages. So, from 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n411-420: 1 (10)\n421-430:2 (10)\n431-440:3 (10)\n441-450:4 (10)\n451-460:5 (10)\n461-470:6 (10)\n471-480:7 (10)\n481-490:8 (10)\n\nBut since we're only going up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears only 8 times in this partial group, not 10.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages, each digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total occurrences in the tens place:\n- For digits 0-7: 4*10 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50 times each.\n- For digit 8: 4*10 (from full hundreds) + 8 (from partial) = 48 times.\n- For digit 9: 4*10 = 40 times, since there's no 490-499 pages.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, in the full hundreds, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 times each for digits 0-9 in the tens place.\n\nThen, in the remaining 88 pages, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 8 times. So, adding to the 40, digits 0-7 get 40 +10=50 each, digit 8 gets 40 +8=48, and digits 9 remains at 40.\n\nWait, but wait, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digits go up to 8, so 9 doesn't appear in the tens place at all beyond the full hundreds.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n- Number of 4's: 50 (since 4 is among 0-7)\n- Number of 8's: 48 (since 8 appears 8 times in the partial group plus 40 from full hundreds)\n\nWait, but 4 is among 0-7, so in the partial group, 4 appears 10 times, right? Because 441-450 would be the group where tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages. So, yes, 4 appears 10 times in the partial group.\n\nWait, but 441-450 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n- 4's: 40 (from full hundreds) +10 (from partial) =50\n- 8's: 40 (from full hundreds) +8 (from partial) =48\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 0: pages 1-99: 99 pages, so hundreds digit is 0, but since we're considering three-digit numbers, maybe it's 99 times? Wait, but when we consider leading zeros, page 1 is 001, so the hundreds digit is 0, and it's 0 for all pages 1-99. So, 99 times.\n\n- 1: 100-199: 100 pages, so hundreds digit is 1, 100 times.\n\n- 2: 200-299: 100 times.\n\n- 3: 300-399: 100 times.\n\n- 4: 400-488: 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, hundreds digit is 4, 89 times.\n\nDigits 5-9: 0 times, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89 times\n- 8's: 0 times\n\nWait, but 8's don't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, which is in the 400s, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89 = let's see, 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49 +48=97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. Therefore, the difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8, which seems correct because from 1-480, each digit appears 48 times, and then from 481-488, 4 and 8 each appear once more, so 48+1=49.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, I had 50, which is 40 from the full hundreds and 10 from the partial group (441-450). For 8's, I had 48, which is 40 from the full hundreds and 8 from the partial group (481-488). That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times (400-488), and 8's don't appear at all. So, 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? Because pages 1-99 have hundreds digit 0, which is 99 pages, but when considering leading zeros, it's 001 to 099, so the hundreds digit is 0 for 99 pages. Then, 100-199:100 pages, hundreds digit 1. 200-299:100, 300-399:100, 400-488:89 pages.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but 488-400+1=89, yes.\n\nSo, 4's in hundreds place:89\n\n8's in hundreds place:0\n\nSo, the counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check again because 91 seems like a lot. Let me recount each digit's occurrence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check that.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear?\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 080-089, 180-189, etc.), so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 pages (480-488), so 8 occurrences. Therefore, total 40+8=48 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the tens place, from 1-400, 4*10=40, and from 401-488, 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 occurrences, making total 50.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the first 480 pages.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the first 400 pages.\n   - Pages 401-488:\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449)\n     - 8 appears 8 times (480-488)\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n   - 8 does not appear.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference**: 188 - 97 = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"
