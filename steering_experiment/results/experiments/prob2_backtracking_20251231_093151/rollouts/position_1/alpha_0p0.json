    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Because the number of times a digit appears can vary depending on its position. So, I'll start by looking at the units place, then the tens place, and finally the hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, right? Like pages 4, 14, 24, etc. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once every 10 pages in the units place, like 8, 18, 28, etc. So, in 488 pages, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. So, for the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times plus one more time in the 484th page, right? Wait, no, because 484 is within the 481-490 range, which is part of the 480 pages. Wait, actually, no, because 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 pages) and then 8 more pages. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times (once every 10 pages) and then in the 484th page, which is 484, the units digit is 4. So that's 49 times for 4. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times in the units place (like 8, 18, ..., 478) and then in the 488th page, which is 488, the units digit is 8. So that's 49 times for 8 as well. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit for 8 in the 488th page is included, making it 49 times for 8. So, units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference in units place is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for pages 80-89, another 10 times. So, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds and then 88 pages. \n\nSo, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8. Now, we have 88 extra pages beyond 400. Let's see how the tens digit behaves here. Pages 401-488. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, ..., up to 8 for 480-488. \n\nSo, in the 88 extra pages beyond 400, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, from 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages. Similarly, how about 8? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place beyond the 400 mark, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nAdding that to the previous 40 times each, we get for the tens place: 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, right? Because the book has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 onwards. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From page 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. The difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, adding up the differences from each place:\n- Units place: 0\n- Tens place: +1\n- Hundreds place: +89\n\nTotal difference = 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recount the tens place beyond 400. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For the tens digit being 4, it's pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. For the tens digit being 8, it's pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, yes, 10 vs 9, so 4 appears once more in the tens place beyond the 400 mark. So, that's correct.\n\nAlso, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up the differences: units (0) + tens (1) + hundreds (89) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets (480 pages) + 8 extra pages.\n   - 4 appears 48 times in the units place (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 474) and once more in 484, totaling 49 times.\n   - 8 appears 48 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 478) and once in 488, totaling 49 times.\n   - Difference in units place: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 488 pages have 4 full hundreds (400 pages) and 88 extra pages.\n   - In 400 pages: 4 appears 40 times (4*10), 8 appears 40 times.\n   - In 88 extra pages (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total for tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n   - Difference in tens place: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference in hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nSumming the differences:\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\nTotal difference = 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the structure of page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I'll need to analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI'll handle each digit place one by one, starting with the units place, then the tens, and finally the hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit (like 4 or 8) appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and considering any remainder.\n\nBut wait, since 488 is not a multiple of 10, I need to adjust for the last partial block. Let me think. The total number of complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages is 48 (since 48 * 10 = 480), and then there are 8 more pages (481 to 488).\n\nSo, for the units place:\n- The number of times 4 appears is 48 (from the complete blocks) plus 1 (since 484 is within the last 8 pages). So, 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n- Similarly, the number of times 8 appears is 48 (from the complete blocks) plus 1 (since 488 is within the last 8 pages). So, 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. In each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, same with 8. So, for 48 complete blocks, that's 48 times each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, yes, 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, the digits cycle every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each block of 100. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each digit, it appears 10 times per 100 pages.\n\nAgain, considering 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 88 more pages (400-488).\n\nSo, for each digit in the tens place:\n- In each complete hundred, the digit appears 10 times.\n- In the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for each digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\nWait, actually, from 400 to 488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n- 400-409: tens digit is 0 (10 times)\n- 410-419: tens digit is 1 (10 times)\n- 420-429: tens digit is 2 (10 times)\n- 430-439: tens digit is 3 (10 times)\n- 440-449: tens digit is 4 (10 times)\n- 450-459: tens digit is 5 (10 times)\n- 460-469: tens digit is 6 (10 times)\n- 470-479: tens digit is 7 (10 times)\n- 480-488: tens digit is 8 (9 times, since it's only 9 numbers: 480-488)\n\nWait, no, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this last partial block.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n- The number of times 4 appears is in each complete hundred, 10 times, and in the last partial block, 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total for 4 is 4 complete hundreds * 10 + 10 = 50 times.\n- Similarly, the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is in each complete hundred, 10 times, and in the last partial block, 9 times. So, total for 8 is 4*10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Each complete hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would be 4*10 = 40 times for each digit. Then, in the last 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8, with the last one being 8 for 9 pages (480-488). So, for 4, in the tens place, it's from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8, it's 9 times. So, total for 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digits change every 100 numbers. So, for page numbers 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (but since we don't print leading zeros, it's not printed). From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, 200-299 it's 2, 300-399 it's 3, and 400-488 it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- For 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, not printed, so 0 times.\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times.\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, appearing 100 times.\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, appearing 100 times.\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n- The digit 4 appears 89 times.\n- The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, for hundreds place:\n- 4: 89 times\n- 8: 0 times\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nNow for the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's are printed, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's:\n\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 '4' and 1 '8' in the units place, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 48 +1 =49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each complete hundred contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last partial block (400-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8. For 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's. For 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 '8's. So, total for 4 is 40 +10=50, and for 8 is 40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188\n8's:49 +49 +0=98\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Complete blocks: 48 (480 pages) \u2192 48 each.\n   - Last 8 pages (481-488) \u2192 1 each.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete blocks: 4 (400 pages) \u2192 40 each.\n   - Last 88 pages (400-488) \u2192 10 for 4, 9 for 8.\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately\u2014like the units place and the tens place\u2014because the number of times a digit appears can depend on its position. So, I'll probably need to calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in the units place, how many times it appears in the tens place, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from page 1 to page 488, how many such groups are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten and then an extra 8 pages. In each of those 48 groups, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial group (pages 481-488), the units digit 4 appears once on page 484. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, for each ten, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full tens and 8 extra pages. So, 48 times 1 for each full ten, which is 48, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 4 is on page 484, so that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, for the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten pages. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten pages. Similarly, this happens every hundred pages. So, in the first hundred pages (1-100), the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Then, in the next hundred (101-200), the same thing happens: 140-149, which is another 10 times. Similarly, in 201-300, it's 240-249, another 10. And in 301-400, it's 340-349, another 10. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 times. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is within that range, and 449 is also within. So, that's another 10 times.\n\nSo, let me count: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 times. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's correct, 50 times total for the tens place.\n\nSo, total 4's would be units place (49) plus tens place (50) = 99.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages each. So, in 1-100: 40-49, 10 times.\n\n101-200: 140-149, 10 times.\n\n201-300: 240-249, 10 times.\n\n301-400: 340-349, 10 times.\n\n401-488: 440-449, 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's another 10.\n\nSo, 4 times 10 in the first 400 pages, which is 40, and then another 10 in 401-488, making it 50. So, yes, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99 total 4's.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, in each group of ten pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many full tens are there? 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial group, pages 481-488, the units digit 8 is on page 488, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, for the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten pages. So, in each hundred, from 80-89, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages. So, let's see how many times this happens in 1-488.\n\nIn 1-100: 80-89, 10 times.\n\n101-200: 180-189, 10 times.\n\n201-300: 280-289, 10 times.\n\n301-400: 380-389, 10 times.\n\n401-488: 480-489, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages, not 10. So, in this case, the tens digit 8 appears only 9 times in the last block.\n\nSo, let's calculate: 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place 8's: 49.\n\nSo, total 8's would be units place (49) + tens place (49) = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure. For the tens place, each hundred has 10 occurrences except the last one, which only has 9. So, 4 hundreds would have 10 each, and the fifth hundred (401-500) only has 9. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 401-488, so 480-488 is 9 pages. So, yes, 49 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 99, total 8's are 98. So, 99 - 98 = 1.\n\nWait, that seems too small. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus in the last partial ten (481-488), 484 has a 4, so 1 more. So, 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 is another 10, so 50 total. So, 50.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 = 99.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus in the last partial ten (481-488), 488 has an 8, so 1 more. So, 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 99 - 98 = 1. So, there's one more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's correct, but let me think again. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 4's, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nFor 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times, correct.\n\nSo, yes, 99 4's and 98 8's. So, the difference is 1.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe there would be more, but maybe it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the hundreds place as well, but since we're dealing with a 488-page book, the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, and 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book doesn't have 800 pages. So, the hundreds place doesn't contribute any 8's, and only contributes 4's in 400-488, but that's in the hundreds place, which we didn't count yet.\n\nWait, did I miss the hundreds place for 4's? Let me check.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400-488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so that's 89 times. Wait, but I didn't count that earlier. Oh no, I think I made a mistake.\n\nWait, earlier, I only counted the tens and units places, but I didn't consider the hundreds place. So, for the digit 4, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 times. So, I completely missed that in my earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8, the hundreds digit never appears because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 0,1,2,3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, that changes things. Let me recalculate.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 50 times.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that's a lot more than before. I must have missed the hundreds place earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 49 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, now, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I had missed the hundreds place earlier, which significantly increases the count of 4's.\n\nLet me go through this again more carefully.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: As before, 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 50 times.\n\n- Hundreds place: From page 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 49 times.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct now. So, I had missed the hundreds place initially, which changes the total count.\n\nLet me confirm each part again.\n\nUnits place for 4's:\n\nFrom 1-488, every ten pages, the units digit 4 appears once. So, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), 484 has a 4, so 1 more. Total: 49.\n\nTens place for 4's:\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears for 10 pages: 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nFrom 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 pages. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place for 4's:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nUnits place for 8's:\n\nSame as for 4's: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus in the last partial ten, 488 has an 8, so 1 more. Total: 49.\n\nTens place for 8's:\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears for 10 pages: 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nFrom 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). So, 9 times.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**For the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 pages. From 1-488, there are 48 full groups of ten and one partial group (481-488). Thus, 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred contributes 10 times, and in 401-488, 440-449 adds another 10. Total: 4*10 + 10 = 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**For the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 pages. From 1-488, 48 full groups and one partial group. Total: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred contributes 10 times, and in 401-488, 480-488 contributes 9 times. Total: 4*10 + 9 = 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 never appears as the hundreds digit in 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I think I should start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place.\n\nFirst, page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, each page has a number, and each number can be one, two, or three digits long. I guess I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For every 10 consecutive pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. But wait, in the range from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages and then 8 more pages. So, in each complete set, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. Therefore, for 48 sets, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48, and the same for 8's. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 8 appears once. So, the total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. That means they are equal here, so no difference yet.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each 100-page block, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. Therefore, both 4 and 8 would each appear 10 times in the tens place per 100 pages.\n\nNow, how many complete 100-page blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of these 4 complete blocks, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, that's 4*10 = 40 times each. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digits go like this:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but from 481-488, that's 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, which is 8 times, not 10. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the block 441-450, which is 10 times, and the digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. Therefore, in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, adding up, for the tens place: 4 appears 4*10 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 4*10 + 8 = 48 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. That gives 4 being ahead by 2 in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Each 100-page block contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 40 for both. Then, in the last partial block, 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, yes, 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +8=48 for 8. So, 50 vs. 48, so 4 is ahead by 2 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it only starts appearing from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're only considering printed page numbers, maybe 0 isn't printed, so the hundreds digit doesn't exist for pages 1-99. So, starting from page 100, the hundreds digit becomes 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nIn this case, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book has 488 pages. So, let's see how many times each hundreds digit appears.\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (not printed)\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1 (appears 100 times)\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2 (appears 100 times)\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3 (appears 100 times)\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4 (appears 89 times, because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n\nWait, actually, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times. How about 8? Well, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, that's a difference of 89 in favor of 4.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages, so yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's compute that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- For each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. There are 48 full sets of 10 in 480 pages, giving 48 each. Then, from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 48 +1 = 49 for both. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each 100 pages, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. 4 blocks of 100 give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450 (10 times), and 8 appears in 481-488 (8 times). So, 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +8=48 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me think again if I counted correctly in each place.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, in 401-488, 441-450 is 10 pages, so 10 times for 4. 481-488 is 8 pages, so 8 times for 8. So, 10 and 8, which adds to 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+8=48 for 8. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1 for 4 and 8, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 48+1=49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 97, difference is 91.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\" So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just check again, because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach for each digit place.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 pages, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So, total 48 +1=49.\n\nSame for 8: 48 times in the first 480 pages, and once at 488, so 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial 100 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: 4*10=40 in the first 400 pages. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, 40 +8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. That makes sense because the number of times a digit appears in each place can be calculated independently, and then I can sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 each appear once in the units place. So, from page 1 to page 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, I think it's 48 complete sets, and then an extra 8 pages (from 481 to 488). \n\nWait, no, actually, 488 is the last page, so the total number of pages is 488. So, the number of complete sets of 10 is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more pages (481-488). \n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, I have those extra 8 pages: 481-488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in these extra pages, the units digit 8 appears once (page 488), and the digit 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, for the units place, total 4's are 48 and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, in units place, 4's are 48, 8's are 49. So, 8's are more by 1. Hmm, but wait, let me check that again. \n\nWait, no, actually, in the units place, from 1 to 488, the digit 4 appears 48 times in each set of 10, and since there are 48 full sets, that's 48*1=48. But the last partial set from 481-488 has units digits 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in units place is 48. For 8's, in each full set, it's 48, and in the partial set, 8 appears once (page 488), so total 8's in units place is 48 +1=49. So, in units place, 8's are more by 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 pages. So, for example, in 1-100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly for 8 (80-89). \n\nNow, the total number of pages is 488, which is 4*100 + 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 for 4's and 4*10=40 for 8's.\n\nNow, looking at the last partial hundred, 401-488. The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in the 440-449 range, the tens digit is 4, so that's 10 times. Similarly, for 8, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). Wait, no, from 480 to 489 is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but actually, in the tens place for 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, how many times does it appear? For example, 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 times. 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 times, and so on up to 480-488: tens digit 8, 9 times because it's only 9 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place for the last partial hundred (401-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and the digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo, total for tens place: 4's are 40 (from the first 4 hundreds) +10=50, and 8's are 40 (from first 4 hundreds) +9=49. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 49, so 4's are more by 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit in a 3-digit number is the third digit from the right. So, in 1-99, there's no hundreds digit, so we can ignore that. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, 200-299 it's 2, 300-399 it's 3, and 400-488 it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 3-digit number, the hundreds digit can't be 8 unless the number is 800 or above. But since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times. So, 4's are more by 89 here.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts from each place.\n\nFor units place:\n- 4's: 48\n- 8's: 49\nDifference: 8's are more by 1.\n\nFor tens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\nDifference: 4's are more by 1.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\nDifference: 4's are more by 89.\n\nNow, adding up the differences:\n- Units: 8's lead by 1\n- Tens: 4's lead by 1\n- Hundreds: 4's lead by 89\n\nSo, total difference: (8's lead by 1 in units) + (4's lead by 1 in tens) + (4's lead by 89 in hundreds) = (1) + (1) + (89) = 91, but since in units 8's are more, that's a negative for 4's. Wait, no, I think I should calculate the total count for 4's and 8's across all places and then find the difference.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach by considering the difference per place. Maybe it's better to calculate the total number of 4's and 8's across all digit places and then subtract.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\nWait, that's a positive number, meaning there are 89 more 4's than 8's. But let me double-check my calculations because earlier, when I was looking at each place, the difference per place added up to 91, but now it's 89. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in one of the steps.\n\nWait, let's go back and check each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\nFrom 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? Each 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear. So, total 4's in units: 48.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages, 488 has units digit 8, so that's one more. So, total 8's in units: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\nFrom 1-488, how many 4's in tens place? Each hundred has 10 pages where tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449). So, total 4's in tens: 40 +10=50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: Each hundred has 10 pages where tens digit is 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages (480-488). So, total 8's in tens: 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n4's: From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\n8's: Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference: 187 -98=89.\n\nSo, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was looking at each place's difference, I thought the total difference was 91, but that must have been a miscalculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the direction of the difference. Let me recast it:\n\nUnits place: 4's=48, 8's=49. So, 8's are more by 1.\n\nTens place: 4's=50, 8's=49. So, 4's are more by 1.\n\nHundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0. So, 4's are more by 89.\n\nSo, total difference: (4's lead by 1 in tens) + (4's lead by 89 in hundreds) - (8's lead by 1 in units) = 1 +89 -1=89.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the total difference is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just cross-verify by considering another approach. Maybe using a formula or counting the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as:\n\nFor units place: floor(N/10)*1 + min(1, N%10 >=d ? 1 :0). But since d is 4 and 8, which are less than 10, the formula would be floor(N/10) + (1 if N%10 >=d else 0).\n\nSimilarly, for tens place: floor(N/100)*10 + (min(10, N%100 +1) if (N/10)%10 >=d else 0). Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated, but perhaps applying it can help confirm.\n\nWait, let's try for 4's in units place:\n\nN=488.\n\nfloor(488/10)=48. Since 488%10=8 >=4, so add 1. So, 48+1=49? Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, for each complete 10, 4 appears once. So, 488//10=48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (page 484). Wait, but 488%10=8, which is greater than or equal to 4, so we add 1. So, total units 4's:48+1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48 because I considered only up to 480, but that's incorrect. Wait, no, 488 is included, so 481-488 includes page 484, which has a units digit of 4. So, units 4's:49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units 4's were 48, but now using this formula, it's 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total units 4's:48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for units 8's: each 10 pages, 8 appears once. 488//10=48, and 488%10=8, which is equal to 8, so add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought units 4's were 48, but that's incorrect. It's actually 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's correct that:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's:49\n- 8's:49\nDifference: 0.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, let me recount.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, for 488 pages, there are 48 full cycles of 10 (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n\nIn each full cycle, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times.\n\nIn the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total units 4's:48 +1=49.\n\nUnits 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nSo, units place: 4's=49, 8's=49. No difference.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial calculation.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nEach 100 pages, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49, etc.), so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nFor tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 pages.\n\nFor tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSo, total tens 4's:40 +10=50.\n\nTens 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nSo, tens place: 4's=50, 8's=49. Difference: 4's lead by 1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: no hundreds digit.\n\n100-199: hundreds digit 1, 100 times.\n\n200-299: hundreds digit 2, 100 times.\n\n300-399: hundreds digit 3, 100 times.\n\n400-488: hundreds digit 4, 89 times (since 488-400+1=89).\n\nSo, hundreds 4's:89.\n\nHundreds 8's:0, since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0. Difference: 4's lead by 89.\n\nNow, total 4's: units 49 + tens 50 + hundreds 89 = 49+50=99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units 49 + tens 49 + hundreds 0=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that's 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought units 4's were 48, I got 187-98=89. Now, with units 4's=49, it's 188-98=90.\n\nSo, I think my initial mistake was in the units place count. It's actually 49 for both 4's and 8's, so no difference there. Then, tens place gives 4's leading by 1, and hundreds place gives 4's leading by 89. So, total difference is 1+89=90.\n\nWait, but let's confirm again.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's:49\n- 8's:49\nDifference: 0.\n\nTens place:\n- 4's:50\n- 8's:49\nDifference: +1 for 4's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\nDifference: +89 for 4's.\n\nTotal difference: 0 +1 +89=90.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier when I used the formula, I thought units 4's were 49, but in my initial step-by-step, I thought it was 48. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial step-by-step. So, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just make sure.\n\nLet me list the counts again:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's:49\n- 8's:49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's:50\n- 8's:49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets (480 pages) + 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - '4' appears once in each set: 48 times + 1 in the extra pages (484) = 49 times.\n   - '8' appears once in each set: 48 times + 1 in the extra pages (488) = 49 times.\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in each block of 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) contribute 10 each, totaling 40 for both '4' and '8'.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488):\n     - '4' appears in 440-449: 10 times.\n     - '8' appears in 480-488: 9 times.\n   - Total '4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference: 50 - 49 = +1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in pages 400-488: 89 times.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = +89.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThus, there are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488). \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\n1. **Units place (the first digit from the right):**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - How many such groups of 10 are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times.\n   - But wait, the last group is 480-488, which is a partial group. In this partial group, 484 has a 4 in the units place. So that's one more 4.\n   - So total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (the second digit from the right):**\n   - Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place.\n   - How many such blocks are there? Well, from 0-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks.\n   - So that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n   - Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so it's valid. So yes, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (the third digit from the right):**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488.\n   - How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - How many such groups? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. That's 48.\n   - The last partial group is 480-488, which includes 488. So that's one more 8.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is a partial block.\n   - Each full block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 such full blocks (from 80-89 up to 380-389). Wait, 480-489 isn't fully included, so maybe only 4 full blocks.\n   - Let me count: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each with 10 8's, so 4\u00d710=40.\n   - Now, the partial block 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so numbers 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So that's 9 more.\n   - So total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 50, but let me recount. 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 8's, so 4\u00d710=40. Then 480-488 is another 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So 40 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the block 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. Hmm, but earlier I thought the tens place might be 50, but I corrected myself to 49. So 98 is correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So subtract the total 8's from the total 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's a big difference. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, one 4. So 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last group (480-488) has 484, so one more. So 49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. 48 full groups (each 10 numbers) gives 48, plus 488, which is one more, so 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, earlier I thought 480-488 is a partial block, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So for the tens place:\n\nFull blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's four blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4\u00d710=40.\n\nThen, 480-488: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So 9.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. Is 480-488 correct? 480 has an 8 in the tens place, yes, and up to 488. So that's 9 numbers, as 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\n\nFor the tens place 8's:\n\n- The first occurrence is 80-89: 10 numbers.\n- Then 180-189: another 10.\n- 280-289: another 10.\n- 380-389: another 10.\n- Then 480-488: 9 numbers.\n\nSo that's 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98. So 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the hundreds place, 440-449 is included in both the hundreds and tens place counts, but each digit is counted separately, so that's okay.\n\nSimilarly, 480-488 is in the tens place for 8's, but not in the hundreds place because 8 is in the tens, not hundreds.\n\nWait, but in the 4's count, 440-449 is in both hundreds and tens place, but each digit is counted separately, so that's correct.\n\nI think my counts are accurate. So the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (from 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (from 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (from 400-488)\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (from 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (from 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in numbers.

So, I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI'll handle each digit place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there?\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and an extra 8 numbers.\n   - In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.).\n   - So, 48 groups \u00d7 1 = 48 times.\n   - Now, the extra 8 numbers (481 to 488) don't include another 4 in the units place because 484 is within this range. Wait, 484 is page number 484, so that's another 4 in the units place.\n   - So, total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - From 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488).\n   - In each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so another 10 times.\n   - So, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive).\n   - So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So yes, 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check each part.\n\nUnits place:\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40.\n- Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, okay.\n\n**Now, counting the number of 8's:**\n\nLet me do the same for digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups and 8 extra numbers.\n   - Each group contributes 1, so 48.\n   - The extra 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - From 1 to 488, we have 4 full hundreds and a partial hundred (401-488).\n   - Each full hundred contributes 10, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 times.\n   - So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, 9 times. So yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - So, 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check again.\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups \u00d71 = 48, plus 488 which is another 8, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds \u00d710 = 40, plus in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 times. So 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since 800 is beyond 488. Correct.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Now, finding the difference:**\n\nNumber of 4's: 188\nNumber of 8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when I counted the 4's in the hundreds place, I considered from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each hundred has 10 times, so 4 hundreds \u00d710 =40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 times. So 40 +10=50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, it's 9 times, so 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the units place for 8's. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence?\n\nThe last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. So, units place for 8's is 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in units place, same logic: 4,14,...,484. So, 484 is the last one. So, 484 is 4 + 10*(n-1)=484 \u2192 10*(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times. Correct.\n\nWait, so both 4's and 8's have 49 in the units place. But for tens place, 4's have 50 and 8's have 49. And hundreds place, 4's have 89, 8's have 0.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 +50 +89=188\n8's total:49 +49 +0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. Correct.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, right? So, 488 is page 488, which is in the hundreds place as 4. So, yes, 488 is included in the 400-488 range.\n\nWait, but 400 to 488 is 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Finally, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, I should consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nI'll tackle the digit 4 first. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, 4 appears in a block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nWell, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, for the tens place, 4 can appear in the 40-49 range in the first hundred, then 140-149 in the second, 240-249 in the third, 340-349 in the fourth, and 440-449 in the fifth hundred. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 440-449, which is fully within 488. So, how many blocks is that?\n\nFrom 0 to 4 in the hundreds place, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5\u00d710=50.\n\nBut wait, does the 440-449 block go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 blocks, 50 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The digit 4 in the hundreds place appears in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, then 401, ..., up to 488. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in all places: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when I counted units place, I had 48 full tens and then 8 extra numbers, giving 49. That seems correct because 488 / 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus one more in the 484, making 49.\n\nFor the tens place, 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So, total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, in every set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, how many full blocks are there?\n\nLet's see: 0-99: 80-89 is one block, contributing 10 8's in the tens place.\n\n100-199: 180-189, another 10.\n\n200-299: 280-289, another 10.\n\n300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n\n400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here because 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but 480-489 would be a full block, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 8's.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 8 in tens place.\n\n180-189: 10.\n\n280-289: 10.\n\n380-389: 10.\n\n480-488: 9.\n\nTotal: 10\u00d74 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, when counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as contributing 9 8's in the tens place. But 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all of these, so yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, 4 blocks of 10, each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40, plus 9, total 49 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, plus 1 more in 488, total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98 8's.\n\nFor 4's, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's was 89, but let me check that again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 4's, I had 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place of 4's: 49.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nAnd for 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nWhen counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct because each of these blocks is within 488.\n\nYes, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct.\n\nSo, 50 in the tens place for 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one partial block of 9 (480-488). So, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nSo, 49 in the tens place for 8's.\n\nUnits place for both digits:49 each.\n\nSo, 4's total:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's total:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, for the hundreds place of 4's, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, correct.\n\nUnits place of 4's: 48 full tens, each contributing one, plus one more in 484, correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8's, units:48 full tens, plus one in 488.\n\nTens place:4 full blocks, plus 9 in 480-488.\n\nSo, yes, 49 each.\n\nSo, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make off-by-one errors.\n\nLet me try another approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, plus if the last partial set has a 4, add one. The last page is 488, so the units digit is 8, so the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 484, so one more 4. So, total 48 +1=49.\n\nSame for 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last partial set has an 8, which it does (488), so 48+1=49.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), but wait, actually, it's better to think in terms of how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nEach time the tens digit cycles through 0-9, 4 appears once per hundred. So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Since 488 is less than 500, we have 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and a partial hundred (400-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, 4 full hundreds \u00d710=40.\n\nIn the partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, 10 more.\n\nTotal tens digit 4's:40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nEach hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8, e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nNumber of full hundreds:4 (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40.\n\nIn the partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers:480-488. So, 9.\n\nTotal tens digit 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNumber of 8's: From 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds digit again. From 400-488, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, there are none in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, 188 4's and 98 8's, difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a number from 1 to 488, right? So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the digits separately, maybe breaking it down into units, tens, hundreds place. That seems logical because each position (units, tens, hundreds) can be handled individually.\n\nSo, I'll start with the units place. For each set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, ..., the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. That means, for the digit 4, it appears once every ten numbers, and the same goes for 8. \n\nBut wait, I need to consider how many such sets there are in 488 pages. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete set of ten, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units digit, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, and similarly for 8's, it's also 48. But then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding that, the total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times. That means, so far, the difference is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every ten numbers. For example, from 1-10, the tens digit is 0 or 1, but actually, in page numbers, I think the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, and so on. Wait, no, page 1 is just 1, so maybe it's better to think of each ten's place as a block of ten numbers where the tens digit is fixed.\n\nSo, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in blocks of ten numbers. For example, pages 40-49 have a tens digit of 4, and pages 80-89 have a tens digit of 8.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, pages 40-49: that's 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, pages 140-149: another 10 times, and pages 240-249: another 10 times. Wait, but does 488 go up to 480-489? Let me check: 488 is less than 490, so the last block for the tens digit 4 would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). Hmm, wait, that's not right. Wait, 480-489 is ten pages, but 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit 4 appears 9 times in that last block. Wait, no, wait: 480 is the 480th page, so 480-489 would be pages 480 to 489, which is 10 pages, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 4 in the 480-489 block only goes up to 488, so that's 9 pages with tens digit 4. Wait, no, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit 4 appears 9 times in that block.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Pages 40-49: 10 pages, so 10 times 4 in the tens place. Similarly, pages 140-149: another 10 times, and pages 240-249: another 10 times. Then, pages 340-349: another 10 times. Wait, but 340-349 is 10 pages, right? So, that's four blocks where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 times, so 4 x 10 = 40 times. But wait, does 488 include another block where the tens digit is 4? Let me see: 400-409: 10 pages, 410-419: another 10, 420-429: 10, 430-439: 10, 440-449: 10, 450-459: 10, 460-469: 10, 470-479: 10, 480-489: 10. Wait, but 488 is before 489, so in the 480-489 block, the tens digit is 8, right? Wait, no, 480 is 480, so the tens digit is 8? Wait, no, 480 is 4-8-0, so the tens digit is 8, not 4. Wait, no, wait, 480 is 4 in the hundreds place, 8 in the tens, and 0 in the units. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, so that block doesn't contribute to the tens digit being 4. So, the blocks where the tens digit is 4 are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is another block where the tens digit is 4. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 pages, so that's another 10 times. So, that would be five blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5 x 10 = 50 times for the tens digit 4. Hmm, but wait, does 440-449 fit within 488 pages? Yes, because 449 is less than 488.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 480-489 is where the tens digit is 8, so that's correct. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, each contributing 10 times, so 5 x 10 = 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit 8, let's see where that appears. The blocks would be 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Each of these blocks is 10 pages, so 5 blocks x 10 = 50 times. But wait, 480-489 is within 488 pages, so that's correct. So, the tens digit 8 appears 50 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the units place, both 4 and 8 appeared 49 times each, but in the tens place, both appear 50 times each. So, so far, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99. And the total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99. So, the difference would be zero? But that seems odd because the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the tens digit for 4 and 8. Let me check again.\n\nFor the tens digit 4:\n\n- 40-49: 10 pages, so 10 times 4 in the tens place.\n- 140-149: 10 pages, another 10 times.\n- 240-249: 10 pages, another 10 times.\n- 340-349: 10 pages, another 10 times.\n- 440-449: 10 pages, another 10 times.\n\nThat's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times.\n\nFor the tens digit 8:\n\n- 80-89: 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- 180-189: 10 pages, another 10 times.\n- 280-289: 10 pages, another 10 times.\n- 380-389: 10 pages, another 10 times.\n- 480-489: 10 pages, but wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages, right? So, in the 480-489 block, only 9 pages are present, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in that block.\n\nWait, so that changes things. So, for the tens digit 8, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 pages, contributing 10 times each, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, the 480-488 block has 9 pages, so 9 times. So, total tens digit 8's would be 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because the book ends at 488, so the last block for the tens digit 8 is incomplete. So, the tens digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nSo, now, for the tens digit:\n\n- 4 appears 50 times.\n- 8 appears 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 49, so difference is +1 for 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488, and then 5 would be beyond 488, so not applicable.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only in pages 400-488. Now, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWhat about the hundreds digit 8? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. 8 would be in the hundreds place only if the page numbers were 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times.\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, difference here is +89 for 4's.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. Difference: 0.\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49. Difference: +1.\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. Difference: +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 each, so difference zero. Tens place: 50 vs 49, so +1. Hundreds place: 89 vs 0, so +89. So total difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial decade, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 48 +1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place: same logic, 48 full decades, each contributing 1, and in the last partial decade, 8 appears once (488). So, 48 +1 =49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 pages, so 5 blocks x10=50.\n\nFor 8's: blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 8's in tens place here is 9. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one block of 9, so 4x10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n8's: none, since the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit doesn't reach 8.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99+89=188.\n\n8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just cross-verify.\n\nAnother approach: calculate total number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n   - Each digit appears 48 times.\n   - In the last partial set (481-488), 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears in blocks of 10 pages.\n   - **4's:** Blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 (5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50).\n   - **8's:** Blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (last block has 9 pages).\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Pages 400-488 (89 pages).\n   - **8's:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n\nSumming up:\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the structure of page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to check each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI'll tackle each digit place one by one, starting with the units place, then the tens, and finally the hundreds.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48 complete sets. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 fours.\n   - However, in the last partial set (from 481 to 488), the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, I need to add 1 more.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place.\n   - Let's figure out how many such blocks are there in 488 pages.\n   - The first block is 40-49, which is within 1-100.\n   - The next blocks are 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid.\n   - So, how many blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is one, then every subsequent hundred has another. From 100-200, 200-300, 300-400, 400-500. But since we only go up to 488, the last block is 440-449, which is within 400-488.\n   - So, the number of blocks is 5? Wait, let me recount. From 1-100: 40-49 (1 block). Then 140-149 (2nd), 240-249 (3rd), 340-349 (4th), 440-449 (5th). So, 5 blocks in total.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours.\n   - But wait, does the 440-449 block go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, all 5 blocks are complete.\n   - So, total 4's in the tens place: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place?\n   - From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Therefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 \u00d7 1 = 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I considered 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Let me check the blocks again. From 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\n**Now, counting the number of 8's:**\n\nI'll follow a similar approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 8 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, the number of complete sets of 10 is 488 / 10 = 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights.\n   - In the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once at 488.\n   - So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489.\n   - Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place.\n   - Let's see how many such blocks exist in 488 pages.\n   - From 1-100: 80-89 (1 block).\n   - Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489.\n   - But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Wait, 480-489 is a block, but we only go up to 488. So, in the 480-489 block, only 480-488 are present, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). But in the tens place, the digit 8 appears in all these numbers, so that's 9 eights in the tens place for that block.\n   - So, let's count the blocks:\n     - 80-89: 10 eights\n     - 180-189: 10 eights\n     - 280-289: 10 eights\n     - 380-389: 10 eights\n     - 480-488: 9 eights\n   - So, total blocks contributing to tens place 8's: 4 full blocks (each 10) and 1 partial block with 9.\n   - So, total eights in tens place: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 1-100: 80-89 is one block, 10 eights. Then 180-189 is another, 280-289 another, 380-389 another, and 480-488. So, that's 4 full blocks and one partial. Each full block gives 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place, I had 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9 eights. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, from 1-488, every 10 numbers contribute one 8, so 48 complete sets (480 numbers) give 48 eights, and then in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the total 4's were 188 and 8's were 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But I'm not sure if I did the 4's correctly.\n\nWait, let me double-check the 4's count again.\n\n**Rechecking 4's count:**\n\nUnits place:\n- From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n- It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484.\n- The number of such numbers is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, we need to check if 488 has a 4 in the units place. 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence (since 484 = 48\u00d710 +4). Then, from 485-488, there's no 4 in the units place. So, units place 4's: 48.\n\nWait, but earlier I added 1 more for 484, making it 49. But now I'm thinking that floor(488/10)=48, so 48 times. But 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. So, 48 times, which would be up to 480. Then, from 481-488, the next multiple would be 490, which is beyond 488, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 481-488. So, that's 48 +1=49. So, correct, 49.\n\nTens place:\n- Blocks where tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n- Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d710=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so all 5 blocks are complete. So, 50 eights. Wait, no, we're counting 4's here. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89), each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nNow, 8's total was 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the 8's count. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 8's, I had 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights. So, total 40+9=49.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers from 800-899, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount, especially with overlapping ranges. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of counting each digit place separately, perhaps I can consider each position and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nBut I think my initial method is correct. Let me just verify the counts again.\n\n**Rechecking 4's:**\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 10n -6, where n=1 gives 4, n=2 gives14, etc. The last term \u2264488 is 484, which is when 10n -6 \u2264488 \u2192 10n \u2264494 \u2192 n \u226449.4, so n=49. So, 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks as before. So, 5\u00d710=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\n**Rechecking 8's:**\n\n- Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488. The nth term is 10n -2. For 488, 10n -2=488 \u2192 10n=490 \u2192n=49. So, 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four blocks are complete, each contributing 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. Total tens place:40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as a partial block. But in reality, 480-489 is a full block of 10, but since the book ends at 488, only 9 numbers are present. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in that block. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is to calculate how many full blocks of 100 there are, and then the partial block.\n\nFrom 1-488, the number of full hundreds is 4 (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400). Each full hundred contributes one block of 10 where the tens digit is 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.), each contributing 10 eights. So, 4\u00d710=40.\n\nThen, the remaining pages are from 401-488, which is 88 pages. In this range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nThus, total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSimilarly, for units place, from 1-488, the number of times 8 appears is floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 ends with 8, we add 1 more, making it 49.\n\nSo, yes, 49 units place 8's.\n\nThus, the total 8's are 49+49=98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8 and subtract the two counts to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, I'll need to analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI remember that when counting digits, it's helpful to look at each position (units, tens, hundreds) individually and calculate how many times each digit appears in each position. So, I'll handle each digit place one by one for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. \n   - From 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 full groups of 10 and a remainder of 8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times plus one more in the last partial group (since 481 would have a 4 in the units place, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the last partial group is 481-488. So, the units place in this group would include 484, which is a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). \n   - From 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and an additional 88 pages (401-488). \n   - In each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 4*10 = 40 times.\n   - Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The digit 4 in the tens place would occur in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's another 10 times. Wait, but 440 is 440, which is within 401-488, so actually, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449). So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. \n   - From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). \n   - Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n   - Wait, but 400 is included, right? So yes, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48*1 = 48. Then, the remainder is 8, so from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 484 is within this range, contributing one more 4. So, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles 0-8, so 440-449 is within 401-488, contributing another 10. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, that's 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48*1 = 48.\n   - The remainder is 8, so from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 488 is included, which is an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40.\n   - Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8. The 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480 is within 401-488, so how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is included and 488 is the end. So, yes, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I did the 4's, I got 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 times. So, 40 (from the full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 48 full cycles (1-480) give 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 488 is included, which is one more 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't overcount anywhere. Sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the hundreds place, since 488 is less than 800, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 is correct.\n\nAnother thing to check is whether I correctly accounted for all the digits. Let me try a smaller example to see if my method works. Suppose we have a book with 20 pages. How many 1's and 2's are there?\n\nPage numbers: 1-20.\n\nCount of 1's:\n\nUnits place: 1,11,21 (but 21 is beyond 20). So, 1 appears twice in units place (1 and 11).\n\nTens place: 10-19, which is 10 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 1's: 2 + 10 = 12.\n\nCount of 2's:\n\nUnits place: 2,12,22 (22 is beyond 20). So, 2 appears twice (2 and 12).\n\nTens place: 20, which is one time.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 2's: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nDifference: 12 - 3 = 9.\n\nBut wait, let's count manually:\n\nNumbers: 1,2,...,20.\n\nNumber of 1's: 1,10-19, which is 1 (units) + 10 (tens) = 11, but wait, 11 has two 1's. So, actually, my method might be missing that.\n\nWait, in the units place, 1 appears once every 10 numbers, so in 1-20, that's 2 times (1 and 11). In the tens place, 10-19 is 10 numbers, each with a 1 in the tens place. So, 10 times. But 11 has two 1's, so does that affect the count? No, because I'm counting each digit separately. So, in the tens place, it's 10 times, and in the units place, it's 2 times. So, total 1's: 12.\n\nSimilarly, for 2's:\n\nUnits place: 2,12,22 (but 22 is beyond 20), so 2 and 12: 2 times.\n\nTens place: 20: one time.\n\nSo, total 2's: 3.\n\nDifference: 12 - 3 = 9.\n\nBut when I list them out:\n\n1: one 1\n\n2: one 2\n\n3: none\n\n...\n\n10: one 1\n\n11: two 1's\n\n12: one 1 and one 2\n\n13: one 1\n\n14: one 1\n\n15: one 1\n\n16: one 1\n\n17: one 1\n\n18: one 1\n\n19: one 1\n\n20: one 2\n\nSo, total 1's: 1 (1) + 10 (10-19) + 1 (11's second 1) = 12? Wait, no, because 11 has two 1's, so in the tens place, 10-19 gives 10 1's, and in the units place, 1,11 gives 2 1's, but 11 is already counted in the tens place. Wait, no, actually, when counting digits, each occurrence is counted separately. So, 11 has two 1's, so that's two separate counts. So, in the units place, 1 appears twice (1 and 11), and in the tens place, 10-19 gives 10 times. So, total 1's: 2 + 10 = 12. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, 2's: in units place, 2 and 12, so two 2's, and in tens place, 20, so one 2. So, total 3. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for the smaller example. Therefore, I think my approach is correct.\n\nGoing back to the original problem, so 4's total 188, 8's total 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the 4's count. Let me recount:\n\n4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full cycles (1-480) gives 48 4's. Then, 481-488: 484 is the only 4 in the units place, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place. 4 hundreds (1-400) give 40. Then, 401-488: the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10, total 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full cycles (1-480) gives 48 8's. Then, 481-488: 488 is included, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place. 4 hundreds give 40. Then, 401-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences, plus one more in 484. Total: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times in each hundred. From 1 to 400, that's 40 times. In 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 more. Total: 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, 48 full groups give 48 occurrences, plus one more in 488. Total: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times in each hundred. From 1 to 400, that's 40 times. In 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 more. Total: 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no pages 800-899. Total: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: the units place and the tens place. Because page numbers can be one, two, or three digits long, right? So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit. I'll need to calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each block of 10 pages. So, for every 10 pages, each digit appears once in the units place. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra pages. \n\nIn each of those 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so the digit 4 doesn't appear there. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, each block of 10 has one 8, so that's also 48 times. But wait, in the remaining 8 pages, the units digits go up to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. Therefore, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me check again. The remaining pages are 481-488, so the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, yes, 8 appears once there. So, units place: 48 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in a block of 100 pages, but each digit appears 10 times in each block of 100. For example, in pages 00-99, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). So, for each 100 pages, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, 488 pages mean there are 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 88 pages (400-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. That's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, pages 440-449 have the tens digit as 4, which is 10 pages. So, that's 10 more times. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, each 100 pages have 10 occurrences. So, 4 * 10 = 40. In the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit goes up to 8, so pages 480-488 have the tens digit as 8. That's 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 9 more 8's. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, it's 10 pages except when we reach 8, which only goes up to 88, so 9 pages. So, yes, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. For the hundreds digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in blocks of 1000, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. \n\nFor the digit 4 in the hundreds place, it appears from page 400 to 488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place, since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- 488 pages, so 48 full decades (0-9, 10-19, etc.), each contributing one 4 and one 8 in units. So, 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once more, making 49 eights. So, units: 48 fours, 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0-8. For fours, 440-449 is 10 pages. For eights, 480-488 is 9 pages. So, 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Fours: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 fours.\n- Eights: None, since 800-899 isn't part of the book.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full blocks.\n   - 4 appears 48 times; 8 appears 48 times.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488): units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once more.\n   - **Total:** 48 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 488 pages include 4 full hundreds (0-399): 40 fours, 40 eights.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (400-488):\n     - 440-449: 10 fours.\n     - 480-488: 9 eights.\n   - **Total:** 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488: hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n   - 800-899: not included.\n   - **Total:** 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n**Summing Up:**\n- **4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n- **Difference:** 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page number is a number from 1 up to 488. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nI remember that when counting digits, it's often helpful to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So maybe I should analyze the occurrence of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nLet's start by considering the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So in each set of ten, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. \n\nWait, but since we're only going up to 488, the last set won't be complete. Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten and then a partial set from 481 to 488. \n\nSo for the units place, in each complete set of ten, the digit 4 appears once and the digit 8 appears once. Therefore, in 48 complete sets, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. \n\nBut wait, the last partial set is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. So in the units place, we have 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So in this partial set, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from complete sets) + 1 (from the partial set) = 49. Similarly, the total number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nHmm, so so far, both 4 and 8 have the same count in the units place. Now, I need to check the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 80-89, which is 10 times.\n\nSo, considering the entire range up to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. \n\nWait, actually, 488 is in the 400s, so let me correct that. The complete hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Then from 401-488, which is 88 numbers.\n\nSo, in each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So for four complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the partial hundred from 401-488. The tens digits here range from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-490). But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit goes up to 8, but only up to 488, which is 488. \n\nWait, let me think. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each tens digit appears 10 times except for the last one, which might be less. Let me break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, each of these tens digits from 0 to 7 appears exactly 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). \n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Looking at the range 441-450, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 times. \n\nHow about 8? The tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. \n\nTherefore, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, adding this to the complete hundreds: \n\nTotal 4's in tens place = 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place = 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from partial) = 48.\n\nSo, so far, 4's have 50 in tens place, 8's have 48.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. \n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book has 488 pages. \n\nFor each hundred, the hundreds digit is fixed:\n\n- 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (but since we start at 1, maybe we don't consider 0 here)\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? 89 times.\n\nHow about 8? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's compute that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 97. \n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188 - 97 = 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nEach complete set of 10 has one 4 and one 8. There are 48 complete sets (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets). So 48 each. Then the last partial set is 481-488, which has one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8 doesn't appear here.\n\nSo, totals:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: perhaps I should consider each digit place separately, and for each place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear, then sum them up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor units place:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is given by:\n\nNumber of complete cycles * 1 + extra in the incomplete cycle.\n\nSimilarly for tens, hundreds, etc.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\nNumber of 4's = floor(488 / 10) + (1 if 4 >= (488 % 10) else 0). Wait, no, that might not be accurate.\n\nWait, actually, the formula is:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place from 1 to N is:\n\ncomplete = N // 10\nremainder = N % 10\ncount = complete * 1\nif d <= remainder:\n    count += 1\nif d == 0:\n    count -= 1  # because 0 doesn't appear in units place for numbers like 10, 20, etc., but I think in our case, we're counting digits, so 0 in units place is allowed for numbers like 10, 20, etc.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we're counting digits, so 0 in units place is allowed. So, for digit 4, in units place:\n\ncomplete = 488 // 10 = 48\nremainder = 488 % 10 = 8\nsince 4 <= 8, count = 48 * 1 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8:\n\ncomplete = 48\nremainder = 8\nsince 8 <= 8, count = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, that matches our earlier count.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in tens place from 1 to N is:\n\ncomplete = N // 100\nremainder = (N // 10) % 10\ncount = complete * 10\nif d < remainder:\n    count += 10\nelif d == remainder:\n    count += (N % 10) + 1\nelse:\n    pass\n\nWait, maybe I should look up the exact formula, but perhaps it's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nFor each digit place (tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated by considering how many full blocks of 100, 1000, etc., there are, and then the remainder.\n\nBut perhaps I've already calculated it correctly earlier. Let me just stick with my initial calculation.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for digit 4:\n\nIn each complete hundred, 10 times. There are 4 complete hundreds, so 40 times. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times. So total 50 times.\n\nFor digit 8 in tens place:\n\nIn each complete hundred, 10 times, so 40 times. In the partial hundred, 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So total 48 times.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place:\n\nDigit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nDigit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in this range.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit place (units, tens, hundreds). \n\n- **Units place**: 4 appears 49 times.\n- **Tens place**: 4 appears 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place**: 4 appears 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- **Units place**: 8 appears 49 times.\n- **Tens place**: 8 appears 48 times.\n- **Hundreds place**: 8 appears 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " I think the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can use a systematic approach by looking at each place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1 through 0. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10, so I'll have to adjust for the last partial block. Let me write this down.\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488).\n\nIn each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, and the same for 8's, 48 times 1, which is 48.\n\nBut wait, in the last partial block (pages 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, does 4 appear? Yes, at 484, and 8 appears at 488. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nHmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero. Interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, ..., 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per 100 numbers.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem. The total pages are 488, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for the four hundreds, that's 4 times 10 = 40 each for 4's and 8's.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, let's check when the tens digit is 4 and 8.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, 2 for 420-429, 3 for 430-439, 4 for 440-449, 5 for 450-459, 6 for 460-469, 7 for 470-479, and 8 for 480-488.\n\nSo, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so that's 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times.\n\nAnd 8 appears 40 (from the four hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. The difference here is 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 numbers. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, it's 1, 200-299 it's 2, 300-399 it's 3, and 400-488 it's 4.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 appears in the hundreds place... Wait, does it? Let me think. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page numbers were 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in this book. Therefore, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. The difference here is 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 blocks with a remainder of 8.\n- So, 48 each, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), 484 has a 4 and 488 has an 8. So, 48 +1 =49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each block of 100 has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- There are four full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 each.\n- Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449 (10 numbers) and 8 from 480-488 (9 numbers).\n- So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +9=49 for 8's. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n- 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n- Difference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nWe analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers has one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 pages mean 48 full blocks and 8 extra pages.\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place, plus once more in the extra pages (484 for 4 and 488 for 8).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - Four full hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - In the last partial block (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSumming up:\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a number from 1 to 488, right? So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the digits in the units place and the tens place separately. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the numbers 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. Therefore, for the units place, every ten numbers contribute one 4 and one 8.\n\nNow, how many complete groups of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of ten and then an extra 8 numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times (once in each group of ten), and the same goes for the digit 8. But wait, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial group, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484), and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total count for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4's and 8's. Wait, no, that's not right. Because in each complete group, it's 48 times, and then the partial group adds one more for each. So, units place: 48 +1 =49 for 4's, and 48 +1=49 for 8's. So, units place contributes equally to both digits.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every ten numbers. So, for example, from 1-10, the tens digit is 0 or 1, but actually, in page numbers, the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it as each digit in the tens place being fixed for ten numbers. So, for the tens digit to be 4, the numbers would be from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Similarly, for the tens digit to be 8, the numbers would be 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 instead of 480-489.\n\nLet me calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each time the tens digit is 4, it's for ten numbers, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. So, from 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Then 140-149: another 10, so total 20. 240-249: another 10, total 30. 340-349: another 10, total 40. Now, 440-449: another 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 more, making it 50. So, the digit 4 appears 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow for the digit 8 in the tens place. Let's see, 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. 180-189: another 10, total 20. 280-289: another 10, total 30. 380-389: another 10, total 40. Now, 480-489: but our book ends at 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total for tens place is 40 (from the first four groups) plus 9, which is 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times. So, that's a difference of 1 more 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For the 4's in the tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 times. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nNow, so far, in the units and tens places, we have:\n\nUnits place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49.\n\nTens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49.\n\nSo, total for both places so far: 4's = 49 + 50 = 99, and 8's = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 4's are one more than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have missed something because the hundreds place might also have 4's and 8's. Let me check that.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit can be 0,1,2,3,4, etc., but since we're dealing with page numbers up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3, or 4.\n\nFor the hundreds digit to be 4, the numbers are from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the hundreds digit to be 8, the numbers would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nNow, adding this to our previous counts:\n\nTotal 4's = Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's = Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify this. Maybe I can think about how many 4's and 8's are in each position and sum them up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a systematic approach.\n\nIn each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), we can calculate the number of times a digit appears.\n\nLet me try this for the units place:\n\nFor each position, the number of times a digit d appears is calculated as follows:\n\nFor a given position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times d appears is:\n\n- Let n be the number of pages, which is 488.\n\n- Let pos be the current position (1 for units, 10 for tens, 100 for hundreds).\n\n- higher = n divided by (pos * 10), integer part.\n\n- current = (n / pos) % 10.\n\n- lower = n % pos.\n\nThen, the count is:\n\nif current > d: count += (higher + 1) * pos\n\nelif current == d: count += higher * pos + lower + 1\n\nelse: count += higher * pos\n\nBut since we're dealing with digits 4 and 8, let's apply this formula for each digit.\n\nWait, maybe it's a bit complicated, but let me try for the units place.\n\nLet's take d = 4 and pos = 1 (units place).\n\nn = 488.\n\nhigher = 488 // (1*10) = 48.\n\ncurrent = (488 // 1) % 10 = 8.\n\nlower = 488 % 1 = 0.\n\nSince current (8) > d (4), count += (higher + 1) * pos = (48 +1)*1 = 49.\n\nSo, 49 times 4 appears in units place. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8, units place.\n\nhigher = 488 // 10 = 48.\n\ncurrent = 8.\n\nlower = 0.\n\nSince current (8) >= d (8), count += higher * pos + lower +1 = 48*1 +0 +1 =49.\n\nSo, 49 times 8 appears in units place. Correct.\n\nNow, for the tens place, pos=10.\n\nd=4:\n\nhigher = 488 // (10*10) = 488 // 100 = 4.\n\ncurrent = (488 // 10) % 10 = 48 %10 = 8.\n\nlower = 488 %10 = 8.\n\nSince current (8) > d (4), count += (higher +1)*pos = (4+1)*10=50.\n\nSo, 50 times 4 appears in tens place. Correct.\n\nFor d=8, tens place:\n\nhigher=488//100=4.\n\ncurrent=8.\n\nlower=8.\n\nSince current=8 >= d=8, count += higher*10 + lower +1=4*10 +8 +1=40+8+1=49.\n\nSo, 49 times 8 appears in tens place. Correct.\n\nNow, for hundreds place, pos=100.\n\nd=4:\n\nhigher=488 // (100*10)=488//1000=0.\n\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4%10=4.\n\nlower=488%100=88.\n\nSince current=4 >= d=4, count += higher*100 + lower +1=0*100 +88 +1=89.\n\nSo, 89 times 4 appears in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nFor d=8, hundreds place:\n\nhigher=0.\n\ncurrent=4 <8, so count += higher*100=0.\n\nSo, 0 times 8 appears in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\nFor 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nFor 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss any edge cases. For example, in the hundreds place, does 400 count as a 4? Yes, it's included in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nAlso, in the tens place, when the current digit is 8, like in 480-488, we correctly accounted for 9 numbers, so 9 times the tens digit is 8. That seems right.\n\nAnother way to check: total number of digits used. Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many digits are printed.\n\nPages 1-9: 1 digit each, total 9.\n\nPages 10-99: 2 digits each, total 90 pages, so 180 digits.\n\nPages 100-488: 3 digits each, total 488 - 99 = 389 pages, so 389 *3=1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits:9 +180 +1167=1356 digits.\n\nNow, total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 +98=286 digits accounted for. But 286 is much less than 1356, so that's okay, just checking.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, but I think my previous calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 groups.\n   - Each group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages.\n   - For 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 sets of 10 pages each.\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - For 8's: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 full sets and 9 extra pages.\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's appear in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89.\n   - 8's do not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately\u2014like the units place, tens place, hundreds place\u2014and count how many times the digit 4 appears in each, then do the same for 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, right? So from page 1 to 488, how many groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, it's 48 full groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last group might have an extra page, but since 488 is a multiple of 10 minus 2, actually, the last group is 480-488, so the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times, right? Because 488 divided by 10 is 48, and each of those contributes one 4 in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, it's the same logic. From 1 to 488, each group of 10 has one 8 in the units place, so that's also 48 times. Wait, but hold on, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, maybe I should check if 488 is included. Let me see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then the last group has an extra 8 in the units place because 488 ends with an 8. So, actually, it's 49 times for 8 in the units place. Hmm, wait, no, because 480 is the start of the 48th group, and 480 to 488 is 9 pages, so the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, in that last group, 8 appears once in the units place. So, total units place 8's are 48 (from the first 480 pages) plus 1 more from 488, making it 49. But wait, 480 is the 48th group, so 480-489 would be 49 groups, but our book ends at 488. So, maybe it's 48 full groups (1-480) contributing 48 8's, and then 481-488 is 8 more pages, which includes 488, so that's one more 8. So, total 49 8's in the units place. But for 4's, since 488 doesn't end with a 4, the units place for 4's is 48. So, units place gives us 48 fours and 49 eights. So, 4's are actually one less than 8's in the units place. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. For units place, every 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480 pages, which is 48 groups of 10. So, 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 pages. The units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this range, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so actually, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. So, that's equal. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me double-check. From 1 to 480, 48 groups of 10, so 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, 481-488: pages 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, units digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 +1=49 fours, and 48 +1=49 eights. So, they are equal in the units place. So, no difference there.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in each block of 100 pages, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times every 100 pages. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n\nSo, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights. Now, we have 401-488 left. Let's see, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. But wait, 488 is the end, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's 10 fours. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). So, 9 eights. Therefore, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50, and tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's are one more than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, right? So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total hundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the places.\n\nUnits place: 4's=49, 8's=49.\n\nTens place: 4's=50, 8's=49.\n\nHundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 -98=90, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me check again. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 eights.\n\nSo, total 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any digits. Each page number is considered separately, so each digit is counted correctly in its respective place. So, I think this is correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** 48 complete groups of 10 (1-480) contribute 48 fours. Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (484). Total: 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, 48 groups contribute 48 eights, and page 488 adds one more. Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 10 fours each, totaling 40. Pages 401-488 add 10 fours (440-449). Total: 50.\n   - **8's:** 400-488 contributes 9 eights (480-488). Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours.\n   - **8's:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately\u2014like units, tens, hundreds\u2014and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place. That way, I can sum them up for the entire range from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, in each set of ten, there's one 4 and one 8. \n\nBut wait, I need to check how many complete sets of ten there are in 488. Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nSo, in the units place, each complete set contributes one 4 and one 8. That would be 48 sets, so 48 4's and 48 8's. Now, the extra numbers from 481 to 488: looking at the units digits here, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8. \n\nWait, no, actually, 481 is 481, so the units digits from 481 to 488 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in the units place, we have one 4 and one 8 in these extra numbers. Therefore, the total for the units place is 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. Hmm, so they're equal in the units place. That's interesting.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49) and 8 ten times (80-89). \n\nBut since the book has 488 pages, let's see how many complete hundreds there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place. \n\nNow, looking at the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nFrom 401-410, the tens digit is 0. From 411-420, it's 1. Continuing this way, 421-430 is 2, 431-440 is 3, 441-450 is 4, 451-460 is 5, 461-470 is 6, 471-480 is 7, and 481-488 is 8. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears once in 441-450, which is 10 times (but wait, 441-450 is actually 10 numbers, so the tens digit is 4 for all of them, which is 10 times. Similarly, 481-488 is 8 in the tens place, but there are only 8 numbers, so that's 8 times. \n\nWait, but hold on, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, not 10. So, in the tens place for 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). \n\nSo, adding that to the previous 40, the total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 4's and 40 + 8 = 48 8's. \n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, yes, 10 and 8. So total for tens place: 40 +10=50 4's, 40 +8=48 8's. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nHow about 8? Well, in the hundreds place, 8 would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. \n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have one 4 and one 8, so 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), 4's in the tens place occur 10 times (441-450), and 8's occur 8 times (481-488). So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, 40 +8=48 for 8's. That looks right.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 doesn't appear. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 49+50+89=188 for 4's, and 49+48+0=97 for 8's. 188-97=91. So, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any errors in the steps I took. So, the answer should be 91.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contains one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete sets (480 pages) contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 and one 8.\n   - **Total:** 49 4's, 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contains 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 4's, 48 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total:** 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\n**Summing Up:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and each of these numbers is printed once. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, so maybe I should approach this by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I can analyze each position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers, right? So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit appears once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. Similarly, from 11 to 20, units digits go from 1 to 0 again, and so on.\n\nSo, for the units place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, the total number of pages is 488, so how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each block of 10, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times 1 is 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once more in 484. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, in each block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 48 blocks would give 48 times, and then in the remaining 8 pages, 8 appears in 488. So, that's once. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference in the units place is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digits go through 0-9 ten times each. Similarly, from 100-199, it's the same, and so on.\n\nSo, for the tens digit, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see. The total number of pages is 488, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each hundred block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, for each of the four hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, does 4 appear in the tens place here? Yes, in 440-449, but wait, our range is 401-488. So, 440-449 is within that range. That's another 10 times. Wait, but 488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is fully included because 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. Each hundred block contributes 10 times for the digit 4 in the tens place. So, four blocks give 40. Then, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that's another 10. So, total 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 times for 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, four blocks give 40. Then, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it only changes every 100 numbers. For the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in the numbers 400-499, but since our book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place, it would appear in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let me sum up the differences from each digit place:\n\n- Units place: 4's - 8's = 49 - 49 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 49 = 1\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra. Each full ten contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 * 1 = 48 for both. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8. So, four hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles 0-8. So, for 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 times, and for 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50; 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. So, the difference is 1. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 - 0 = 89. So, that's correct.\n\nAdding them up: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any chance I double-counted or missed something? Let me check each digit place again.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, last 8 pages: 481-488, units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units: 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred block, 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens digit. So, four blocks: 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for 4 in tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4's: 50, 8's: 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 complete blocks: 48 each.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8.\n   - Four complete hundreds: 40 each.\n   - Last partial block (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand what exactly is being asked. The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488, and each page number is printed once. I need to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit '8'. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nAlright, so maybe I should start by considering how digits are distributed in page numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits, specifically from 1 to 488. \n\nI think the best approach is to count the occurrences of each digit in each place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. That way, I can systematically count how many times '4' and '8' appear in each position.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a complete set of numbers. So, for example, in the numbers 1 to 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. But wait, our range goes up to 488, which isn't a multiple of 10, so I might have to adjust for that.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Again, since 488 isn't a multiple of 100, I'll have to check how many complete hundreds there are and then see how the remaining numbers affect the count.\n\nThe hundreds place is a bit different because it only starts appearing from page 100 onwards. So, for pages 1-99, there's no hundreds digit, but from 100 onwards, the hundreds digit becomes 1, 2, 3, or 4, since 488 is the last page.\n\nLet me tackle each digit place one by one for both '4' and '8'.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n\nI need to count how many times '4' appears in the units place from 1 to 488.\n\nIn every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, '4' appears once in each block of 10.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 numbers.\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and 8 extra numbers (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8).\n\nIn each complete block of 10, '4' appears once, so in 48 blocks, it appears 48 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, '4' appears once here as well.\n\nSo, total '4's in the units place = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, let's count '8's in the units place.\n\nAgain, in each block of 10, '8' appears once. So, in 48 complete blocks, it's 48 times. In the remaining 8 numbers, '8' appears once as well (units digit 8 in 488).\n\nSo, total '8's in the units place = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so both '4's and '8's appear 49 times in the units place. That means, in the units place, they are equal. So, the difference here is zero.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Here, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each (00-09, 10-19, ..., 90-99). But since we start at 1, the first block is 1-10, which actually doesn't have a tens digit of 0. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when considering the tens place, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, but since we're dealing with page numbers, I think the first page is 1, which is a single-digit number. So, perhaps it's better to consider each digit place separately without overlapping.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the tens place for all numbers, including single-digit ones, but with leading zeros. But in reality, page numbers don't have leading zeros, so the tens digit for numbers 1-9 is non-existent or zero, but since we're only considering the actual digits printed, maybe I should treat single-digit numbers as having only a units digit.\n\nThis might complicate things, but perhaps a better approach is to consider the tens digit for all numbers from 1 to 488, regardless of whether they are single-digit or not.\n\nSo, for the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place from 1-100.\n\nSimilarly, from 101-200, the tens digit cycles again 0-9 ten times each, and so on.\n\nBut our book only goes up to 488, so let's break it down.\n\nFirst, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for each hundred, '4' and '8' each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 4 complete hundreds, '4's in tens place = 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nSimilarly, '8's in tens place = 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, we have the remaining 88 numbers from 401 to 488. Let's analyze the tens place in this range.\n\nNumbers from 401 to 488: The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, since 488 is the last number.\n\nWait, let me list them:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let's check:\n\n401-410: 10 numbers, tens digit 0\n411-420: 10, tens 1\n421-430: 10, tens 2\n431-440: 10, tens 3\n441-450: 10, tens 4\n451-460: 10, tens 5\n461-470: 10, tens 6\n471-480: 10, tens 7\n481-488: 8 numbers, tens 8\n\nSo, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, with 0-7 each appearing 10 times, and 8 appearing 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488:\n\n- '4' appears in the tens place from 441-450, which is 10 times.\n- '8' appears in the tens place from 481-488, which is 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\n- '4's: 40 (from the first 4 hundreds) + 10 = 50\n- '8's: 40 (from the first 4 hundreds) + 8 = 48\n\nWait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Because in the first 4 hundreds (1-400), each hundred contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 each.\n\nThen, in the remaining 401-488, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (441-450) and '8' appears 8 times (481-488). So, adding those:\n\n- '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n- '8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nSo, the tens place contributes 50 '4's and 48 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n\nNow, the hundreds place. This is only relevant from page 100 onwards, up to page 488.\n\nThe hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book has 488 pages.\n\nLet's count how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: pages 100-199. That's 100 numbers, so '1' appears 100 times.\n- Hundreds digit 2: pages 200-299. Another 100 numbers, '2' appears 100 times.\n- Hundreds digit 3: pages 300-399. 100 numbers, '3' appears 100 times.\n- Hundreds digit 4: pages 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, '4' appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but we're only interested in '4's and '8's. So, in the hundreds place:\n\n- '4' appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n- '8' never appears in the hundreds place because the highest page is 488, which is in the 400s, not 800s.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- '4's: 89\n- '8's: 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor '4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal '4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor '8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal '8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, to find how many more '4's there are than '8's:\n\n188 (number of '4's) - 97 (number of '8's) = 91\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with '4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 50\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor '8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 48\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal: 49 + 48 = 97. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nHmm, but let me verify the counts again, especially in the tens and hundreds places, because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nEach block of 10 has one '4' and one '8'. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one '4' and one '8', plus the last 8 numbers (481-488) which include '4' once (484) and '8' once (488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 for both '4' and '8'. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFirst, the first 400 pages: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for both. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, with '4' appearing 10 times (441-450) and '8' appearing 8 times (481-488). So, '4's: 40 +10=50; '8's:40 +8=48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly '4' appears 89 times (400-488). '8' doesn't appear in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n'4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n\n'8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 91 seems like a lot, but considering that '4's appear in the hundreds place 89 times, which is a significant contribution, it might be correct.\n\nLet me think of another way to calculate this. Maybe by using a formula or another counting method.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of '4's and '8's separately and then subtract.\n\nBut perhaps I can also think about how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, another way: for each digit place, calculate the number of times '4' appears and the number of times '8' appears, then sum across all places.\n\nBut I think my initial method is correct. So, maybe 91 is the right answer.\n\nWait, but let me check the counts again, just to be thorough.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many '4's in units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, '4' appears once. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one '4', so 48, plus in the last partial ten (481-488), '4' appears once (484). So, total '4's in units place:49.\n\nSimilarly, '8's in units place: same logic, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's. So, 4 hundreds contribute 40 each.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (401-488), '4' appears in the tens place from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's.\n\n'8' appears in the tens place from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 '8's.\n\nSo, '4's in tens place:40+10=50; '8's:40+8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly '4' appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 '4's.\n\n'8's:0.\n\nSo, total '4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal '8's:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 91 more '4's than '8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of '4's printed is 188, and the number of '8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}."

    "text": " I think I'll start by understanding how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, I know that each page number is printed once, starting from 1 and ending at 488. So, the page numbers go from 001 to 488 if I consider each page as a three-digit number, but actually, they start from 1, so maybe I should think of them as one, two, or three-digit numbers. But for counting digits, it might be easier to consider all page numbers as three-digit numbers by padding with leading zeros, which would make it from 001 to 488. That way, I can analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately without missing any.\n\nWait, but does padding with leading zeros affect the actual count of digits? Because in reality, page 1 is just '1', not '001', so the leading zeros aren't printed. Hmm, but when counting the digits printed, leading zeros aren't part of the page numbers, so maybe I should consider page numbers as they are, without padding. That complicates things a bit because the number of digits varies depending on the page number. So, I need to count the number of 4's and 8's in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately for each page number from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me structure this by considering each digit place one by one: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears, then find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit goes from 0 to 9. The digit 4 appears once in each block (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears once in each block (e.g., 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10, and then 8 extra pages (from 481 to 488). In each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place.\n\nNow, looking at the extra 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place:\n\nThe tens digit changes every 10 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, 00-09 have 0 in the tens place, 10-19 have 1, and so on. So, for each digit, it appears 10 times every 100 numbers. But again, I need to adjust for the total number of pages, which is 488.\n\nLet me think: For the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 4's and 4*10 = 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see: 401-410 have 0 in the tens place, 411-420 have 1, 421-430 have 2, 431-440 have 3, 441-450 have 4, 451-460 have 5, 461-470 have 6, 471-480 have 7, and 481-488 have 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, but there are only 8 pages there, from 481 to 488. So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in these 88 pages?\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times.\n- Digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nAdding this to the 40 from the complete hundreds:\n\nTotal tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. The difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. For a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFirst, 8 in the hundreds place: Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can never be 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, 4 in the hundreds place: Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. The difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place:\n\n- Units place: 49 4's and 49 8's\n- Tens place: 50 4's and 48 8's\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's\n\nAdding these up:\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97\n\nNow, the difference is Total 4's - Total 8's = 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n488 pages. Units digit cycles every 10. 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. So 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So units: 48 +1=49 for 4's, same for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. 4 hundreds, so 40 each. Then, in the last 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 as follows:\n\n401-410: 0 (10 numbers)\n411-420:1 (10)\n421-430:2 (10)\n431-440:3 (10)\n441-450:4 (10)\n451-460:5 (10)\n461-470:6 (10)\n471-480:7 (10)\n481-488:8 (8)\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n4 appears in 441-450: 10 times\n8 appears in 481-488: 8 times\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n4's: 40 +10=50\n8's:40 +8=48\n\nThat's correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears from 400-488: 89 times\n8 appears 0 times\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)= 188\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0=97\n\nDifference: 188-97=91\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits place: as before, 49\nTens place:50\nHundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:48\nHundreds place:0\nTotal:49+48=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nHmm, seems consistent. But let me think if there's another approach to verify.\n\nAnother way is to consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is given by:\n\ncount = (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(d, N % 10), 0 if d <= N % 10 else 1)\n\nWait, maybe a better formula is:\n\nFor units digit, each digit 0-9 appears floor(N/10) times. Then, for the remaining N % 10 pages, digits 0 to (N % 10) appear one more time.\n\nBut since we're starting from 1, not 0, maybe we have to adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:\n\nFor units digit, the number of times digit d appears from 1 to N is:\n\ncount = (N // 10) * 1 + (1 if d <= (N % 10) else 0)\n\nBut wait, for d=0, it's a bit different because 0 doesn't appear in the units place for numbers 1 to N. So, perhaps the formula is:\n\nFor d \u2260 0: count = (N // 10) + (1 if d <= (N % 10) else 0)\n\nFor d=0: count = (N // 10) - 1 (since 0 doesn't appear in the units place for numbers 1 to N)\n\nWait, let me test this with a small N, say N=13.\n\nNumbers 1-13:\n\nUnits digits:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3\n\nDigits 1-9 appear twice (except 0 appears once). Wait, no, actually:\n\nFrom 1-10, units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0\n\nThen 11,12,13: units digits 1,2,3\n\nSo, for d=1: appears in 1,11 => 2 times\nd=2: 2,12 =>2\nd=3:3,13 =>2\nd=4:4 =>1\nd=5:5 =>1\nd=6:6 =>1\nd=7:7 =>1\nd=8:8 =>1\nd=9:9 =>1\nd=0:10 =>1\n\nSo, using the formula for d=4:\n\ncount = (13 //10) + (1 if 4 <= (13 %10) else 0) = 1 + (1 if 4<=3 else 0) =1 +0=1, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for d=1:\n\ncount=1 + (1 if 1<=3 else 0)=1+1=2, which is correct.\n\nFor d=0:\n\ncount= (13//10) -1 + (1 if 0 <= (13%10) else 0) ?\n\nWait, no, maybe the formula is different for d=0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to not use a formula and stick with the initial approach since N=488 is manageable.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's recast the problem:\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: as calculated, 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:188\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more 4 (484) and 1 more 8 (488).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 hundreds, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 441-450: 10 times 4.\n     - 481-488: 8 times 8.\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488: 89 times 4.\n   - Pages 1-488: 0 times 8.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n\\boxed{91}"

That sounds like a plan.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, right? Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once in each set of ten. So, from page 1 to 480, how many complete sets of ten do we have? Well, 480 divided by 10 is 48. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 each appear 48 times. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so there are 8 more pages after 480. Let me check those. Pages 481-488. In the units place, 481 has a 1, 482 a 2, and so on up to 488, which has an 8. So, in these extra 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more in the units place. That means in the units place, 4 appears 48 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, so far, 4 is behind by one in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for each hundred, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds do we have in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages. Wait, no, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds (1-400) plus 88 pages. So, each of the 4 hundreds contributes 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. That's 4*10=40 for each digit. Now, let's look at the remaining 88 pages, which are from 401 to 488. The tens digit in these pages ranges from 0 to 8. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nFrom 401-410, the tens digit is 0. 411-420, it's 1, and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. So, in the 400s, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Now, the digit 4 appears in the tens place only once in this range, which is from 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 pages (480,481,...488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, in the 400s, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nSo, adding that to the previous 40 times each, we have for the tens place: 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 is ahead by one.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit across all places.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 times for 4, 49 for 8. Correct, because from 1-480, 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, from 481-488, only 8 appears once more in the units place. So, 48 vs 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times each for 4 and 8. So, 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 each. Then, in the 400s, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 40+10=50 for 4, 40+9=49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up: 48+50+89=187 for 4's. 49+49+0=98 for 8's. 187-98=89. So, 4's appear 89 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I was calculating the tens place in the 400s, I considered 480-488 as 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. But wait, the tens digit is 8 for all those pages, right? So, 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, so 9 times. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once, making it 49 for 8 in the units place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct from 400-488.\n\nSo, yes, 187 total 4's and 98 total 8's. The difference is 89. So, 4's are printed 89 more times than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

Because the number 488 is a three-digit number, I'll need to look at each place where the digits 4 and 8 can appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for units place, both 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. But wait, I should check if the total number of pages is a multiple of ten. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times (once every ten pages) plus an extra time if 484 is within the range. Wait, 484 is within 481-488, so that's one more 4. So, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Units place 8's: 48 times, since 488 is the last page, and 488's units digit is 8, so that's an extra 8. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. Hmm, so no difference there.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears ten times in a set of 100 pages. So, for example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for each hundred, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. Now, since the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in the tens place, for each hundred, 10 times each for 4 and 8. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 times each. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0-8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So, adding to the previous 40 each, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49, so 4's have one more.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, it's 1, 200-299 it's 2, 300-399 it's 3, and 400-488 it's 4. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every ten pages.\n   - Total sets of ten in 488 pages: 48 full sets (1-480) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - 4 appears 48 times in the units place, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n   - 8 appears 48 times, plus one more in 488, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit appears ten times every hundred pages.\n   - 488 pages consist of 4 full hundreds (1-400) and 88 extra pages (401-488).\n   - In each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place, totaling 40 each.\n   - In 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50; 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference**: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Sounds like a plan.\n\nLet me start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nI remember that when counting digits in numbers, it's helpful to look at each place (units, tens, hundreds) individually and calculate how often each digit appears in each place. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many times does this happen? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think it's 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is actually 48.8, which means there are 48 complete decades and then 8 extra pages. So, in each of the 48 complete decades, the units digit is 4 once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial decade (pages 481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. If I take 488 divided by 10, that's 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, yes, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in 10 consecutive numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nLet me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, for each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4.\n\n- 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers)\n- 100-199: 140-149 (10)\n- 200-299: 240-249 (10)\n- 300-399: 340-349 (10)\n- 400-488: 440-449 (10) but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers.\n\nSo, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, so that's fine. So, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402, ..., up to 488. So, yes, 89 numbers. So, hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me add again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Okay.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, similar to the 4's, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nDividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: pages 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, yes, 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then 488 adds another one, so 49 in total. That seems correct.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in 10 consecutive numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each of these blocks contributes 10 8's except the last one, which contributes 9.\n\nWait, let me clarify: from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\n- 1-99: 80-89 (10)\n- 100-199: 180-189 (10)\n- 200-299: 280-289 (10)\n- 300-399: 380-389 (10)\n- 400-488: 480-488 (9, because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check if 480-488 is 9 numbers. 488 - 480 + 1 = 9, yes. So, 49 in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I had 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That seems right because the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 0,1,2,3,4. Each of these hundreds has a 40-49 block, except for 400-488, which still includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 5 blocks. So, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, we had 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits: 49 each, because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups and one partial group with one extra occurrence. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 89, because 400-488 is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: 0, because the book doesn't reach 800. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula or something else to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nFor units place:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + (1 if the units digit of n is >= d else 0). Wait, but actually, it's a bit more precise.\n\nWait, no, the formula is a bit different. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to n is:\n\nnumber_of_times = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0) if d != 0 else (n // 10).\n\nBut in our case, d is 4 and 8, which are non-zero, so for each digit, it's (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0).\n\nWait, let me test this formula with n=488.\n\nFor units digit 4:\n\nn//10 = 488//10 = 48\n\nn%10 = 8\n\nSince 8 >=4, we add 1. So, total units place 4's: 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8:\n\nn//10=48\n\nn%10=8\n\nSince 8 >=8, we add 1. So, units place 8's:48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, that matches what I calculated before.\n\nFor tens place, the formula is a bit more involved. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n can be calculated as:\n\nhigher = n // 100\n\ncurrent = (n // 10) % 10\n\nlower = n % 10\n\ncount = higher * 10\n\nif current > d:\n    count +=10\nelif current == d:\n    count += lower +1\n\nBut this is for non-zero digits.\n\nWait, let me test this for d=4 and n=488.\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 =4\n\ncurrent = (488 //10) %10 =48%10=8\n\nlower=488%10=8\n\ncount= higher *10=4*10=40\n\nSince current=8 > d=4, count +=10, so 40+10=50. Correct, which matches our earlier count of 50 for tens place 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nhigher=4\n\ncurrent=8\n\nlower=8\n\ncount=4*10=40\n\nSince current=8 ==d=8, count += lower +1=8+1=9, so total count=40+9=49. Correct, which matches our earlier count of 49 for tens place 8's.\n\nFor hundreds place, the formula is:\n\nnumber of times digit d appears in hundreds place from 1 to n is:\n\nif d ==0: 0\n\nelse:\n\nhigher = (n // 1000)\n\ncurrent = (n // 100) %10\n\nlower = n %100\n\ncount = higher * 100\n\nif current > d:\n    count +=100\nelif current ==d:\n    count += lower +1\n\nBut let's apply this for d=4 and n=488.\n\nhigher=488//1000=0\n\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4%10=4\n\nlower=488%100=88\n\ncount=0*100=0\n\nSince current=4 ==d=4, count += lower +1=88+1=89. So, hundreds place 4's:89. Correct.\n\nFor d=8:\n\nhigher=0\n\ncurrent=4\n\nlower=88\n\ncount=0\n\nSince current=4 <8, count remains 0. So, hundreds place 8's:0. Correct.\n\nSo, using this formula, I get the same counts as before, which reinforces that my initial calculations were correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the alternative formula approach confirms the counts. So, I'm confident the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit's occurrence in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 full groups of 10, plus 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 4's).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 full groups of 10, plus 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (4 full blocks of 10, plus 9 from 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I'm going to start by understanding the problem clearly and then figure out a systematic way to count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, the book has pages numbered from 1 to 488. Each page number is printed once. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. Since we're dealing with numbers up to 488, the hundreds place can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let me go through each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. To find the total number of 4's in the units place, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 and then add any extra numbers if 488 isn't a multiple of 10.\n\n   So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. That means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and 8 extra numbers. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. The extra 8 numbers (from 481 to 488) don't include a 4 in the units place because the units digits go from 1 to 8, and 4 is included in 484, which is within the 481-488 range. Wait, actually, 484 is within that range, so that's one more 4. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   Wait, no. Let me correct that. When I divide 488 by 10, I get 48 full decades and then 8 numbers. Each full decade contributes 1 four in the units place, so 48 fours. Now, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is in this range, so that's one more four. So, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many such blocks are there in 488?\n\n   The hundreds digit goes from 0 to 4. For each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. So, let's see:\n\n   - From 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours\n   - From 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours\n   - From 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours\n   - From 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours\n   - From 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours\n\n   Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 fours. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\n   Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 10 fours there.\n\n   So total tens place 4's: 5*10=50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n\n   Wait, but actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours. So, hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, in each block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 eight, so 48 eights. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, which has units digits from 1-8, so 8 is included once (488). So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks are in 488.\n\n   - From 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights\n   - From 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights\n   - From 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights\n   - From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights\n   - From 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 here, the tens digit is 8, so numbers 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\n   So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) contributing 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify these calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades (1-480) contribute 48 fours, and in 481-488, 484 has a 4 in units place, so 49 total. Correct.\n- Tens place: Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 fours in the tens place, and since we have 5 such blocks (up to 400), that's 5*10=50. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so total tens place 4's: 50 + 10=60? Wait, no, wait. Wait, earlier I thought each hundred contributes 10 fours, so 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. For the tens place, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, from 1-100, 40-49: 10 fours. Similarly, 101-200: 140-149: 10 fours. 201-300: 240-249: 10 fours. 301-400: 340-349: 10 fours. Now, 401-488: the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. So, tens place 4's: 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades (1-480) contribute 48 eights, and in 481-488, 488 has an 8 in units place, so 49 total. Correct.\n- Tens place: From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 40 +9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0, since we don't reach 800. So, total 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if in the tens place for 8's, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct, 9 eights.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 481-488 includes 488, so that's one more 8 in the units place, making it 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there.\n\nWait, but when I added up the units, tens, and hundreds for 4's, I got 49 +50 +89=188. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the units place of 4's. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, so 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing one 4 in units place, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSame for 8's in units place: 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus 488, which adds one more, making 49. Correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the tens place for 4's. Let me think again. Each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 1-100: 40-49: 10 fours. 101-200:140-149:10 fours. 201-300:240-249:10 fours. 301-400:340-349:10 fours. Then, 401-488:440-449:10 fours. So, that's 5 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: from 1-100:80-89:10 eights. 101-200:180-189:10 eights. 201-300:280-289:10 eights. 301-400:380-389:10 eights. Then, 401-488:480-488:9 eights. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 188 fours minus 98 eights, which equals 90 more fours.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can think of another way to calculate this. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately and sum them up.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- For 4's: As before, 48 full decades (1-480) contribute 48 fours, plus 484 in 481-488, so 49.\n- For 8's: 48 full decades contribute 48 eights, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. There are 5 hundreds (0-4), so 5*10=50.\n- For 8's: Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last partial hundred where only 9 are present. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n- For 8's: There are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place up to 488, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think about the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 8's, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with a tens digit of 8, so 9 eights. So, in the tens place, 4 blocks of 10 (1-400) contribute 40 eights, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nSo, yes, all counts seem accurate. Therefore, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Finally, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. But since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits, specifically up to 488.\n\nI remember that when counting digits, it's helpful to break it down by the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately. So I'll handle each digit position one by one for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4, I'll count how many times it appears in each position.\n\n1. **Units place (the first digit from the right):**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - How many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll consider 48 full blocks and then handle the remaining 8 pages separately.\n   - So, in 48 full blocks, the digit 4 appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - Now, the remaining pages are from 481 to 488. Let's check the units digits here: 481, 482, ..., 488. The units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place here (at 484).\n   - So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (the second digit from the right):**\n   - For the tens place, the digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - How many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages beyond that (401-488).\n   - In each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n   - Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the tens place. Specifically, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, the tens digit is 4 in the block 440-449, which is 10 numbers (440, 441, ..., 449).\n   - However, we only go up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's another 10 times.\n   - Wait, but 401-488 includes 401 to 488, so 440-449 is within that range. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times here.\n   - Therefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (the third digit from the right):**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place?\n   - From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n   - However, I should check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is included, so it's 89 numbers.\n   - Wait, but when considering page numbers, each page number is printed once, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, moving on to counting the digit 8.\n\nAgain, I'll break it down by units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, in each block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - Number of full blocks: 48 (since 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks)\n   - So, 48 times in the units place.\n   - Remaining pages: 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488).\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For the tens place, in each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - Number of full hundreds: 4, so 4 *10 =40 times.\n   - Remaining pages: 401-488. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 8 in the block 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but we only have up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, that's 9 times.\n   - Wait, but 480 is included in 401-488, so yes, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 numbers.\n   - So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 49 +49 is 98, yes.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks (1-480) give 48, then 481-488 has one more (484), so 49. That seems right.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40, then 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10, so 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks (1-480) give 48, then 481-488 has 488, so one more, total 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds give 40, then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 49. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so 9 times. So total 40+9=49.\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nSo total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers range from 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), and 3-digit (100-488).\n\nI think it would be helpful to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by counting the number of 4's in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, the 4 is in page 4; in 11-20, it's in page 14, and so on.\n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and a partial set of 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of these 48 complete sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial set from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is in this range, which adds one more 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every set of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). Since the book has 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, there are 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in the range 440-449. That's 10 more 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 400-488. How many times does 4 appear here? From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me think again. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, but 488 - 400 is 88, so adding 1 gives 89. So, yes, 89 times. So, total 4's in the hundreds place are 89.\n\nNow, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, in 488 pages, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and a partial set of 8. So, 48 times in the units place, plus in the partial set, 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: In each set of 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). So, for 4 complete hundreds (1-400), that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so that's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. Wait, but actually, each number from 480 to 489 has an 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check again. For the tens place in the partial hundred, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 (from the first four hundreds) plus 9 gives 49 in the tens place. Units place was 49, so total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Wait, in the units place, for each set of 10, we have one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last partial set from 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the total 4's were 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, let me go through the 4's again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digit 4 appears in 484, so that's one more, making it 49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: Each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, making it 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's: Units place, 49; tens place, 49; hundreds place, 0. So, 98 total.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 8's. So, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89. So, in 400 numbers, that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, total 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units digit, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 times in the full sets, plus once in the last partial set, making it 49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Correct.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of 10 (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the last partial set = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (4 \u00d7 10) + 10 in the last partial hundred = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers from 400-488 = 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of 10 (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the last partial set = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 in the last partial hundred = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number since 488 is a three-digit number. I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can systematically count how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nStarting with the digit '4', I'll count how many times it appears in the units place, then the tens place, and finally the hundreds place. I'll do the same for the digit '8' in each place and then compare the totals.\n\nLet's begin with the units place for '4'. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit '4' appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10: 4; 11-20:14; and so on.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll consider 48 full blocks and then the remaining 8 pages (from 481 to 488). In each full block of 10, there's one '4' in the units place, so 48 blocks give 48 '4's. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, '4' appears once here as well. So, total '4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's count '4's in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit '4' appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, each hundred block contributes 10 '4's in the tens place.\n\nHow many full hundred blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then the remaining 88 pages (401-488). In each full hundred, there are 10 '4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 4 * 10 = 40 '4's. Now, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see: from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; ... up to 481-490, but wait, we only go up to 488, so the tens digit in 481-488 is 8. So, does the tens digit '4' appear in this remaining block? Let me check: 401-410: tens digit 0; 411-420: 1; 421-430: 2; 431-440: 3; 441-450: 4. Wait, yes, from 441-450, the tens digit is 4, so that's 10 numbers: 441,442,...,450. But wait, our upper limit is 488, so 450 is included. So, that's another 10 '4's in the tens place. So, total '4's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When I calculated the full hundreds as 4 * 10 = 40, that's correct. Then in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit '4' appears from 440-449, right? But 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers, so 10 '4's. So, total '4's in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 401-488, correct. So, yes, 10 '4's in the tens place in the remaining block. So, total '4's in tens place: 50.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place for '4'. The hundreds digit is '4' for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is '4' in all these 89 numbers, so that's 89 '4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total '4's in all places: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 '4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for '8's. I'll start with the units place.\n\nUnits place for '8's: Similar to '4's, in every block of 10 numbers, '8' appears once in the units place. So, from 1-10: 8; 11-20:18; etc.\n\nNumber of full blocks in 488 pages: 48 full blocks (480 pages) and 8 remaining pages (481-488). Each full block contributes 1 '8', so 48 '8's. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, '8' appears once here. So, total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, '8's in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, '8' appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, each hundred block contributes 10 '8's in the tens place.\n\nNumber of full hundreds in 488: 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and 88 remaining pages (401-488). So, in each full hundred, 10 '8's, so 4 * 10 = 40 '8's.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see where '8' appears. The tens digit '8' occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is '8' only in 480-489, but since we're stopping at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but in terms of tens digit, 480-489 would have tens digit '8', but 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488, the tens digit is '8' for all these numbers. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, that's 9 '8's in the tens place in the remaining block.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 480,481,...,488: each of these has tens digit '8', correct. So, 9 '8's here.\n\nSo, total '8's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place for '8's. The hundreds digit is '8' only in the block from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches '8'. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 '8's.\n\nSo, total '8's in all places: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so '4's total 188 and '8's total 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more '4's than '8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, '4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks (480 pages) give 48 '4's, and the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have one more '4' at 484. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred (1-100, etc.) has 10 '4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit '4' occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's. So, total 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 '4's. So, 49 +50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, '8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks give 48 '8's, and the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have one '8' at 488. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred gives 10 '8's, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 401-488, the tens digit '8' occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: No '8's because the book ends at 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal '8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check the tens place for '8's again. In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit '8' occurs in 480-488. But 480 is within 401-488, right? So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with tens digit '8'. So, 9 '8's. So, yes, 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens digit '8' in the remaining block, does 480 count as part of the remaining 88 pages? Because 401-488 is 88 pages, right? 488 -400 =88, but 401 is the first page after 400, so 401-488 is 88 pages. But 480 is within that range, so yes, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 9 '8's. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about the tens digit '8' in the remaining 88 pages: from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when does the tens digit become '8'? It's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 '8's.\n\nSo, total '8's:49+49=98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything in the hundreds place. For '4's, the hundreds digit is '4' from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. For '8's, the hundreds digit would be '8' from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no '8's in the hundreds place. So, correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the number of '4's is 188, and '8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me recount the '4's and '8's in a different way.\n\nAlternative approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of '4's and '8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of '4's: floor(488/10) =48, plus 1 if the remainder is >=4. 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49.\n\nNumber of '8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if the remainder is >=8. 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of '4's: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10 '4's, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. How many times does '4' appear in the tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's. So, total '4's in tens place:40 +10=50.\n\nNumber of '8's: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10 '8's, so 4*10=40. In the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit '8' occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 '8's. So, total '8's in tens place:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of '4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since we're dealing with 3-digit numbers, the hundreds digit is '4' from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 '4's.\n\nNumber of '8's: The hundreds digit '8' would be from 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0 '8's.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n'4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n'8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that confirms it again. So, the answer should be 90 more '4's than '8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of '4's printed is 188, and the number of '8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I think I should first understand how page numbers are structured and then count the occurrences of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, I know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. So, I should consider each digit place\u2014units, tens, and hundreds\u2014separately because the frequency of each digit might vary in each place.\n\nLet me start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll consider 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, the last group might have an extra number, right? Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the 48th group ends at 480, and the next group is 481-488. In this last partial group, does the units place have a 4? Let's see, 484 is within 481-488, so that's another 4. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from the full groups) plus 1 (from the partial group) = 49.\n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. When you have 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 4 appears in each set of 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8 in the last set. So, in the last set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So, total units place 4's would be 48 (from 48 full sets) plus 1 (from the last partial set) = 49.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check with a smaller number. Suppose I have 14 pages. Then, the units digit 4 appears at 4 and 14, so that's 2 times. 14 divided by 10 is 1.4, so 1 full set gives 1, and the last partial set (11-14) includes 14, which adds another 4, so total 2. That works. So, applying that logic, 488 pages would have 48 full sets (each contributing 1) plus 1 more in the last partial set, so 49 4's in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long, so each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are.\n\nFrom 40-49: that's one range, contributing 10 4's.\n\nFrom 140-149: another range, another 10.\n\nSimilarly, 240-249: another 10.\n\n340-349: another 10.\n\n440-449: another 10.\n\nWait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's five ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 x 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 4's, so 50 in total. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 400 to 488 is 89 numbers? Let me check: 488 - 400 = 88, so adding 1 gives 89. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 4's.\n\nWait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in every set of 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8. So, total units place 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, same as 4's in units place. Hmm.\n\nNow, the tens place for 8's: The tens digit is 8 for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check each range.\n\nFirst, 80-89: that's 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's in the tens place.\n\n180-189: another 10.\n\n280-289: another 10.\n\n380-389: another 10.\n\n480-488: Now, this is a partial range because 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers are in 480-488? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers, contributing 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. So, how many more 4's than 8's? 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each gives 10 4's, so 5 x 10 = 50. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges gives 10 8's, and the last gives 9, so 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits: 49 each, because 488 is included in the last partial set, adding one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 48 full sets (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, same logic: 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and in the last set, 488 adds another 8, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: For 4's, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. For 8's, there are no hundreds digits of 8 because the book ends at 488, so 0.\n\nSo, yes, 188 4's and 98 8's. The difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I calculated the units place for 4's, I included 484, which is in 481-488, but does that affect the count? Let me see: 484 is the 4th number in 481-488, so yes, it's included once, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, 488 is included, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is, for units digits, the number of times a digit d appears is floor(n/10) + (1 if the last digit is >= d else 0), but I think I've already accounted for that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula. For each digit place, the count of digit d in position p (units, tens, hundreds) can be calculated as:\n\ncount = higher * 10^(p-1) + (if current > d, add 10^(p-1); else if current == d, add (lower + 1))\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating it for now. I think my initial approach was correct.\n\nWait, but let me try applying that formula to confirm.\n\nFor units place (p=1) for digit 4:\n\nhigher = 488 / 10 = 48 (integer division)\ncurrent = 488 % 10 = 8\nlower = 8\n\nSo, count = higher * 1 + if current > 4, add 1, else if current ==4, add (lower +1). Since current is 8 >4, so count = 48*1 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units place for 8:\n\nhigher = 488 /10=48\ncurrent=8\nlower=8\n\ncount = higher*1 + if current>8? No. current=8, so add (lower +1)=8+1=9. So, total 48 +9=57? Wait, that contradicts my earlier count of 49. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the formula for the number of times digit d appears in the units place up to number N is:\n\ncount = (N // 10) * 1 + (1 if N % 10 >= d else 0)\n\nWait, but when d is 8, N=488.\n\nSo, count = (488 // 10) *1 + (1 if 488%10 >=8 else 0) = 48*1 +1=49. So, correct.\n\nWait, so my initial calculation was correct. So, for 8's in units place, it's 49.\n\nWait, maybe I confused the formula earlier, but now it's clear.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in units place, same calculation: 48 +1=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, for tens place, digit 4:\n\nWe can use the formula:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10 + (if (N % 100) //10 >4, add 10; else if (N%100)//10 ==4, add (N%10 +1); else 0)\n\nSo, N=488.\n\nN//100=4\n\n(N%100)//10=88//10=8\n\nSince 8>4, we add 10.\n\nSo, count=4*10 +10=50. Which matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in tens place:\n\ncount = (488//100)*10 + if (488%100)//10 >8? No. (488%100)=88, so 88//10=8. So, equal to 8, so add (488%10 +1)=8+1=9.\n\nSo, count=4*10 +9=49, which matches my earlier count.\n\nFor hundreds place, digit 4:\n\ncount = (488//1000)*100 + if (488%1000)//100 >4? 488//1000=0, so higher=0.\n\nThen, current=(488%1000)//100=4.\n\nSince current=4, add (488%100 +1)=88 +1=89.\n\nSo, count=0*100 +89=89. Correct.\n\nFor digit 8 in hundreds place:\n\ncount = (488//1000)*100 + if (488%1000)//100 >8? 488//1000=0, current=4, which is less than 8, so add 0.\n\nThus, count=0. Correct.\n\nSo, using this formula, I get the same counts as before. So, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can check with smaller numbers to see if the formula works.\n\nFor example, let's take N=14.\n\nHow many 4's? Units place: 4 and 14, so 2 times.\n\nTens place: 40-49, but 14 is less than 40, so 0.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 4's:2.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nUnits place for 4:\n\nhigher=14//10=1\n\ncurrent=14%10=4\n\ncount=1*1 +1=2. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4:\n\nhigher=14//100=0\n\ncurrent=(14%100)//10=1\n\nsince 1<4, count=0*10 +0=0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's=2+0=2.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in N=14.\n\nUnits place:\n\nhigher=14//10=1\n\ncurrent=14%10=4 <8, so count=1*1 +0=1 (since 4<8, no addition). Wait, but in N=14, the 8 in units place is only at 8, so that's 1. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8:\n\nhigher=14//100=0\n\ncurrent=(14%100)//10=1 <8, so count=0*10 +0=0.\n\nSo, total 8's=1+0=1.\n\nDifference:2-1=1, which is correct because from 1-14, 4 appears twice (4,14) and 8 appears once (8).\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nAnother test: N=89.\n\nHow many 4's?\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,...,84: 9 times (since 89//10=8, and 89%10=9 >=4, so 8+1=9).\n\nTens place: 40-49:10 times.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 4's:9+10=19.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18,28,...,88: 9 times (89//10=8, 89%10=9 >=8, so 8+1=9).\n\nTens place:80-89:10 times.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:9+10=19.\n\nDifference:19-19=0.\n\nWhich makes sense because up to 89, the counts are equal.\n\nWait, but in reality, up to 89, 4's and 8's are both 19. So, correct.\n\nAnother test: N=48.\n\nHow many 4's?\n\nUnits place:4,14,24,34,44: 5 times (48//10=4, 48%10=8 >=4, so 4+1=5).\n\nTens place:40-49: but N=48, so only 40-48:9 numbers, so 9 4's in tens place.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 4's:5+9=14.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18,28,38,48:5 times (48//10=4, 48%10=8 >=8, so 4+1=5).\n\nTens place:80-88: but N=48, so no tens place 8's.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:5.\n\nDifference:14-5=9.\n\nWhich is correct because from 1-48, 4's appear 14 times and 8's 5 times.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90 more 4's.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem properly. Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, so maybe I should start by counting the number of 4's in each digit place\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014and then do the same for 8's. That makes sense because digits can appear in different places, and I don't want to miss any.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll consider each place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\n1. **Counting 4's in the units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n   - So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - To find out how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488, I can divide 488 by 10 and take the integer part.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours.\n   - But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, yes, 48 is correct.\n\n2. **Counting 4's in the tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 00-09, 10-19, ..., 90-99.\n   - In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers: 40-49.\n   - So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds.\n   - Each of these 4 hundreds contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10 fours.\n   - So total fours in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Counting 4's in the hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Yep, that seems right.\n\nNow, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Counting 8's in the units place:**\n   - Similar to the fours, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8. That's 48 eights.\n   - In the last partial block (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once more (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Counting 8's in the tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - In each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 eights.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them except 489, which is beyond 488. Wait no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them because 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481, 482, etc., up to 488. So that's 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place.\n   - So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Counting 8's in the hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check again. Units: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I thought that in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds contribute 40, plus 9, which is 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total fours: 187, total eights: 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFirst, fours:\n\n- Units place: 48 (since 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and in the last 8 pages, 481-488, 4 doesn't appear in units. So 48 fours in units.\n- Tens place: For each hundred, 40-49 gives 10 fours. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So 40 +10=50 fours in tens.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds. So 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 48+50+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then in 481-488, units digit is 8 at 488, so one more. Total 49.\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. 4 hundreds give 40. Then in 400-488, tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So 9. Total tens place 8's: 40+9=49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 187 fours minus 98 eights is 89. So, 89 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the units place for 8's, I included 488, which is correct because 488 is a valid page. Similarly, when counting tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 480 is included and 488 is the end.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Let's consider each digit place separately again.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4, so no extra 4. So 48.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/10) = 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1. So 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100) = 4 full hundreds. Each contributes 10 fours in tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, the remaining 88 pages (400-488) have 89 pages, but we're looking at the tens digit. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So 40 +10=50.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/100)=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, the remaining 88 pages (400-488) have tens digit 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 40 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nNumber of 8's: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nAdding up:\n\nFours: 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =187.\n\nEights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So the answer should be 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Because when counting digits, each place can contribute independently to the total count. So, I'll probably need to calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, same with the digit 8. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each of those 48 blocks, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Now, looking at the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place counts: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, they are equal. \n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages (e.g., 40-49). Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (80-89). So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? That's 4 full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds go up to 400-488. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times for each digit. But wait, the last hundred is only up to 488, so the tens digit in 400-488 goes from 0 to 8. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, which is 9 possibilities, but since 488 is the last page, the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, but only 9 pages (480-488 is 9 pages, right? Wait, 480, 481,...,488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, but wait, actually, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 10. Similarly, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in 400-499, but since we're only going up to 488, does that affect the count? Wait, no, because 400-488 includes 400-409, 410-419,...,480-488. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, which is 10 pages, and in 410-419, which is another 10 pages, but wait, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409 and 440-449? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, the tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, for 400-409, the tens digit is 0, and the units digit is 0-9. So, the tens digit 4 in the 400s would be 440-449, which is 10 pages. Similarly, in the 480s, the tens digit is 8, but only up to 488, so that's 9 pages. So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, for each of the first three hundreds (1-399), the tens digits 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. So, 3 hundreds * 10 = 30 times each. Then, in the 400-488 block, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. So, total tens place counts: 4 appears 30 + 10 = 40 times, and 8 appears 30 + 9 = 39 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once more than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. For each hundred block, the hundreds digit is fixed. So, in 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're only considering 1-488, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 40\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178\n\nFor 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 39\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 39 + 0 = 88\n\nNow, the difference is 178 (number of 4's) minus 88 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 to both 4 and 8, so 48 each. Then the last 8 pages (481-488) have 4 at 484 and 8 at 488, so 1 each, making 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For the first three hundreds (1-399), each hundred contributes 10 to both 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 3 * 10 = 30 each. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 30 + 10 = 40 for 4, and 30 + 9 = 39 for 8. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all, so 0. That seems right.\n\nAdding up: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178 for 4's. For 8's: 49 + 39 + 0 = 88. Difference is 178 - 88 = 90. So, yes, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Analyze Each Digit Place Separately:**\n   - **Units Place:** For every 10 pages, each digit (0-9) appears once in the units place. In 488 pages, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages, each contributing one '4' and one '8'. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one '4' (484) and one '8' (488). Thus, '4' appears 49 times and '8' appears 49 times in the units place.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:** Each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For the first 300 pages, there are 3 blocks, each contributing 10 '4's and 10 '8's. In the last 88 pages (400-488), '4' appears 10 times (440-449) and '8' appears 9 times (480-488). Thus, '4' appears 40 times and '8' appears 39 times in the tens place.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, totaling 89 times. The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n2. **Sum the Counts:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - 178 (number of '4's) - 88 (number of '8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are \\boxed{90} more '4's printed than '8's."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Because the number of times a digit appears in each place might vary, especially since 488 is a three-digit number. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, right? So from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, and then a partial set from 481 to 488. \n\nSo, in each complete set of ten, the units digit is 4 exactly once. Therefore, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times 1, which is 48. Now, for the partial set from 481 to 488, I need to check if there's a 4 in the units place. Looking at 484, that's a 4 in the units place. So that's one more 4. So total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so only 484 has a 4 in the units place. So yes, 49 total 4's in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, it's again 40-49, another 10 times, and so on.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 400s. \n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages, so that's 10 times per hundred. So for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. Wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 4 full tens (40-49, 50-59, etc.) but actually, 401-488 is 88 pages, so the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). \n\nWait, no, 401-488 is actually 88 pages, starting at 401. So the tens digit in this range would be 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). \n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, so how many times does the tens digit equal 4 in this range? The tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? Because 440 is less than 488. So that's another 10 times. So total tens digit 4's would be 40 (from the first four hundreds) plus 10 (from 440-449) = 50. \n\nWait, but hold on, 401-488 is 88 pages. Let me think again. The tens digit cycles every 10 pages, so from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; ...; 441-450, tens digit is 4; 451-460, tens digit is 5; etc., up to 481-490, but we stop at 488. So in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449). So that's correct, adding 10 more to the 40 from the first four hundreds, making it 50 total 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (401-410, 411-420, ..., 481-490). Wait, 88 divided by 10 is 8.8, so 8 full tens and a partial. But 481-490 is only up to 488, so that's 8 pages. So in the tens place, 4 occurs once every 100 pages, so in the 400s, it occurs from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so yes, 10 times. So total 4's in tens place: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nWait, but actually, 1-400 has four hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then 401-488 is another 88 pages, which includes 440-449, adding 10 more. So yes, 50 total.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, let me check: 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So yes, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, in each set of ten, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten? 48 complete sets (1-480), each contributing one 8 in units place, so 48. Then from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more. So total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480 is the last page of the 48th set, so 481-488 is 8 pages. The units digits are 1-8, so 488 is the only one with 8 in units place. So yes, 49 total 8's in units place.\n\nNow, tens place. The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. \n\nEach of these ranges contributes 10 times except maybe the last one. Let's see:\n\nFrom 1-400, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's 80-89 (10 pages), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 pages (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, 480 has tens digit 8, 481-488 also have tens digit 8, so that's 9 pages. But wait, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 pages. So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 480-488.\n\nSo total tens digit 8's would be 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1-400, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each 10 pages, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 0 times.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 4's were 188 and 8's were 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's. But let me double-check my calculations because 4's in hundreds place being 89 seems high, but maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, let me go through each digit place again for both 4 and 8.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete sets of 10 (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then 484 adds one more, so 49.\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times (40-49), so 4 hundreds give 40. Then 440-449 adds another 10, so total 50.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete sets (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then 488 adds one more, so 49.\n- Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: 4*10=40. Then 480-488 is 9 pages, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in hundreds place. That seems correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times, which adds to 40, making 49.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 4's, I considered 440-449 as an additional 10, but is that correct? Because 440-449 is within 400-488, which is part of the 401-488 range. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the total number of 4's is 188 and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the units place for 8's? From 1-488, in units place, 8 appears once every 10 pages, so 48 times from 1-480, then 488 adds one more, making 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn tens place for 8's, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each 10 pages, so 4 sets, 40 times. Then 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 more, totaling 49.\n\nSo yes, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds, so 98 total 8's.\n\nAnd for 4's, 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds, totaling 188.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula for each digit place.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place from 1 to N is floor((N)/10) + (1 if the units digit of N is >= d else 0).\n\nSimilarly, for tens place: floor((N)/100) * 10 + max(0, min(10, N%100 - d*10 +1)).\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, I can use the method I did before.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's:\n\nFrom 1-400, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, each 10 pages, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so total 50.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488, tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so that's 0, which is correct.\n\nSo, final answer: 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 all the way up to 488. So, I guess I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have those counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same. But wait, I need to check if 488 is a multiple of 10 or not because the last set might not be complete.\n\nSince 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each complete set of ten, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that would be 48 times 1 for both 4's and 8's. But then in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the units digit 4 appears once (on page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (on page 488). So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, which is also 49. Wait, but that seems like the same count, so maybe the units place doesn't contribute to the difference. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here because I thought the 4's and 8's would be the same, but let me check again.\n\nWait, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, yes, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place in the partial set. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, same count, no difference here.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 80-89, which is another 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10 = 40 for both 4's and 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, we need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. So, in the partial hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding that to the complete hundreds, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50, and the number of 8's is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times, so that's a difference of 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's there. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's. From 200-299, it's 2, again no 4's or 8's. From 300-399, it's 3, still no. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Since 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. That's a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit position.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's there. In the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49. Units place is 49 each. So, 4's: 89 + 50 + 49 = 188, and 8's: 0 + 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place. So, from 1-400, the tens digit cycles four times (each hundred). Each time, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. So, 4 times 10 is 40 for both. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449) and 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's, correct. No 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nUnits place: from 1-488, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except perhaps the last partial set. Wait, but I calculated 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each, and then the last partial set from 481-488, which adds one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, same for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nSo, adding it all up, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, so 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 each.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - The partial hundred (401-488) contributes 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since page numbers go from 1 to 488, I'll need to check how often the digits 4 and 8 appear in each of these places.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 more pages (481 to 488). In each of those 48 blocks, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, here, I see one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488). So, in the units place, total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 +1 = 49. So, they're equal here.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (1-9), 1 (11-19), 2 (21-29), etc., up to 9 (91-99). So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many hundreds do we have in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, let's consider each hundred separately.\n\nFirst, from 1-100: In the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, that's 10 4's and 10 8's.\n\nNext, from 101-200: Similarly, the tens digits go from 0 to 9 again. So, 4 appears 10 times (140-149) and 8 appears 10 times (180-189). So, another 10 each.\n\nFrom 201-300: Same pattern. 4 appears 10 times (240-249) and 8 appears 10 times (280-289). So, another 10 each.\n\nFrom 301-400: Again, 4 appears 10 times (340-349) and 8 appears 10 times (380-389). So, 10 each here.\n\nNow, from 401-488: Here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for the 4's in the tens place, we have 40-49, but since we're starting at 401, it's 440-449. Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, the 4's in the tens place would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Similarly, 8's in the tens place would be 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles as 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, for the 4's in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's. For the 8's in the tens place, it's 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488, so that's 9 pages. So, 9 8's in the tens place here.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, we have 10 4's and 9 8's.\n\nAdding this up for all the hundreds:\n\nFrom 1-400: 10 (4's) + 10 (8's) per hundred, so 4 hundreds would give 40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite right. Because from 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400: each of these hundreds contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's.\n\nThen, from 401-488, as we saw, it's an additional 10 4's and 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 4's and 40 + 9 = 49 8's.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 49. So, 4's are one more than 8's here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488.\n\nWait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, because they're two-digit numbers. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's there.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, 8's in the hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place are zero.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89 and 8's are 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total number of 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8, so 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 4's in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's. 8's in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's. So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 4's, and 40 +9=49 8's. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times. 8's in hundreds place: 0. So, 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nI think that's right. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. We analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages), contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 49, 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - For 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - From 401-488, the tens place adds 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 50, 8's: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n   - Total 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page has a number from 1 to 488, and each digit in these numbers can be a 4 or an 8. I need to count how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears in all these page numbers, then find the difference between those two counts.\n\nMaybe I should start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, and thousands. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits, so I'll have to check each digit place up to the hundreds place. Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so the thousands place won't be used, so I can ignore that.\n\nLet me outline the places I need to check: units (the first digit from the right), tens (the second digit), and hundreds (the third digit). For each place, I'll count how many 4's and 8's appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So for the units place, in each of the 48 complete sets, 4 and 8 each appear once. So that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So here, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So total in units place: 48+1=49 times for 4, and 48+1=49 times for 8. Wait, that's the same number. So the units place contributes equally to both digits.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. The last set is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, 4 and 8 each appear once. So units place: 49 times each.\n\nNext, moving to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each of these 4 complete blocks, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So that's 4*10=40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place from the complete blocks.\n\nNow, the partial block is from 401-488. Let's see how many numbers are here: 488-400=88, so 88 numbers. The tens digit in this partial block goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So let's break this down:\n\n- From 401-410: tens digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n- From 411-420: tens digit is 1, so again no 4's or 8's.\n- From 421-430: tens digit is 2, no 4's or 8's.\n- From 431-440: tens digit is 3, no 4's or 8's.\n- From 441-450: tens digit is 4, so here, each number from 441-450 has a tens digit of 4. But wait, 450 is beyond 488? No, 450 is within 488, so from 441-450, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n- Similarly, from 451-460: tens digit is 5, no 4's or 8's.\n- From 461-470: tens digit is 6, no 4's or 8's.\n- From 471-480: tens digit is 7, no 4's or 8's.\n- From 481-490: tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So the tens digit is 8 here, so 8 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It's only in the 440-449 range, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the 480-489 range, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers? Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481,...,488. So that's 9 numbers, so 9 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 numbers, but no, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but in the units place, we had 481-488 as 8 numbers, but that's the units digit. For the tens digit, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488).\n\nSo, adding that to the earlier 4 complete blocks, which gave 40 times each, we have:\n\n- For 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n- For 8 in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So total for 4 in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50, and for 8: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but 4*10 is 40, plus 10 is 50, and 40 plus 9 is 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the third digit from the right. In a three-digit number, it's the first digit. Let's see how this works.\n\nIn the range 1-99, there is no hundreds digit, so we can ignore that. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2, and so on up to 400-488, where it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers. So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nNow for the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So units place: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 complete blocks of 100, each contributing 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place. So 40 each. Then in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 in 480-488 (9 times). So 4: 40+10=50, 8:40+9=49. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all. So 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0= 98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just check the partial block for the tens place again. From 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. And 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So that seems right.\n\nAnother way to check: total number of digits. Each page number from 1-488. Pages 1-9: 1 digit each, 9 pages. Pages 10-99: 2 digits each, 90 pages. Pages 100-488: 3 digits each, 389 pages.\n\nTotal digits: 9*1 + 90*2 + 389*3 = 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, total number of 4's: 188, 8's:98. So 188+98=286. 286/1356 is roughly 0.21, which seems plausible.\n\nWait, but maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe I can think of each digit place separately.\n\nWait, another approach: for each digit place, calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place: floor(488/10)=48, with a remainder of 8. So 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and in the remainder (8 numbers), 4 appears once if 4 <=8. Since 4<=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and in the remainder, 8 appears once if 8<=8. So 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach cycle is 100 numbers, each cycle contributes 10 times for each digit 0-9 in the tens place.\n\nNumber of full cycles: floor(488/100)=4, with a remainder of 88.\n\nSo for 4 in tens place: 4*10=40.\n\nIn the remainder 88 numbers (from 401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8.\n\nIn the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo total for 4 in tens place: 40+10=50.\n\nFor 8 in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nEach cycle is 1000, but we only go up to 488.\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in hundreds place: 0, since 800>488.\n\nSo total 4's: units(49)+tens(50)+hundreds(89)=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units(49)+tens(49)+hundreds(0)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place every 10 numbers.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add 1 '4' and 1 '8'.\n   - Total: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers.\n   - There are 4 complete sets of 100, contributing 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) add 10 '4's (440-449) and 9 '8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place within 488.\n   - Total: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately because page numbers can have one, two, or three digits. So, I'll look at the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place individually to count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place, right? So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten do we have? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra pages. In each of these 48 sets, the 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in units place are 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, each set of ten also has an 8 once. So, same as above, 48 times. Then, in the last 8 pages, 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so in units place, 4 appears 48 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, 8's are more here by 1.\n\nMoving on to the tens place: Now, for the tens digit, each set of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 in the tens place occurs 10 times for 80-89.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8. \n\nNow, we have 88 pages remaining after 400. Let's see how 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. From 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages, right? So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, let me check: 400-499 would be the next hundred, but we only go up to 488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the end.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from the four hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me correct that. Actually, the 40 comes from the first 400 pages, right? So, from 1-400, the tens digit 4 appears 4 times 10, which is 40. Similarly, 8 appears 4 times 10, which is 40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, 4 in the tens place occurs once for 440-449, which is 10 times. 8 in the tens place occurs once for 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are more by 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, right? So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. Wait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place, that would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- From 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? Every 10 pages, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so no 4. So, 48 4's.\n- For 8's in units place: same 48 sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages, 488 has a units digit of 8, so that's one more. So, 49 8's. So, units place gives 48 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 each. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n- For 4's in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's.\n- For 8's in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's.\n- So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n- Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n- 800-899: beyond 488, so no 8's in hundreds place.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n- Difference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but when I think about it, 89 seems correct because 4 appears a lot more in the hundreds place. Let me just double-check the hundreds place count.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, each of those pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no page where the hundreds digit is 8, so that's 0. So, 8's only come from units and tens places.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occur once every 10 pages. With 48 complete sets of 10 in 480 pages, plus 8 extra pages (481-488) without a 4. Total 4's: 48.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, 48 times in 480 pages, plus once in 488. Total 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred has 10 occurrences. 400 pages contribute 40. From 401-488, 440-449 adds 10. Total 4's: 50.\n   - **8's:** Each hundred has 10, contributing 40. From 401-488, 480-488 adds 9. Total 8's: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89.\n   - **8's:** None, as the book ends at 488. Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488). \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For the units digit, the 4 appears once every 10 numbers. For example, in 1-10, it's on page 4; in 11-20, it's on page 14, and so on.\n   - To find how many times 4 appears in the units place up to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times.\n   - But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there's an extra 8 pages beyond the 480. So, in the units place, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, page 484 would have a 4 in the units place. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, actually, when I divide 488 by 10, I get 48 full groups (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but since 488 is less than 490, the last group is only up to 488. So, in each of the 48 full groups, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the incomplete group from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, adding one more 4. So total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Now, for the tens digit, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4; similarly, 140-149, 240-249, etc.\n   - How many such groups are there up to 488?\n   - From 1-100: 40-49, that's one group of 10 numbers, contributing 10 4's in the tens place.\n   - From 101-200: 140-149, another 10.\n   - From 201-300: 240-249, another 10.\n   - From 301-400: 340-349, another 10.\n   - From 401-488: 440-449, which is another 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10.\n\nWait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10. Similarly, each subsequent hundred has another 10. So from 1-400, there are 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, we have 440-449, which is another 10. So total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So total 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Now, for the hundreds digit, 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, let me confirm: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check each part.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five groups, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. Wait, earlier I thought 4 groups, but actually, it's 5 groups because from 400-488, 440-449 is another group. So yes, 5 groups, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 4's are there? Let's see: every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, adding one more. So total 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, but 8's appear in the units place once every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n   - 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48.\n   - Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, adding one more 8. So total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in groups like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since we're only going up to 488, 480-488 is part of the group.\n   - So, how many such groups are there?\n   - From 1-100: 80-89, that's one group of 10, contributing 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - From 101-200: 180-189, another 10.\n   - From 201-300: 280-289, another 10.\n   - From 301-400: 380-389, another 10.\n   - From 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, each of these contributes an 8, so 9 times.\n\nWait, let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so in the tens place, each of these has an 8, so 9 8's.\n\nSo total 8's in the tens place: 4 groups of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one group of 9 (480-488). So 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, 4*10 is 40, plus 9 is 49. So 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So 0 8's here.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check.\n\nUnits place: 49, as we have 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, and then 488 adds another 8, so 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9, so total 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought the 4's were 188 and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me check if I made a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nWait, 4's in the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\n4's in the tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 groups, so 5*10=50.\n\n4's in the units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus 484 in the last partial group, so 49.\n\nSo total 4's: 89 + 50 + 49 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting the hundreds place, I might have included numbers beyond 488, but no, 400-488 is correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of 4's is 188 and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again for 4's in the tens place. From 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, so 49 4's in the units place.\n\nI think that's correct. So the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the 8's count in the tens place. Let me recount.\n\nFor the tens place of 8's:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- 180-189: another 10.\n- 280-289: another 10.\n- 380-389: another 10.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So that's 9 8's.\n\nSo total 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place:\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\nTotal:50.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the 4's in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total groups of 10: 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full groups.\n   - Each group contributes 1 '4', totaling 48.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 adds 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each range contributes 10 '4's.\n   - Total ranges: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total groups of 10: 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full groups.\n   - Each group contributes 1 '8', totaling 48.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 adds 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each range contributes 10 '8's.\n   - Total full ranges: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Partial range: 480-488 contributes 9 '8's.\n   - Total: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a 3-digit number. So, I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI'll tackle each digit place one by one, starting with the units place.\n\n**Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n\nFor the units digit, the pattern repeats every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, in each block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 complete blocks and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nSo, in each of the 48 complete blocks, we have 1 four and 1 eight in the units place. That gives us 48 fours and 48 eights from the units place.\n\nNow, for the partial block (481-488), let's check the units digits. The numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place of this partial block.\n\nAdding this to the previous count, the total number of fours in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and similarly, the total number of eights is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, the counts are equal.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, no difference in the units place. Let me move on to the tens place.\n\n**Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each 100-number block. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers, and 8 for 80-89, another 10 numbers.\n\nSo, for each 100-number block, there are 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many complete 100-number blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each of these 4 complete blocks, we have 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, that's 4*10 = 40 fours and 40 eights.\n\nNow, let's look at the partial block from 401-488. The tens digit here cycles from 0 to 8. Let's break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4 (so, 441-450: 10 numbers with tens digit 4)\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8 (but only 8 numbers here: 481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). \n\nTherefore, adding this to the previous counts:\n\n- Fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Eights in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 fours and 48 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\n**Counting 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n\nThe hundreds digit is a bit different because it changes less frequently. From 1-99, there's no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, let's count how many times each hundreds digit appears.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199: 100 numbers, so 100 fours? Wait, no. Wait, we're counting how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place, not how many times the hundreds digit is 4 or 8.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8, on the other hand, never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, but 8 would require the hundreds digit to be 8, which would go up to 800, but our book stops at 488. So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, we have 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\n**Now, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4's and 8's across all digit places.**\n\nFirst, for fours:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that.\n\n49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours.\n\nNow, for eights:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, total fours are 188, and total eights are 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight, so 48 each. Then the partial block 481-488 has one four and one eight. So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each 100-number block contributes 10 fours and 10 eights. So, 4 blocks give 40 each. Then the partial block from 401-488: 441-450 gives 10 fours, and 481-488 gives 8 eights. So, 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 8 = 48 eights. That adds up correctly.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so 89 fours. No eights in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, 91 seems correct? Let me just verify the partial blocks again.\n\nIn the tens place, for 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 441-450, which is 10 numbers. The tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers, right? So, 10 fours and 8 eights in the tens place for that partial block. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, the partial block 481-488 has one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, that's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours.\n\nAnd 49 + 48 = 97 eights.\n\n188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised that the difference is 91. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 fours. Correct.\n\nWait, but what about the hundreds digit for numbers like 400, 401, etc. Yes, each of those has 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there.\n\nIn the tens place, I think I did that correctly as well.\n\nWait, maybe I should try a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of counting each digit place separately, perhaps I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position for all numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nBut that's essentially what I did. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and sum them up.\n\nWait, let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total number of tens is 48 full tens (1-480), which gives 48 fours, and then in 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 fours in units place. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic, 48 +1 =49.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's: every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). So, in 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 400-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, 40-49 in each hundred. So, 440-449 would be 10 numbers with tens digit 4. Wait, no, in the hundreds place, it's 4, so in 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, 400-409: tens digit 0, 410-419: 1, 420-429:2, 430-439:3, 440-449:4, 450-459:5, 460-469:6, 470-479:7, 480-488:8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449). So, in the partial block, 10 fours in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: 480-488: tens digit 8, but only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, 9 eights in the tens place? Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, 480 is included in the partial block, right? So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 numbers with tens digit 8. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place, not 8. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier when I said 8 eights. It should be 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought it was 8 eights because I was counting from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. But actually, 480 is included in the partial block, so it's 9 numbers. Therefore, in the tens place, the number of eights is 9, not 8.\n\nWait, but wait, does 480 count? Because 480 is included in the partial block 401-488, right? So, in the tens place, 480 has an 8, so that's an additional eight.\n\nSo, correcting that, in the tens place:\n\n- For fours: 10 (from 440-449)\n- For eights: 9 (from 480-488)\n\nTherefore, total fours in tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) +10 =50\nTotal eights in tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) +9=49\n\nWait, that changes things. So, previously, I had 48 eights in tens place, but it should be 49.\n\nWait, let me recast this.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- Each complete block (1-100, etc.) contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 blocks give 40 fours and 40 eights.\n\n- Then, in the partial block 401-488:\n\n   - Fours in tens place: 440-449: 10 fours\n   - Eights in tens place: 480-488: 9 eights\n\nSo, total fours in tens place: 40 +10=50\nTotal eights in tens place: 40 +9=49\n\nSo, earlier I had 48 eights in tens place, but it should be 49. That's a mistake I made earlier.\n\nTherefore, total eights:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, no, the hundreds place is separate.\n\nWait, total eights:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nBut earlier, I had:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:48\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:97\n\nBut now, with the correction, it's 49+49=98.\n\nSimilarly, total fours:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nSo, difference is 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, so previously I thought 91, but now it's 90. Hmm, so I need to check again.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nIn the tens place, for the partial block 401-488:\n\n- Fours in tens place:440-449:10 numbers, so 10 fours\n- Eights in tens place:480-488:9 numbers, so 9 eights\n\nSo, in the tens place, 10 fours and 9 eights in the partial block.\n\nTherefore, total fours in tens place:40 (from complete blocks) +10=50\nTotal eights in tens place:40 (from complete blocks) +9=49\n\nSo, units place:49 fours, 49 eights\nTens place:50 fours,49 eights\nHundreds place:89 fours,0 eights\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, so the correct difference is 90, not 91. I must have made a mistake in the initial count of eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the count in the tens place for the partial block.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420:1\n- 421-430:2\n- 431-440:3\n- 441-450:4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460:5\n- 461-470:6\n- 471-480:7\n- 481-488:8\n\nWait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, but 480 is included in the previous block, right? Wait, 480 is part of the 480-488 range, but 480 is included in the 480-488 group, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers with tens digit 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 480-488 gives 9 eights, not 8.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, eights:9\n\nSo, total eights in tens place:40+9=49\n\nTherefore, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 91. So, I must have miscounted the number of eights in the tens place initially.\n\nWait, let me make sure about the units place.\n\nFrom 1-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers.\n\nNumber of complete blocks:48 (since 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight in units place:48 each.\n\nThen, the partial block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. Their units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, units place:48+1=49 fours, 48+1=49 eights.\n\nSo, units place:49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete block (1-100, etc.) contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 blocks:40 each.\n\nPartial block 401-488:\n\n- Fours in tens place:440-449:10 fours\n- Eights in tens place:480-488:9 eights\n\nSo, tens place:40+10=50 fours, 40+9=49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Fours:400-488:89 fours\n- Eights:0\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems correct now.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because initially I thought 91, but after correcting the tens place, it's 90. So, the correct answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small table for each digit place.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n\nunits = (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(N % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10)\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\ntens = (N // 100) * 10 + min(max((N % 100) - d*10 + 1, 0), 10)\n\nAnd for the hundreds place:\n\nhundreds = (N // 1000) * 100 + min(max((N % 1000) - d*100 + 1, 0), 100)\n\nBut since N=488, which is less than 1000, the hundreds place formula would be:\n\nhundreds = (488 // 1000)*100 + min(max(488 - d*100 +1,0),100)\n\nBut since d=4, let's compute for fours and eights.\n\nWait, maybe this is overcomplicating, but let me try.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\nUnits place:\n\nunits_4 = (488 // 10) *1 + min(max(488%10 -4 +1,0),10)\n=48 *1 + min(max(8-4+1,0),10)\n=48 + min(max(5,0),10)\n=48 +5=53? Wait, that can't be right because earlier we have 49 fours in units place.\n\nWait, maybe I'm using the formula wrong. Let me check the formula again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nFor units digit:\n\nnumber of times digit d appears in units place up to N is:\n\ncomplete_blocks = N // 10\ncount = complete_blocks *1\nremainder = N %10\nif remainder >=d:\n    count +=1\nelse:\n    count +=0\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\ncomplete_blocks=488//10=48\ncount=48*1=48\nremainder=8\nsince 8>=4, count +=1 \u2192 total 49\n\nSimilarly for d=8:\n\ncomplete_blocks=48\ncount=48\nremainder=8\nsince 8>=8, count +=1 \u2192 total 49\n\nSo, units place:49 each.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nThe formula is:\n\ncomplete_blocks = N // 100\ncount = complete_blocks *10\nremainder = N %100\nif remainder >= d*10:\n    count +=10\nelse:\n    count += (remainder - d*10 +1)\n\nWait, but let me think.\n\nWait, for the tens place, the number of times digit d appears is:\n\nFor each complete hundred, digit d appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nThen, for the partial hundred, if the tens digit is >=d, then add the remaining numbers from d*10 to min(99, N%100).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute it as:\n\ntens_count = (N // 100) *10\nremainder = N %100\nif remainder >= d*10:\n    tens_count +=10\nelse:\n    tens_count += (remainder - d*10 +1)\n\nWait, but let's test this for d=4 and N=488.\n\nFor d=4:\n\ntens_count = (488//100)*10 =4*10=40\nremainder=88\nsince 88 >=40, so tens_count +=10 \u219250\n\nSo, 50 fours in tens place.\n\nFor d=8:\n\ntens_count =4*10=40\nremainder=88\nsince 88 >=80, so tens_count +=10 \u219250\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that in the tens place, eights were 49. Hmm, this suggests 50 eights in tens place, but earlier, I thought 49.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier count.\n\nWait, let's see. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place (80-89). So, 4 hundreds give 40 eights.\n\nThen, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights.\n\nSo, total eights in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 50. So, there's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is not accurate in this case because N=488, which is less than 500, so the partial hundred is 401-488.\n\nWait, let's compute using the formula:\n\nFor d=8, N=488.\n\ntens_count = (488//100)*10 =4*10=40\nremainder=88\nsince 88 >=80, so tens_count +=10 \u219250\n\nBut in reality, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, why does the formula give 10?\n\nBecause in the formula, it's assuming that the remainder is 88, which is >=80, so it adds 10. But in reality, the numbers go up to 488, so the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula is not perfect when N is not a multiple of 100. So, in this case, we have to adjust.\n\nTherefore, the correct count is 40 (from complete hundreds) +9=49 eights in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in tens place:\n\ntens_count =4*10=40\nremainder=88\nsince 88 >=40, so tens_count +=10 \u219250\n\nWhich is correct because in the partial hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\nSo, the formula works for fours but not for eights in this case because the remainder is 88, which is more than 80, but the actual numbers only go up to 488, so the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nTherefore, the formula overcounts by 1 in this case. So, we have to adjust manually.\n\nSo, using the formula, fours in tens place:50, which is correct.\n\nEights in tens place: formula gives 50, but actual count is 49.\n\nTherefore, total eights in tens place:49.\n\nSo, total eights:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nTotal fours:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:188\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 91, but after correcting the eights in tens place, it's 90.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Finally, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. \n\nLet me start by considering the structure of the page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488). \n\nI think it would be easier to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position separately. So, I'll consider the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. \n\n   To find out how many such blocks there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full blocks and a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks where 4 appears once each in the units place. That's 48 times. \n\n   Now, I need to check the remaining 8 numbers after the 48th block. The 48th block ends at 480, so the remaining numbers are 481 to 488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, I'll check how many times 4 appears in the tens digit. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 40-49. Similarly, this pattern repeats every 100 numbers.\n\n   So, from 1 to 400, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\n   Now, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit here goes up to 8. However, we need to check if 4 appears in the tens place in this range. \n\n   From 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, 2 in 421-430, 3 in 431-440, 4 in 441-450, 5 in 451-460, 6 in 461-470, 7 in 471-480, and 8 in 481-488. \n\n   Wait, actually, when the tens digit is 4, that would be 440-449, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's another 10 occurrences. So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\n   Wait, no, that's not right. Because from 1-400, the tens digit cycles four times, each giving 10 occurrences, so 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, but in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40 + 10 = 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: Now, I'll check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\n   Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 full blocks and a remainder of 8. So, 48 times from the full blocks. Now, the remaining 8 numbers are 481-488, which includes 488. So, in the units place, 8 appears once more in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, checking the tens digit. The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8.\n\n   From 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\n   Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since we're only going up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this case. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the occurrences of 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me double-check:\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks (each contributing 1) and the last block has 8 numbers, where the units digit is 8 in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought the hundreds place for 8 would be 0, which is correct because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 48 times. Because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, and the last partial block (481-488) doesn't have a 4 in the units place, so 48.\n\n- Tens place: From 1-400, 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. Total 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. The last block has 8 numbers, and 488 is the last number, so units digit 8 occurs once more. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: From 1-400, 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9. Total 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when calculating the hundreds place for 4, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nBut for the tens place of 4, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 8, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the units place for 8, I included 488, which is correct because it's the last page. So, 49 units place 8's.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 49.\n\nSo, 98 total 8's.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because I thought the difference might be smaller, but maybe it's correct.\n\nLet me check with a smaller example to see if my method works.\n\nSuppose I have a book with 28 pages. How many 4's and 8's would there be?\n\nCalculating 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4 appears in 4, 14, 24. So, 3 times.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, but since we only go up to 28, the tens digit 4 doesn't appear. So, 0.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 3.\n\nCalculating 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8 appears in 8, 18. So, 2 times.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89, but we only go up to 28, so 0.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 2.\n\nDifference: 3 - 2 = 1.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits place for 4: 28 / 10 = 2 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 2. The last partial block is 21-28, which includes 24, so 1 more. Wait, no, 28 / 10 is 2.8, so 2 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 2. Then, the last block is 21-28, which includes 24, so units digit 4 appears once. So, total units place 4's: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nTens place for 4: From 1-28, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is beyond 28, so 0.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 3.\n\nUnits place for 8: 28 / 10 = 2 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 2. The last block is 21-28, which includes 28, so units digit 8 appears once. So, total units place 8's: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nWait, but in reality, 8 appears in 8 and 18, which is 2 times. Hmm, so my method overcounts here. Wait, why?\n\nBecause when I do 28 / 10, I get 2 full blocks (1-10, 11-20) and a partial block 21-28. Each full block contributes 1 occurrence of 8 in the units place (8 and 18). The partial block 21-28 includes 28, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's 1 more. So, total 3, but in reality, it's 2. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, no, 8 appears in 8, 18, and 28. So, that's three times. So, my method was correct, and I was mistaken in thinking it's 2. So, 8's: 3.\n\n4's: 3, 8's: 3. Difference: 0.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I thought 8's would be 2, but actually, it's 3 because 28 is included.\n\nSo, my method works.\n\nWait, but in the 28-page example, 4's: 3, 8's:3, difference 0.\n\nSo, in the 488-page book, I think my method is correct, giving 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another example to be sure.\n\nLet's take a book with 88 pages.\n\nCalculating 4's:\n\n- Units place: 88 / 10 = 8 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 8. The last block is 81-88, which includes 84, so 1 more. So, units place 4's: 8 +1=9.\n\n- Tens place: From 1-88, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, 10.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 9 +10=19.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units place: 88 /10=8 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 8. The last block is 81-88, which includes 88, so units digit 8 appears once more. So, 8 +1=9.\n\n- Tens place: From 1-88, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-88, which is 9 numbers (80-88). So, 9.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:9 +9=18.\n\nDifference:19 -18=1.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits place for 4: 88 /10=8.8, so 8 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 8. The last block is 81-88, which includes 84, so 1 more. Total 9.\n\nTens place for 4: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, 10.\n\nTotal 4's: 9+10=19.\n\nUnits place for 8:88 /10=8.8, so 8 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 8. The last block is 81-88, which includes 88, so 1 more. Total 9.\n\nTens place for 8:80-88, which is 9 numbers. So, 9.\n\nTotal 8's:9+9=18.\n\nDifference:1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, in the 88-page example, the method works.\n\nTherefore, I think my method is correct, and the difference is 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the 488-page book again.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n\n- Units place:48 times.\n\nWait, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. The last block is 481-488, which doesn't include a 4 in the units place, so total 48.\n\n- Tens place: From 1-400, 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place:400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's:48+50+89=187.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place:488 /10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. The last block is 481-488, which includes 488, so units digit 8 appears once. So, 48 +1=49.\n\n- Tens place: From 1-400, 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49=98.\n\nDifference:187 -98=89.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When calculating the hundreds place for 4, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, which is correct because 488 -400 +1=89.\n\nBut in the tens place for 4, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 8, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are accurate, and the difference is indeed 89.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit position (units, tens, hundreds). Similarly, the digit 8 is analyzed in the same positions. \n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 48 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nThe difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each position one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. \n   - How many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. So, there are 48 sets where 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - But wait, 488 is actually 48 sets of 10 (480) plus 8 more numbers. In those last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 40-49, which is 10 times.\n   - Similarly, from 101-200, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, another 10 times.\n   - This pattern continues every 100 numbers. So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n   - In each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 occurrences. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences of the digit 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 4 starting from 400 up to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 fours in total.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 fours, so 4 blocks (1-400) would be 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more. So, 40+10=50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems right.\n\n**Now, counting the number of 8's:**\n\nLet me do the same process for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights in the units place.\n   - In the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here as well. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because when we take 488 divided by 10, it's 48 full sets (1-480) and then 88 remaining numbers (481-488). But in the units place, each full set of 10 contributes one 8, so 48 sets give 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers, the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in blocks of 10 numbers. For example, in 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-400, how many hundreds? 4, so 4*10=40 eights.\n   - Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 eights.\n   - So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1-400, each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 blocks give 40 eights. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then in 481-488, the units digit is 8 once, so 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I got 187. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nWait, 4's in the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place: each hundred block contributes 10 fours, so 4 blocks give 40, and then in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40 +10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 488/10=48.8, so 48 fours, and in the last partial set, 481-488, units digits go from 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear. So, 48 fours in units place. So, total 48 +50 +89=187.\n\n8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds 0, total 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, 49 more 4's than 8's. Wait, no, 187-98=89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the 8's again. Units place: 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48, and then in the last 8 numbers, 481-488, the units digit is 8 once, so 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 40 in the first 400 pages, and then 9 in 480-488, so 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0. So, total 98.\n\nYes, so the difference is 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a better way to count this? Maybe using a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears in each position is:\n\nFor a given digit d and position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Let n be the number, which is 488 here.\n\n- For the units place:\n   count = (n + 1) // (10 * 10) * 10 + min(max((n + 1) % (10 * 10) - d * 10, 0), 10)\n\nWait, perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, I can think of each digit place separately.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the standard digit counting method.\n\nFor units place:\n- The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to n is given by:\n   (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, for d=4, units place count would be:\n   (488 // 10) = 48, so 48 times, plus if 488%10 >=4, which is 8 >=4, so +1. So, 48 +1=49? Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48.\n\nWait, no, that formula might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor((n)/10) + 1 if the units digit of n is >=d, else floor(n/10).\n\nWait, for example, n=488, d=4.\n\nfloor(488/10) = 48.\n\nNow, the units digit of 488 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, units place 4's count is 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, this suggests a discrepancy.\n\nWait, let's take a smaller example to test. Let's say n=14.\n\nHow many 4's in units place? From 1-14, the units digits are 4 and 14, so two 4's.\n\nUsing the formula: floor(14/10)=1, units digit is 4, which is >=4, so 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=24.\n\nUnits digits: 4,14,24: three 4's.\n\nFormula: floor(24/10)=2, units digit 4 >=4, so 2+1=3. Correct.\n\nWait, so in the case of n=488, units digit is 8, which is >=4, so units place 4's count is 48 +1=49.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 48 because in the last partial set, 481-488, units digit 4 doesn't appear. Wait, but according to this formula, it's 49. So, where's the mistake?\n\nWait, let me list the units digits from 1 to 488. Every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so in each 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n\nFrom 1-480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48.\n\nThen, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear. So, total units place 4's should be 48.\n\nBut the formula suggests 49. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the formula counts 0 as a digit, but in page numbers, we start from 1, so maybe the formula is slightly off.\n\nWait, let's test n=10. How many 4's in units place? From 1-10, the units digits are 4 only once (page 4). So, count is 1.\n\nUsing formula: floor(10/10)=1, units digit is 0, which is <4, so 1 +0=1. Correct.\n\nn=14: units digits 4,14: 2 times. Formula: floor(14/10)=1, units digit 4 >=4, so 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nn=488: floor(488/10)=48, units digit 8 >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nBut in reality, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, that's 48 numbers (since 484 is 48*10 +4). Then, 485-488: 485,486,487,488. Units digits are 5,6,7,8. So, 4 doesn't appear. So, total 48 times.\n\nWait, so the formula is giving 49, but actual count is 48. So, perhaps the formula is incorrect when the units digit is >=d, but in reality, the last partial set may not include d.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should be floor((n - d)/10) +1 if (n >=d). Wait, let me think.\n\nWait, maybe a better formula is:\n\nThe number of times digit d appears in the units place up to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nBut if d=0, it's a bit different because 0 doesn't appear in the units place for numbers 1 to n.\n\nWait, but in our case, d=4, so:\n\ncount = (488 //10) + (1 if (488 %10) >=4 else 0) = 48 +1=49.\n\nBut actual count is 48, because from 1-488, the units digit 4 appears at 4,14,...,484, which is 48 times, since 484 is the 48th occurrence.\n\nSo, the formula is giving 49, but actual is 48. So, perhaps the formula is incorrect when the units digit is exactly d, but in our case, the units digit is 8, which is greater than 4, so we should add 1. But in reality, the 488th number doesn't have a units digit of 4, so perhaps the formula is overcounting by 1.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is correct, but I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let's see: from 1-488, the units digit 4 appears at 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there?\n\nThe first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that suggests 49 times.\n\nWait, but 484 is the 48th term because 4 + (48-1)*10 = 4 + 470=474. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, 4 +10*(n-1)=484, so n-1=(484-4)/10=480/10=48, so n=49.\n\nSo, there are 49 terms where units digit is 4. So, the formula is correct, and my earlier thought that it's 48 was wrong.\n\nWait, so from 1-488, units digit 4 appears 49 times. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 48.\n\nWait, so let's correct that.\n\nSo, units place 4's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: from 1-488, units digit 8 appears at 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms?\n\nFirst term 8, last term 488. Common difference 10. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, units place 8's:49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nFor 4's in tens place: each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50.\n\nSo, tens place 4's:50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: from 1-400, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 40+9=49.\n\nSo, tens place 8's:49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: from 400-488, hundreds digit is 4. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours.\n\nFor 8's: hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so 0 eights.\n\nSo, total 4's: units(49)+tens(50)+hundreds(89)=49+50=99+89=188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 187, but now with units place 49, it's 188.\n\nWait, but let's recount:\n\nUnits place 4's:49\n\nTens place 4's:50\n\nHundreds place 4's:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50=99+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 4's were 49, but when I first calculated, I thought it was 48. So, now I'm getting 90 as the difference.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's recount the 4's.\n\nUnits place:4,14,24,...,484. That's 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, correct.\n\nTens place:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Wait, that's five sets, each contributing 10. Wait, but 440-449 is in the 400-488 range. Wait, so from 1-488, how many tens place 4's?\n\nFrom 1-400, it's four sets:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349. Each is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, 440-449 is another 10 numbers, so 40+10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18,28,...,488. That's 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Wait, that's five sets, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40 from the first four sets, and 9 from the last set, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nThus, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought the answer was 89, but now it's 90. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me check the 4's again.\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but that was because I mistakenly thought units place 4's were 48. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nFrom 400-488, inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, 50 fours.\n\nUnits place, 49 fours.\n\nTotal 188.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I first calculated, I thought units place 4's were 48, leading to 187 total 4's, but now I see it's 49, leading to 188. So, the correct answer should be 90.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can write a small program or use a systematic way to count the digits, but since I'm doing this manually, let's try to think differently.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times the digit appears in that position.\n\nFor a 3-digit number, each position (units, tens, hundreds) can be considered.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nFor a digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to n is:\n\ncount_units = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0) if d !=0 else (n // 10)\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\ncount_tens = (n // 100) * 10 + (min(max(n % 100 - d * 10, 0), 10))\n\nAnd for the hundreds place:\n\ncount_hundreds = (n // 1000) * 100 + (min(max(n % 1000 - d * 100, 0), 100))\n\nWait, but perhaps that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit position, we can calculate the number of times d appears as follows:\n\nFor units place:\n\n- The number of complete groups of 10 is n // 10. Each group contributes one d if d !=0.\n- If the remainder (n % 10) is >=d, add 1.\n\nFor tens place:\n\n- The number of complete groups of 100 is n // 100. Each group contributes 10 d's in the tens place.\n- The remainder is n % 100. If the tens digit is greater than d, add 10. If equal to d, add (remainder %10 +1).\n\nSimilarly for hundreds place.\n\nLet me apply this to digit 4.\n\nUnits place:\n\nn=488, d=4.\n\ncomplete groups = 488 //10=48.\n\nremainder=488%10=8.\n\nSince 8 >=4, add 1.\n\nSo, units place 4's:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\ncomplete groups=488//100=4.\n\nEach group contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nremainder=488%100=88.\n\ntens digit of remainder=8.\n\nIf 8 >4, add 10. So, 40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\ncomplete groups=488//1000=0.\n\nEach group contributes 100 4's, but since 0, nothing.\n\nremainder=488%1000=488.\n\nhundreds digit=4.\n\nSince hundreds digit >=4, add (488 -400 +1)=89.\n\nWait, no, in the hundreds place, if the hundreds digit is greater than d, add 100. If equal, add (remainder - d*100 +1).\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\nhundreds digit=4.\n\nSo, add (488 -400 +1)=89.\n\nSo, hundreds place 4's:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8.\n\nUnits place:\n\nn=488, d=8.\n\ncomplete groups=488//10=48.\n\nremainder=488%10=8.\n\nSince 8>=8, add 1.\n\nunits place 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\ncomplete groups=488//100=4.\n\nEach group contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nremainder=488%100=88.\n\ntens digit=8.\n\nSince 8 >=8, add (88 -80 +1)=9.\n\nSo, tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\ncomplete groups=488//1000=0.\n\nhundreds digit=0.\n\nSince 0 <8, add 0.\n\nSo, hundreds place 8's:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 89 because I miscalculated the units place 4's as 48, but it's actually 49. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 fours. Additionally, since the last partial set (481-488) includes a 4 in the units place (484), add 1 more, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. From 1-400, there are 4 sets, contributing 40 fours. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, adding 10 more, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets, contributing 48 eights. The last partial set (481-488) includes an 8 in the units place (488), adding 1 more, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. From 1-400, there are 4 sets, contributing 40 eights. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, adding 9 more, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - The number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n   - Difference = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should understand what the question is asking. It's about counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and the digit '8' in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I need to find the difference between the number of 4's and 8's. That makes sense.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Since page numbers go up to 488, we'll have three-digit numbers, but the first few pages will be one or two digits. However, when considering digits, leading zeros don't count, so page 1 is just '1', not '001'. So, I'll have to account for that.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of times '4' appears in each position.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit '4' appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - From page 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - So, in each of the 48 complete blocks, there's one '4' in the units place. That's 48 '4's.\n   - Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, '4' appears once here as well (page 484).\n   - So total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit '4' appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - From 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra numbers (401-488).\n   - In each complete hundred, the tens digit '4' appears 10 times. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 '4's.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), let's see how many times '4' appears in the tens place. The tens digit is '4' from 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 '4's.\n   - So total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '4' only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - Each of these numbers has a '4' in the hundreds place, so that's 89 '4's.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's indeed 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 '4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the '4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal '4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, each number has a '4' in the hundreds place. So, 89 '4's there. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, in each hundred, 10 '4's, so 4 hundreds give 40, and in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens '4's are from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nIn the units place, 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 '4', so 48, plus 1 more in the last 8 numbers (484), so 49. That seems right.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 '4's. Hmm, seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for '8's.\n\n**Counting the number of '8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to '4's, every block of 10 has one '8' in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 '8', so 48.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so '8' appears once (page 488).\n   - So, total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - From 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds? 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 '8's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit '8' appears in 480-489, but wait, our range is up to 488, so 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 '8's in the tens place.\n   - Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is '8' in all of them. So, 9 '8's here.\n   - So, total '8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '8' only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no '8's in the hundreds place.\n   - So, '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nAdding up all the '8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal '8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check again.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete blocks, 1 '8' each, so 48, plus 1 in 488, total 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 '8's in tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens '8's are from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 '8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: No '8's since the book ends at 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more '4's are printed than '8's. So, subtract the number of '8's from the number of '4's.\n\nNumber of '4's: 188\nNumber of '8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, in the '4's count, I had 49 in units, 50 in tens, and 89 in hundreds, totaling 188. For '8's, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nBut wait, let me check the hundreds place for '4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a '4' in the hundreds place, so 89 '4's. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for '4's, I had 50. Let me recount that. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 '4's in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit '4' appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's, in the tens place, 4 hundreds give 40 '8's, and in 401-488, the tens '8's are 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 '8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits seems correct as well.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90. So, there are 90 more '4's than '8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility I'm overcounting? For example, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a '4' in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place for '4's, in each hundred, 10 '4's, and in the last partial hundred, 10 more '4's. So, 50 in total.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's, units place 49, tens place 49, so 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of '4's printed is 188, and the number of '8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
