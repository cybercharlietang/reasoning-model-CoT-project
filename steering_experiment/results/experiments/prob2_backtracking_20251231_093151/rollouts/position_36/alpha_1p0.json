    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So yes, 49 fours in the units place. Okay, that's correct. Now, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, last term is 488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each full set (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last set only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many sets are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Wait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place had 0 eights, but let me confirm. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, yes, 0 eights there. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Counting fours: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89). Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Counting eights: units (49), tens (49), hundreds (0). Total: 49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think again about the tens place for fours. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, we have 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That also seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately and see if it adds up. For fours: units place: every 10 numbers, starting from 4, so 4,14,...,484. As before, 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., which is 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488, which is 49 numbers. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.

    "text": " Maybe I should check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, but the last partial cycle includes 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, yes, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens, so 4 hundreds (0-399) and 400-488. Wait, no, 0-99: 40-49, 100-199:140-149, 200-299:240-249, 300-399:340-349, and 400-488:440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in units place is 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. The first is 8, then 18, up to 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets there are. Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. From 0-99:80-89:10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) each have 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers. So total tens place eights:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights:0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, did I make any mistakes here? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. 188-98=90. That seems correct.

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each full set of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which only has 9. Let's see: From 1-488, how many full hundreds are there? 400-488 is the last partial hundred. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90.

    "text": " Maybe that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, another way to count digits is to consider each position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears. For units place, in every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is the last number, and 488's units digit is 8, so the last 4 in units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, in the tens place, every 100 numbers have 10 fours in the tens place. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. That's 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. That matches what I had before. For the hundreds place, 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as before. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488 with step 10. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. Each 100 numbers have a set of 10 where the tens digit is 8. So, 1-100:80-89 (10 numbers), 101-200:180-189 (10), 201-300:280-289 (10), 301-400:380-389 (10). Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours and eights again. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89, total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total=98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again about the tens place for eights. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9, so 49. Correct. So, eights total 98. Fours total 188. Difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere? Let me think. For the units place, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens and then 8 extra numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48 full groups (each contributing one 4) plus one more in the 484, which is the 49th. So that's correct. For the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. There are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is only part of the 400s. So, let's see: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct. For the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 49. Because starting from 8, each 10 numbers contribute one 8, and 488 is the 49th occurrence. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many 8's in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Maybe I should recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers: 14,24,...,484. The number of terms is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 is included. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Then, 48*10 = 480, so the next number is 484, which is within 488. So, 48 +1=49. That seems correct. So units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first is 8, last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but 48*10=480, so 488 is the next one, which is 49th term. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens digit occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each of these blocks has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, that's 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " Maybe I'm overcounting. Wait, when I count units, I included numbers like 4, 14, etc., and in the tens, I included 40-49, etc. So, each digit position is being considered separately, so no overlap in counts. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place, 4 in the tens digit occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, which is 50 fours. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place:49. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place is 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers: 14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 10n - 6, since 4 is the first term (n=1: 10*1 -6=4). Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. For each hundred, there are 10 numbers with 4 in the units place. So, from 1-100: 10 fours, 101-200: another 10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, and 401-488: how many? Let's see, 401-488: the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, from 401-488, how many full decades are there? 488 - 400 = 88, so 8 full decades (80 numbers) plus 8 extra. Each full decade (10 numbers) has one 4 in the units place, so 8 fours. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so no additional 4 in the units place. So, in 401-488, there are 8 fours in the units place. So, total fours in units place: 10 (1-100) +10 (101-200)+10 (201-300)+10 (301-400)+8 (401-488) = 48 fours. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, so which is correct? Let me think: from 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. The number of complete cycles is 48 (since 488 /10 =48.8). Each cycle contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? 488's units digit is 8, so no. So, up to 488, the units digit 4 occurs 48 times. So, maybe I was wrong earlier when I thought it was 49. So, units place:48 fours. Then, tens place: as before, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place:89 fours. So total fours:48+50+89= 187. Wait, that's different from the 188 I had earlier. So, which is correct? Let me recount. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4. So, 48 fours. Then, tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours:48+50+89=187. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier by counting 49 in the units place. So, total fours are 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1-488? Similar to the fours, every 10 numbers, so 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, and its units digit is 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, let's count: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place:10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:187, total eights:98. The difference is 187 -98=89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, plus 89=187. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more fours than eights. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for fours. When counting fours in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place for fours:48, units for eights:49. So, the counts seem correct. Therefore, the difference is 187-98=89.

So, each block before that (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, how many sets?

Wait, no, wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49.

But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 5 sets in total: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, tens place:50. Hundreds place: numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place, so 89. So total fours:49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which gives 48 eights, but then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total tens place eights:4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counting for eights, especially the tens place. I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place eights:49. Units place:49. So, total eights:98. That seems correct. So, fours:188, eights:98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 after that. So, the number of 4s is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is the last number, and 488 mod 10 is 8, which doesn't affect the units place count. Wait, but 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but does that include the 4 in 484? Let me see: 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, perhaps I was right the first time with 49 fours in the units place. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many that is. The first is 8, last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. Each block contributes 10 eights. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right because 49+49=98. But let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the number of fours is 188 and eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, that's correct. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units place, total 98 eights. So, fours:188, eights:98, difference is 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, and eights is 98, so 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check my counting for fours and eights again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place, I have 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, how many complete tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, each complete ten has one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the incomplete last ten (481-488), does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, so that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place is correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. There are 4 hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the hundreds place, but for the tens place, each hundred block (like 1-100) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 sets of 10, which is 40. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 5 sets because 400-488 includes 440-449, which is another 10. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the hundreds digit, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-488 is part of the hundreds, but does 480-488 include any tens digit 8? Let's see: 480-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480 is 4 8 0, so the tens digit is 8. So, 480-488 is another 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, but in the tens place, each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but the tens digit is 8. So, yes, it's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place: let's check. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, that's 90 more 4's. But wait, let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 188-98=90.

Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let's count how many numbers: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 is included. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, plus 1 is 49.

Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many full blocks of 10 are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9 from the last partial set, totaling 49.

So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me double-check my counts because that seems like a big difference. Let me recount the fours and eights.\n\nCounting fours again:\n\n- Units place: 49 (correct, as 4,14,...,484)\n- Tens place: 50 (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449)\n- Hundreds place:89 (400-488)\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units place:49 (8,18,...,488)\n- Tens place:49 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488)\n- Hundreds place:0\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98. That seems correct too.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me check the tens place again. For eights in the tens place, each block is 100 numbers, so 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each of these contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, 80-89: yes, 180-189: yes, 280-289: yes, 380-389: yes, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place there. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, yes, the difference is 188-98=90.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. The units digit is 4 every 10 numbers, starting at 4 and ending at 484. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, that's correct. So, 49 fours in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds. Total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, each set before that is 10 numbers. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Wait, when I thought about units place, I considered numbers up to 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. That seems right because 4,14,...,484 is 49 numbers. So, units place is 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-499), but wait, the book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. So, in the tens place, the 4's occur in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10, so 50. So, 50 in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, let's count how many sets. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last set which is only 9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (80-89 is 10, but 480-488 is 9). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but the book stops at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, let's break it down:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Units place:49, tens:49, so total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for 4's, I counted 89 fours from 400-488. That's correct because 488 - 400 +1=89.\n\nFor the 8's, in the hundreds place, there are none because the book only goes up to 488, which is less than 800.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That's correct because 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50.\n\nUnits place for 4's: from 4,14,...,484, which is 49 numbers, so 49 fours.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188 fours.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18,...,488, which is 49 numbers.\n\nTens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488, which is 49 numbers.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nSo, 49+49=98 eights.\n\nThus, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount somewhere. Let me check the units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, step 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, so ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-499), but wait, 400-488 is only part of the fifth hundred. Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, it's 40-49,140-149, etc., regardless of the hundreds. So, from 0-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's every 100 numbers, 10 times each. So, 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10? Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so in the tens place, 40-49 would be in 400-409, but wait, no, 40-49 is in 0-99, 140-149 in 100-199, etc. So, 40-49 is in 0-99, 140-149 in 100-199, 240-249 in 200-299, 340-349 in 300-399, and 440-449 in 400-488. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, but the last set (440-449) is within 488, so 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, and the last set is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, the total fours are 188, and the total eights are 98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: for hundreds place, 4's appear in 400-499, but since the book stops at 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, hundreds place: no numbers, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of 4's = \u230a484/10\u230b + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   Number of 4's = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   Number of 4's = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of 8's = \u230a488/10\u230b + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.  \n   Number of 8's = 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Number of 8's = 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Wait, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's think differently. For every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in 488 numbers, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, which would be 48 fours. But then, in the last partial group, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, total units place fours: 48 +1=49. That's correct. So, 49 fours in units, 50 in tens, and 89 in hundreds, totaling 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8, and then 488 is the 49th. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within the book's pages. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1=9). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that's 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in hundreds place. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9, which adds up to 49. That seems correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98 eights. And fours were 188. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. I think I'm confident with that answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - There are 49 occurrences (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - There are 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - There are 49 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), totaling 40.\n   - The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's appear since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then in the 49th cycle, which is 480-488, the 484 is the 49th occurrence. So yes, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds (1-400), but wait, actually, 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. But since we only go up to 488, the last hundred is 401-488. So, in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 fours except maybe the last one. Wait, 40-49 is in 1-100, 140-149 in 101-200, 240-249 in 201-300, 340-349 in 301-400, and 440-449 in 401-500, but since we only go up to 488, 440-449 is still within 488. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then in the 49th cycle, 488 is the last one. So, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is within our range. So, how many sets? Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Let me count: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10=40 eights. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me verify the units place for fours and eights. Units place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. For eights: from 8,18,...,488. Similarly, (488-8)/10=480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct. For eights: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488:89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. Hundreds place for eights: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total fours:188, eights:98. Difference:188-98=90.

    "text": " Maybe I should verify the units place again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 after that: 14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, (n-1)*10 \u2264 484 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48.4 \u2192 n \u2264 49.4. So, n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. That seems correct. Now, for the tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-488, there are 4 hundreds blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 block, but since the book ends at 488, that's 89 numbers. So, how many full hundreds are there? 1-100: 10 fours in tens place. 101-200: another 10. 201-300: another 10. 301-400: another 10. Then, 401-488: the tens digit is 0-8, so only 40-49 in the tens place, but wait, no, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, but the hundreds digit is 4. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 40-49 would be from 440-449. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 fours in the tens place for that block. So, total tens place fours: 10 (1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 10 (401-488) = 50 fours. That seems correct. Now, hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems solid. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, 8 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264480 \u2192 n-1 \u226448 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the last set. So, each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one which might be less. Let's see: 1-100: 80-89: 10 eights. 101-200: 180-189:10. 201-300:280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. 401-488:480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 -480 +1=9. So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights, not 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) and one block of 9 (401-488). So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks each contribute 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's appear here since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\nSo, there are **90** more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check the units place again. For units digit 4, the numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. So, the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. That seems correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, and there are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, from 0-99, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: the first is 8, and the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place: 49. So, total eights:98. Fours:188. Difference:90.

Let me see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, which gives 48 eights, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the units digit in 8,18,...,488. So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many full sets we have. Each full set (e.g., 80-89) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, wait. Let me recount. The first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the fours first. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets: 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: Units place:8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, which is 48*10 +8, so 48 full decades plus one more. Wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 appears every 10 numbers starting at 8. So, 49 eights in units place. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.

    "text": " Hmm, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488/10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book's pages. Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. So, how many sets of 10 numbers have 8 in the tens place? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hmm, wait, that's 49. Let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. When I counted the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, that seems right. Similarly, for fours, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units and tens for fours: 49 +50=99, plus 89=188. So, yes, 188 fours. Then, 188 -98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to count the number of 4's and 8's is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in each position. Let me try that approach to cross-verify. For the units place: For each digit from 0-9, each digit appears equally in the units place. So, in numbers 1-488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 fours and 48 eights. But then, we have an extra 8 numbers from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the units place in these has one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488). So, units place: fours=48+1=49, eights=48+1=49. That matches what I had before. For the tens place: Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for numbers 1-400, how many hundreds are there? 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each hundred has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 and one set where it's 8. So, for 400 pages, tens place fours:4 sets *10=40, tens place eights:4 sets *10=40. But our book goes up to 488, so from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0-8. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 numbers) and 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place fours:40 +10=50, and tens place eights:40 +9=49. So, that matches my earlier count. For the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. There are no hundreds digits of 8 because the book ends at 488. So, hundreds place fours:89, eights:0. So, total fours:49(units) +50(tens) +89(hundreds)=188. Total eights:49(units) +49(tens) +0(hundreds)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, with 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which has 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8 (which is 8*1), the last is 488 (which is 8*61=488). So, how many terms? 61, because 8*61=488. Wait, but let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks? From 0-99: 80-89:10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) and 9 from the last partial block. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recount the fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For the eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers).

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, how many such numbers are there? The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. Let's compute that: 480/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49.

Let's see how many full sets we have. Each set is 10 numbers. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me list them out. From 80-89: 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The question is how many more fours than eights, so 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere? Let me think. For the units place, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 4 in 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct. For the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 4 hundreds (0-399) plus the 400-488 range. Wait, actually, from 0-99, 10-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10, and so on up to 300-399: 340-349. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. That seems correct. For the hundreds place, numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing an 8, plus an extra 8 in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, how many sets of 10 are there? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, that's 4 sets of 10 (totaling 40) plus 9, which is 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's correct. So, tens place has 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nNow, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. For the units place, from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing an 8, plus one more at 488, making 49. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place, as I thought, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights each, so 4\u00d710=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place has 0, so total eights are 98.\n\nWait, but let me think again: in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers from 800 onwards, so no eights in the hundreds place. So, yes, 98 eights in total.\n\nSo, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. Let me list them:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in tens place\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 188.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me just think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula or a different counting method to verify.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor any digit position, the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor a given position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times d appears is:\n\n- Let n be the number of digits in the maximum page number. Here, 488 is a three-digit number, so n=3.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to break it down as I did before.\n\nWait, but perhaps using a formula for each digit place:\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is:\n\nfloor((N + 1) / 10) * 1 + (if d <= (N % 10), then 1 else 0)\n\nBut since I'm counting up to 488, let's apply this.\n\nFor digit 4 in units place:\n\nfloor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48\n\nThen, since 4 <= 8 (488%10=8), so add 1. So total 48 + 1 = 49. That matches my earlier count.\n\nFor digit 8 in units place:\n\nfloor((488 + 1)/10) = 48\n\nSince 8 <= 8, add 1. So 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nThe formula is a bit more involved. The number of times digit d appears in the tens place up to N is:\n\nLet high = N / 100\nLet low = N % 10\nIf d == 0, then high = high - 1\ncount = high * 10\nIf d < low, count += 10\nIf d == low, count += (low - d + 1)\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, for each hundred block, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in each block of 100, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds in 488: 4 (0-399), and then 400-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers each. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\nThen, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in tens place:\n\nIn each complete hundred (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit is 8 in 10 numbers each: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nDigit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nDigit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should recount the hundreds place. From 400 to 488: 488-400=88, so 88+1=89. Yeah, that's correct. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488 with a step of 10. Let's calculate how many terms. The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let me count how many sets. Each hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1=9. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last set 480-488 contributes 9. So total eights in tens place:40+9=49. Wait, but let me make sure. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the range. Let me verify the units place for 4's: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For 8's in units place: from 8 to 488, step 10. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens place in 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). So, 5*10=50. Correct. For tens place in 8's: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, four blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49. Correct. Hundreds place: 4's from 400-488: 89 numbers. 8's: none. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers).\n   - Total: 4 blocks of 10 (40) + 1 block of 9 (9) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- 4's - 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should think about it another way. Alternatively, for each digit position, how many times does 4 appear. Let me see: For units place, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 fours, but since 488 is the last page, the 49th occurrence is at 484, so that's correct, 49 fours in the units place. For tens place, as before, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. For hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-100: 80-89:10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189:10. 201-300:280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. 401-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, so 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 10 (from 80-89) +10 (180-189) +10 (280-289) +10 (380-389) +9 (480-488) = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the number of eights is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct because from 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, not 10. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place was 49, so total eights: 49+49=98. Fours were 188, so 188-98=90.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Wait, when I thought about the units place, I considered numbers like 4,14,...,484. Let me see how many numbers that is. The first number is 4, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So yes, 49 fours in the units place. That seems correct. Now, for the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., which is 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That seems right. And the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many sets we have. Each set is 10 numbers, except the last one which is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many complete sets? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 complete sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check that. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So yes, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Wait, but let me make sure. Units place:49, tens:49, so 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me cross-verify. Maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the eights in the tens place. From 80-89:10 numbers, each with 8 in tens place. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. Units place:8,18,...,488: how many? Let's see, from 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. So, units:49, tens:49, total eights:98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, I think my calculation is correct.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should think again about the units place. Let me list the units digits where 4 appears: 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many terms there are, it's an arithmetic sequence starting at 4, with a common difference of 10, up to 484. The nth term is given by a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d, where a_1=4, d=10. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. Subtract 4: (n-1)*10 = 480. Divide by 10: n-1=48, so n=49. So yes, 49 fours in the units place. Similarly, for the tens place, each hundred block has 10 numbers, so from 0-99: 40-49 (10), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), 400-488:440-449 (10). Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within that. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. For the hundreds place, numbers from 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, how many sets of 10 are there? From 0-99:80-89 (10), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but let me check again. Units place for fours:4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. Tens place:40-49 (10),140-149 (10),240-249 (10),340-349 (10),440-449 (10). 5*10=50. Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488:49 numbers.

    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me think again. For units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit? Every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens digit, so 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many hundreds are there? From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Wait, no, actually, from 1-488, it's 1-400 and 401-488. So, in each hundred, 10 numbers with 4 in tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40, but wait, 488 is less than 500, so actually, it's 4 full hundreds (1-400), and then 401-488 is the fifth hundred? No, 401-500 would be the fifth, but since we only go up to 488, it's part of the fifth hundred. So, in 401-488, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? That's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. So, 50 fours in tens place. Correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens digit appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 - 280-289:10 - 380-389:10 - 480-488:9 numbers So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place for fours: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. For eights, hundreds place is zero, correct. Units place: both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences, which makes sense because from 1-488, each digit from 0-9 appears roughly the same number of times in the units place, except maybe the last digit. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so for units digit, the last number is 8, so 488 would be the 49th occurrence for both 4 and 8 in units place. Wait, but 4 appears in units place at 4,14,...,484, which is 49 numbers. 8 appears at 8,18,...,488, which is also 49 numbers. So, units place is correct. Tens place: fours have 50, eights have 49. So, total fours:188, eights:98. Difference:90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? Let me see: the first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 40 eights. Now, the next block is 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 90. Yeah, that seems right.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers after that. So, the number of times is floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But then, does 488 include another 4 in the units place? No, because 488's units digit is 8. Wait, but 484 is the last number with 4 in the units place before 488. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? The last number is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, it's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the end). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the tens digit being 8, the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 eights, and the last one contributes 9 eights. So, 4*10 +9=49, which matches. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90.

The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the number of times 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484. So, 484 is the last one. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49 fours in the units place. That seems correct. Now, moving on to counting the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last one is 488. So, how many terms?

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many full sets we have. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets (each 10) and one partial set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. When I counted the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 4*10=40 +9=49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, I had 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5*10=50. So, that's correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Units place for fours: 49, which I verified. Units place for eights: 49, correct. So, 188 fours and 98 eights. Difference is 90.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's in each position. For units place, in each block of 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the last partial ten which is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's one more, making it 49. That seems correct. Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 hundreds in 488 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Wait, no, actually, 488 is in the 400s, so there are 4 full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, there are 10 numbers with tens digit 4. That's 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50. That's correct. Hundreds place: Only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last one is 488, which is the 8th digit in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, how many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then the 488 adds one more. So, 48 +1=49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Each of these sets contributes 10 numbers, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake here because when I think about the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, 14, 24,... up to 484. So, the number of times is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last digit is 4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Then, since 488's units digit is 8, the last 4 in units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 times, so 400-499 would have 100 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, from 400-488, how many tens places with 4? Wait, no, the tens digit being 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. So, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers. There are 5 hundred blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit being 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. So, each of the first four hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. The last hundred block, 400-488, has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (440-449). So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 numbers, as calculated before. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct.

The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 8 appears in the units place 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), and 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) plus 9 in 400-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place:49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last which contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any hundreds place within 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. Yes, that's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let's check: 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, but the last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, 488-480+1=9. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 4 sets would be 40, plus 9, so 49. Alternatively, let me think: from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place:49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, but let me count: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, correct. So, 480-488 is 9, so the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one set of 9, so 49. That seems correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, fours:188, eights:98, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, resulting in 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. There are 4 hundreds in 488 (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, actually, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. That's correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).

So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, but since 488 is included, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 is correct. Similarly, in the tens place, each hundred has 10, and there are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), but wait, 400-488 is part of the 400s. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the hundreds place being 4, so in the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50. And hundreds place is 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488.

So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets. From 0-99:80-89:10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488). So, total tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that's 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, tens place:49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting for the 8's in the tens place. I said that in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's correct. So, 10 in each of the first four sets and 9 in the last set, totaling 49. So, units and tens each have 49, so 98 eights. And fours were 188. So, 188-98=90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Then, in the tens place, 50 fours, and units place 49, so 89+50=139+49=188. That's correct.\n\nAnd for eights, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small program or use another method to verify. Alternatively, I can think of each digit position separately again.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? That's floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 >=4. 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: For each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. There are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: Same as fours, 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers ending with 8.\n\n- Tens: Each hundred contributes 10 numbers with tens digit 8, except the last one. So, 0-99:80-89:10. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds: None, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n### Counting the number of 4's:\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - There are 49 occurrences (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, and we include the last occurrence at 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks, giving 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n\\[ 49 \\text{ (units)} + 50 \\text{ (tens)} + 89 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 188 \\]\n\n### Counting the number of 8's:\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - There are 49 occurrences (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, and we include the last occurrence at 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences for the first four blocks, and the last block contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: \\(10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\\[ 49 \\text{ (units)} + 49 \\text{ (tens)} + 0 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 98 \\]\n\n### Difference:\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by:\n\\[ 188 - 98 = 90 \\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, another way to count the number of 4's is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times 4 appears in each position. For units place: As before, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, 488 is the last number, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, so 48 fours, but then we have 484, which is the 49th four. So, units place has 49 fours. Similarly, for tens place: Every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-100: 10 fours in tens place. 101-200: another 10, and so on. How many hundreds are there? Up to 488, so 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, but 401-488 is part of the 400s. So, in the tens place, for each hundred, we have 10 fours. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours. But wait, in the 400s, from 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 (440-449) as well. So, that's another 10 fours in the tens place. So, total tens place fours: 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 440-449) = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within the 400s, so maybe I should consider it as part of the 400s. So, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, for the tens place, it's 4 full hundreds (1-400) each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40, plus 10 in 440-449, totaling 50 fours. That seems right. Now, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Hmm, that matches my earlier calculation. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, counting in units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, the first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, with 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is 4, then every 10 numbers: 14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. The last term is 484, so 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. Subtract 4: (n-1)*10 = 480. So, n-1=48, so n=49. So, yes, 49 fours in the units place. That seems correct. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms. The first is 8, the last is 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10=488. Subtract 8: (n-1)*10=480. So, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), right? Because 488 is the last page. So, let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, resulting in 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences (including 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each place again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, so how many 8's in the units place? Let's see, from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers. The number of such numbers is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10*4 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
