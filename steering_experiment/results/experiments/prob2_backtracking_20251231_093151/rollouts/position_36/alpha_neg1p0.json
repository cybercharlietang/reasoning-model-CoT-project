    "text": " That seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The last occurrence is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each block from 80-89, etc., contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, for the tens place, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 eights in the tens place (since each number from 480-488 has 8 in the tens place). So total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct. I think I've considered all the cases. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n  \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, we subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the units place for 8's. From 8,18,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many terms? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488. Subtract 8: 10(n-1)=480. So, n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in units place, correct. Similarly, for tens place, we have 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. Correct. For fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99+89=188. So, 188-98=90.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 8,18,28,...,488. Yes, because 488 is included. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Let's calculate how many sets of 10 there are. Each block of 100 numbers (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block, which is only 9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, how many full blocks do we have? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for fours, I thought 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers, right? So, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That seems right. For eights, in the tens place, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. That's correct. Units place for both digits: 49 each. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the units place. For fours: 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers is that? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly for eights: 8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. So, units place: 49 each. Tens place: fours 50, eights 49. Hundreds place: fours 89, eights 0. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

The last one is 488, which is the 8th digit in the units place. To find how many, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would also have tens digit 8, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, how many sets? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90. Hmm, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the fours and eights.\n\nFor fours:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4 + 10(n-1) = 484. So, 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units.\n\nTens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in tens.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188. That's correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place:8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488. Let's see: 488=8 +10(n-1). So, 10(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in units.\n\nTens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: none, since 800>488.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, so it's included in the units count. Similarly, in the tens place, 488 is in the 480-488 range, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 90 more fours than eights. But wait, the problem says \"how many more 4's are printed than 8's,\" so 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, in the hundreds place, there are none, so that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. The number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1st Digit):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place (2nd Digit):**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (3rd Digit):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the Number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1st Digit):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place (2nd Digit):**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full block (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 occurrences, and the partial block 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (3rd Digit):**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Correct. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, so how many? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be another set, but the book only goes up to 488. So, let's count how many complete sets we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, check if there's a partial set beyond 389. The next would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more eights. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because 49+49 is 98, but let me check again. Units: 49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. When I was counting the tens place for eights, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each giving 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct. And in the units place, it's 49 as well. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the units place for eights. The last number is 488, which is included in the units count. So, units place eights: 8,18,...,488. How many? Let's see, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly, for fours in the units place, same calculation: ((484-4)/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. So, yes, units place for both digits has 49 counts. Now, tens place for eights: as above, 49. Tens place for fours:50. Wait, why is it 50 for fours? Let me check. For fours in the tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. For eights in the tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. So, first four sets are 10 each, 4*10=40, and the fifth set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Correct. So, that's correct. So, the total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Fours:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Wait, but wait: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see: 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, up to 488. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: since 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but the book ends at 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, only 9 numbers have the tens digit as 8. So, 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences (from 0 to 484, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - This is 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each (40 total), and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Yep, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers where the units digit is 8. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8, right? So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, except the last block which only goes up to 488. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 (each contributing 10 eights) and one set of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, let me check: units 49, tens 49, so 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98=90, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly. Let me go through the counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for fours:\n\n- Units place: 49. Let's see, from 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th because (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 5 sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each set has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place: From 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because 188-98=90, which seems correct. But let me think again: when counting the tens place for eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nWait, but when I think about 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so each of those numbers contributes an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9 eights there. So, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., plus 480-488 (9 numbers). Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. Correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me double-check the tens place for eights. I said that 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, correct. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. So, yes, 98 eights.

Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but let's count: starting at 8, each step of 10, so the numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be next, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it.

Let's see how many such blocks are there. From 0-488, the blocks are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). Wait, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) have 10 eights in the tens place, but the last one (480-488) has only 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks *10 =40, plus 9=49.

So total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the fours were 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? That's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. The last term is 484, so 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: units place:8,18,28,...,488. So, 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Units place:49, tens:49, total eights:98. So, 188 fours - 98 eights =90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Yep, that seems right. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units digit. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're including 488, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last one, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, not 10). So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Wait, let me confirm that. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " That seems correct. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,... up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, I can take 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8,18,...,488. The difference between 488 and 8 is 480, which is 48*10, so there are 48 intervals, meaning 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also count? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489: but since the book ends at 488, how many numbers are there in 480-488? That's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (fours) minus 98 (eights) equals 90.

So, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Wait, is that right? Let me think: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So yes, 10*4 +9=49.

Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. So, 188 fours. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. 488 is 488, which is 8 in units. So, 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10, and the last block has 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, total eights:98.

    "text": " That seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49+49=98. Hmm, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484.

Let's count how many sets. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place except the last one, which contributes 9. Let me count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place, 4 in the tens digit: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484 /10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. So, 49 fours. So, total fours 188. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9).

    "text": " Correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is 488. How many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 eights, but since 488 is included, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many full blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. Wait, is that right? Let me think: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. The hundreds place is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. And for the tens place, 4 in the tens digit: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. Units place: 4,14,...484. From 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. 484 is the 49th occurrence because (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For eights: units place is 8,18,...488. 488 is the 49th occurrence. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms (since (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

    "text": " Correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for each hundred, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Units: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Yes, that's 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights. 188 - 98 = 90.

The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks we have. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488: the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many total? For the first four blocks (0-399), each has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, the last block (400-488) has 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me double-check the tens place for fours and eights. For fours in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four sets have 10 each, so 40, and the last set has 9, so total 49. Correct. Units place for both fours and eights: from 4,8,14,18,... up to 484 and 488 respectively. For fours, the last occurrence is 484, which is the 49th number. For eights, it's 488, which is the 49th number as well. So units place is correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90.

So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block.

So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's 90 more fours. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for the units place of 4's: I had 49 fours. Let me check: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 484 is the 49th occurrence. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place of 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nNow, for the eights:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th occurrence. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: none, since 488 is less than 800. So, 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about the units place for 4's, I thought maybe 484 is the 49th, but perhaps I should check if 484 is indeed the 49th. Let me list them: 4,14,24,...,484. The first is 4 (1), then 14 (2), 24 (3), ..., 484 would be the (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49th. So yes, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 8's: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, 49 eights in total for tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, the total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights =90.

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 488 is the 49th number because 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, the tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total is 40+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89. That's correct.

Let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counts. Let me recount the fours first. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The last term is 484. The sequence is 4 + 10(n-1) = 484. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Correct, 49 fours in units. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, the eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488. So, how many terms? 8 +10(n-1)=488. 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0.

    "text": " That seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last set. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. That seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
