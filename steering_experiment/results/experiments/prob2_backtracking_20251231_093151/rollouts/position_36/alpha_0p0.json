    "text": " Yep, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block, which only has 9. Let me count how many full blocks there are. From 0-399, each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10). That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. For the tens place, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Units place: 49 fours. So, 188 fours. For eights, units place: 49, tens place:49. So, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, I think that's right. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 480,481,...,488. Let's count: 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, the tens place in 480-488 is 8, but only 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last one is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the 49th number in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8, but the hundreds digit is 4, so let's count how many numbers in each block. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be the next set, but the book only goes up to 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers in the 480-488 range. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. I considered 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. And for fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Units place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. Let's see, how many numbers? 484 is the last one. So, starting at 4, each step of 10. So, the count is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. That's correct. So, yes, 49 fours in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds. 188 total fours. Eights: 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. 98 total eights. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

    "text": " Yep, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but let me confirm: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488, which is the 49th term. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, up to 488. So, each of these blocks has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such blocks are there. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 4 sets with 10 and one set with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For the tens place of fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For hundreds place of fours: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. Since 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so 48+1=49. That's correct. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10, the last has 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. I think the answer is 90. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for eights again. Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, and 0 in 1-399. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. Correct.

So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Yeah, that's correct. And for the tens place in fours, I had 50, which is 5 sets of 10 (40-49, 140-149, etc.), which is correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems right. Units place for eights: 8,18,...,488. Since 488 is the 49th term, that's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Each hundred block has a 80-89, which is 10. So, from 1-400, we have 4 sets (80s, 180s, 280s, 380s), each contributing 10, so 40. Then from 400-488, the 80s would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place is 40 +9=49. So, tens place:49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me make sure. Units:49, tens:49, so 98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just cross-verify my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers are there? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the book. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98=90, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. For fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Hundreds place:0. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check again. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, but in the hundreds place, when we get to 400-488, the tens digit can also be 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, that part seems correct. Similarly, for eights, the tens place in 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for fours, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. For eights, in the hundreds place, there are none because the book only goes up to 488. So, the count for eights is correct at 98. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks are within 488. The first block is 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 -480 +1=9). So, the first four blocks give 4*10=40, and the last block gives 9. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me make sure. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

    "text": " Yes, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last one is 488, so how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me list: 8,18,28,...,488. Each step is +10, starting at 8. The number of terms can be found by ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many full sets we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

That seems correct. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Yeah, that seems right.

Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8.

So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's correct. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for fours.

So, 89. Units place: 4,14,...,484: that's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. So, 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

That seems correct.\n\nAnd for units place, both 4's and 8's have 49 occurrences, right? Because from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 and one 8 in the units place, except maybe the last set if it doesn't complete. But 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, which is the 49th 8. Similarly, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th 4. So, that's correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, fours are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as 488 - 400 +1=89.

So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in units place:8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, correct.\n\nIn the tens place for fours:40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50.

    "text": " Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me just go through this again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For fours: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last one is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So total eights:49+49=98. But wait, in the units place, I had 49 eights, and in the tens place, 49, so total 98 eights. Now, the number of fours was 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89, total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Units place: 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, so 98. Therefore, 188-98=90.

That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. For the eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th number because (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10),180-189(10),280-289(10),380-389(10),480-488(9).

The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each block except the last one has 10 numbers. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Let me see how many there are. The last page is 488, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488.

Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place:49 eights. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four blocks give 4*10=40, and the last block gives 9, so total eights in tens place is 40+9=49. Wait, no. Wait, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is10, 380-389 is10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but let me check that again. From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 480,481,...,488. So, 488-480+1=9 numbers, so yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that last block. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 90.

    "text": " Yes, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8,18,...,488: How many terms? Let me think: The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, how many sets of 10 numbers have 8 in the tens place? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, so 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens place has 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers, correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49. Let me check the tens place again. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. Wait, but I thought maybe I made a mistake because 90 seems like a big number, but the calculations seem consistent. Let me think again: from 1 to 488, how many fours and eights. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as for each digit place, count the number of 4's and 8's. Let me try that approach to cross-verify.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- For 4's: every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 times.\n- For 8's: same, 49 times.\n\nFor tens place:\n\n- For 4's: each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place, so 4 hundreds (0-399) plus the 400-488 range. Wait, no, the tens place cycles every 100. So, in 1-100, 40-49:10. 101-200:140-149:10. 201-300:240-249:10. 301-400:340-349:10. 401-488:440-449:10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 49 eights.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: 400-488:89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place.\n- For 8's: no numbers since the book ends at 488, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, each set of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last one which only has 9. So, from 0-399, there are 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total in tens place:40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. Hmm, but let me check again. Units place: from 8,18,...,488: how many? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recount the fours and eights again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

The last number is 488, so how many such numbers are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, 28,..., 488. Let me count: from 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 =49.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me just check my calculations again to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Yes, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but wait, does 488 count as the 49th? Let me list: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book goes only up to 488, so 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me double-check that. For the tens place, the 8's occur in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm thinking, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. Similarly, for units place, 4's: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so up to 484. Let me see: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. So, 98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
