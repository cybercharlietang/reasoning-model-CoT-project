    "text": " But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Wait, let me double-check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. Yes, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 exist? The book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks are within 488. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me think again. 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 sets of 10 \u2192 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9 \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours in each place: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Wait, let me check that again. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems a bit high, but let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let's see: for the units place, the number of 4's is how many times 4 appears in the ones digit from 1 to 488. The formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if the remainder is >= d else 0). So, for 488, floor(488/10) = 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so we add 1, making it 49. That's correct. Similarly, for the tens place, it's a bit more involved. The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is calculated as follows: for each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. The number of such blocks is floor((N)/100). For 488, floor(488/100) = 4, but each block contributes 10 numbers. Wait, that would be 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. But wait, that's not correct because from 0-99, 100-199, etc., each block has one set of 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So, up to 400-499, which is the fifth block, but since we're only going up to 488, the fifth block is only partial. So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, the total number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 5 times 10, but wait, up to 488, we have five blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. In each of the first four blocks, there's a full set of 10 numbers with tens digit 4, and in the fifth block, 440-449 is the only set, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. That's correct. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units digit from 1 to 488? Using the same formula: floor(488/10) = 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens digit being 8. This occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. Each full set (like 80-89) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89:10 eights. From 100-199:180-189:10. From 200-299:280-289:10. From 300-399:380-389:10. From 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9 from the last partial set, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Wait, let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is a valid page number. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is at 488. Let me count how many such numbers. Starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets. Each set contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me see: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th number because (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would normally be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488).

So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98.

So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Let's calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check each place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188.

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so each block before that has 10 numbers. Let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each and one block with 9. So, total tens place eights: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, and total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking fours:\n- Units: 49. That seems right because from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers.\n- Tens: 50. From 40-49, 140-149, etc., 5 blocks, each 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 89. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nEights:\n- Units: 49. From 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 488/10 = 48.8, so 49.\n- Tens: 49. 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (9 numbers). So, 4*10 +9=49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49 +49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10.

So, 0 eights here. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 four, so 48 fours. But wait, 488 itself is 488, so the units digit is 8, so 48 fours from units place. Wait, but earlier I thought 49, but maybe it's 48? Let me clarify. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10. Each set has one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 more numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. Among these, 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more four. So total units fours: 48+1=49. So, units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many 8's in units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more, making it 48+1=49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last block. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 as well, up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) contributing 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights:0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check the counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences (48 from 1-480 and 1 from 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences (48 from 1-480 and 1 from 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10, except the last block which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences (40 from the first four blocks and 9 from 480-488).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place.

From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only considering the hundreds digit here, so each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me double-check that. 400 is the first, then 401, ..., up to 488. So, yes, that's 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is included. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would be 48*10=480, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8,18,...,488: that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. That's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that looks correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, all these are valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, every 10 numbers adds another 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each and 1 block with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 484 / 10 = 48.4, but since we include 484, it's 49 times. Correct. Tens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: 488/10=48.8, so 49 times. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: none, so total eights=49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, that's 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many blocks: 1-100: 80-89 (10), 101-200: 180-189 (10), 201-300: 280-289 (10), 301-400: 380-389 (10), and 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so only 9 eights in the tens place here. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, but 40 + 9 is 49. But wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights:98. Now, to find how many more fours than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check again because sometimes when counting in the tens place for eights, I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the tens place eights. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. Units place: 49, tens:49, so 98. Fours:188.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers where 8 is in the units place. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Yes, so all those 10 numbers are included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same way. Let's go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we have 49 numbers where 8 is in the units place.

But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many blocks there are. Each block is 100 numbers, so from 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 100-199: 180-189 is 10, 200-299: 280-289 is 10, 300-399: 380-389 is 10, and 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Let's see how many such blocks exist within 488. 80-89: yes, that's 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. The next would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many blocks?

So, 4*10=40 and 9, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).

So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the tens place for 8. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 and 9, so 49. That's correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 =90. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, so 48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. The last one is 488. So, how many? Let's use the formula: floor((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480)/10=48, so 48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 and 9, total 49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188 fours and 98 eights.

How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. Let's set 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: (n-1)*10 = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49.

But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, let's see: each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

    "text": " But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers? Let me see: the first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would give 49 numbers, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is 488, so units digit is 8. So, yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the units place for fours, I considered 484 as the last occurrence, which is 484. Let me recount the units place for fours. From 4 to 484, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 484 /10 = 48.4, but since we include 484, it's 49 numbers. That seems correct. For the tens place, I considered 5 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 fours, which is 50. And hundreds place is 89. So, 188 fours. For eights, units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for eights. Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** \n   - The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - There are 49 occurrences (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, and we include both 4 and 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - '4' appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of '8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - There are 49 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and we include 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers.

The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. For units place in fours: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? Let's see, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So 5 blocks, 10 each: 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

    "text": " That's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-499, but since our book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 48*10 +8. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 8, so from 0-99:80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) have 10 each, and the last set has 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Correct. And hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. Correct. For eights, in the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Units place for eights: 8,18,...,488. Since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place. Let me count each block. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting, we find that there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's indeed 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Now, let me check if I missed any numbers. For example, does 444 count as having two 4's? Yes, but I'm counting each digit separately, so each occurrence is counted. So, in the hundreds place, it's 89 fours. Now, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of 8's is 49, same as the 4's in the units place. So, 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have a tens digit of 8? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. Same as fours, so 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90.

So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89.

I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would suggest 49 numbers, but let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Each step is 10, so starting at 8, the nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. The last term is 488, so 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Subtract 8: (n-1)*10 = 480. Divide by 10: n-1 = 48. So, n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, let me think again. Each full block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences.

So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. To find the count, subtract 399 from 488, which gives 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes, that's correct. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: the first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 48*10 + 8. So, 488 is the 49th term because 8 is the 1st, 18 is the 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489: but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 9 numbers in 480-488. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights)=90.

Wait, 488-480=8, but inclusive, so 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, all 5 blocks are fully included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is included, so how many numbers? It's similar to the 4's in units place. Let's see: from 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full block (like 80-89) has 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the last block is 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) each giving 10 eights, and the last partial block 480-488 giving 9 eights. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Units place: same as fours, 49. So, total eights:98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct.

Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400 to 488 inclusive is indeed 89 numbers because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89.

So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 0 to 484, every 10 numbers).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 eights each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's 5 sets of 10, so 5\u00d710=50. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, is that correct? Let me think: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers. So total eights in the tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, 49. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm wondering if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That seems correct. And in the tens place for fours, 5 sets of 10, so 50. Units place for fours, 49. So, 188 fours. For eights, units and tens each have 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. To find how many such numbers there are, let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me count: from 0 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8? The first is 8, then 18, ..., up to 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's calculate how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. And units place for 8's: from 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. So, yes, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90.
