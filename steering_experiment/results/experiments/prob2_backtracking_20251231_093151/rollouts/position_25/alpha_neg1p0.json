    "text": " That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check the upper limit. 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count: Each block from 0-100, 100-200, etc., has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 489 is beyond 488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) +0=98 eights. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49 numbers.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last block is 440-449, which is fully included because 449 < 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's the same as the number of numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? That seems high. Wait, let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place. How many hundred blocks? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only part of the fifth hundred block. Wait, no, 400-488 is within the 400-499 range, but the book stops at 488. So, how many full hundred blocks are there? Let me see: 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149 is 10. 200-299: 240-249 is 10. 300-399: 340-349 is 10. 400-488: 440-449 is 10, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond that. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 10 (from 40-49) +10+10+10+10=50. So, 50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488. How many numbers? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. So total fours: 49 +50 +89=188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that's 49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high, but let me check my calculations again. Let me recount the fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. Eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place, 50 fours. Units place:49. So, 188 fours. For eights, units:49, tens:49. So, 98 eights. Therefore, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would also be included if the book had 489 pages, but since it stops at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. So, let's count. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, so 4 x 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. But wait, in the last block, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 9 eights instead of 10. So, total tens place eights would be 40 (from the first four sets) plus 9, which is 49. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4 x 10 = 40. Now, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Let me check again. For the tens place, the eights are in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, so 4 x 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 +9=49. That's correct. So, the total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Fours are 188. So, 188-98=90.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, I'm only interested in the hundreds digit being 4, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me list them: 8,18,28,...,488. Each step is 10, so the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the last set is 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 more eights. So, total in tens place: 40 +9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th term).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 is the 49th term).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Additionally, in the range 480-488, there are 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1 four, so 48 fours, and then in the last partial set, 480-488, the units digit 4 is at 484, so that's one more, making it 49 fours. Okay, that's correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 fours in the tens place, and there are 4 full hundred blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 400-488. Wait, but from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500 but only up to 488). Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400-499 block, so yes, 440-449 is within that. So, 5 blocks each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50 fours. That's correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is the 49th. So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights except the last one, which contributes 9 eights (from 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, so 8+1=9). So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) has 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check the counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This occurs 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. This occurs 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-489 would be up to 488. Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is included, but 489 is beyond 488). So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers.  \n   - Total occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Number of complete blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 numbers.  \n   - Partial block (480-488): 9 numbers.  \n   - Total occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   - Occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\[\n188 \\, (\\text{fours}) - 98 \\, (\\text{eights}) = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last block for the tens place is 440-449, which is entirely within 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 count? Let me check: 488 is the last page, so yes. So, starting from 8, 18, ..., up to 488. How many numbers is that? The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place for 8. This would be numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many blocks? Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each and one block with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of eights from fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, yes, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers.

So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights from each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But since 8 is the first, and 488 is the 49th number. So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. Each step is +10, so the count is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n  \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 8,18,...,488. How many? Let's see: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then the 488 adds another. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for eights. In the tens place, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. And in the tens place for fours, it's 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.) each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see: 484 is the 49th number because 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. That seems right. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, so the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many numbers in each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).

    "text": " That's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but I'm only considering the hundreds place here, so yes, each number contributes one 4. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is the last page, the units place 8's go up to 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many? It's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 would have the tens digit as 8, but only up to 488. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, for the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, how many numbers are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Each has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 more eights. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9.

Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, every number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The formula is (Last - First)/Step + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so the last block is 380-389, and then 480-489, but since 488 is the last page, it's 480-488. Let's check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 = 9). So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488 as well, but only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, that seems off. Let me recount: Each hundred block (except the last one) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 0-488, the hundreds blocks are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. In each of the first four blocks, the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). The last block, 400-488, has 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks \u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but including 488, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 contributes 10 numbers, so that's 4 blocks, each with 10 numbers, contributing 40 eights. Now, the last block is 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in the page numbers. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in units place? The formula is floor(488/10) + 1 if the remainder is >=4. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, which is more than 4, so it's 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40, but wait, in reality, it's 400-499, but since our book ends at 488, the last set is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so actually, how many hundreds? From 0-400, the 4 in the tens place occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which is 48*10 +8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 48 +1=49? Wait, let's see: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. The count is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that can't be right because when I subtract 98 from 188, I get 90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Alternatively, maybe I should use a formula or a different approach to verify. Alternatively, for each digit position, count the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Let me try that.\n\nFor units place:\nNumber of 4s: floor(488/10) + (if 488 mod 10 >=4 then 1 else 0). 488/10=48.8, floor is 48, and 488 mod 10=8>=4, so 48+1=49. Similarly for 8s: floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10=8>=8, so 48+1=49. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\nNumber of 4s: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 10 per hundred. How many complete hundreds are there? 488 is 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, from 0-488, that's 5 hundreds? Wait, no, 0-99 is first hundred, 100-199 second, 200-299 third, 300-399 fourth, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred but not complete. So, in each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, in 4 complete hundreds (0-399), that's 4*10=40. Now, in the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit can be 0-8. So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 488 is the end, so 440-449 is fully included, so 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4s: 40 +10=50. Similarly, for 8s in tens place: Each complete hundred has 10 eights in the tens place (80-89). So, 4 complete hundreds: 4*10=40. In the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place 8s:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\nNumber of 4s: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\nNumber of 8s: From 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so 0 eights.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\nTotal eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that the hundreds place for 4s was 89, which is correct because 488-400+1=89. So, yes, 89 fours in hundreds place.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers (since 488-8=480, which is 48 steps of 10, plus 1 for the starting point). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last block. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each, and one block with 9.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book ends at 488, it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((488-8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many sets of 10 numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., contributes 10 eights. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Wait, no, wait: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. When I did 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one block of 9, so 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights 98. So, the difference is 90. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484. This is every 10 numbers, starting from 4 up to 484. There are 49 such numbers (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). So, 5\u00d710=50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n   \n   Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. This is every 10 numbers, starting from 8 up to 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89,180-189, etc. Each range contributes 10 numbers, except the last one (480-488), which contributes 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   \n   Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's actually 49 numbers because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

So, each block contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page). Let me count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place had 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I overcounted in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So that's correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

So, total in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 numbers.\n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's 5 sets of 10, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, the last set is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Wait, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake here because when I consider the hundreds place, the numbers from 400-488 include 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours are 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). Let me count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, but wait, in a 488-page book, 80-89 is within 1-488, so that's 10. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets we have. Each set from 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-489. However, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that set has 9 numbers (480-488). So, first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, contributing 4\u00d710=40 eights. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers, contributing 9 eights. So, total in tens place is 40+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems like a big difference, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the fours and eights. Starting with fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total: 188. Eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check that again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For eights, in the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That adds up to 49, which is correct. Units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 eight. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 eights each and 1 block with 9 eights. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. Units: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 in tens place. So total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because the hundreds place for fours is 89, which seems high. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. Similarly, for eights, in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since we include 488, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 would be at 488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is at 8, then every 10 numbers. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms are there? Let's see: The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Subtract 8: 10(n-1) = 480. Divide by 10: n-1 = 48. So, n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4x10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also count? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's see: each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with inclusive ranges. Let me verify the units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1=48 +1=49. That's correct. For the tens place, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For the eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.
