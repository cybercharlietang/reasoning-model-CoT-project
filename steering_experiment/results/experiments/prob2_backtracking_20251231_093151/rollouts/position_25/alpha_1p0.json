    "text": " Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and also 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets there are. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, the last set is 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in all these 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This gives 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is included, right? So, 488 is the last page, so 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is 488, so 8 in units place occurs 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is valid. So, each block contributes 10 numbers. Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each and 1 block with 9. So, 4x10 =40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many hundreds do we have? From 1-400, that's four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, let's see: 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours. 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10. 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10. 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10. 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see: The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many numbers is that? If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10. 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10. 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10. 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 eights because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, is that right? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (4, 14, 24, ..., 484) \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (8, 18, 28, ..., 488) \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. There are 5 hundreds in 488 (since 488 is less than 500). Wait, actually, let me think again. The hundreds go from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred except the last one, the tens place 4 occurs 10 times. But in the last hundred, 400-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, actually, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. There are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), so 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 x 10 = 50. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but the hundreds place is only the first digit, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, the last occurrence is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, but wait, 480-489 would be 10, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers). Wait, let me check: 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, each hundred except the last contributes 10 eights, and the last hundred contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 hundreds (0-399) contribute 10 each, so 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 from 400-488, totaling 49. Wait, but let me think again: 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, that's 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 count as 10 numbers? Yes, because 440 is included, and 449 is the last one before 450. So, yes, 10 numbers. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but I need to check if 400 to 488 is correct. Yes, because 400 is the first number with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last page. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one 8 in the units place. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is 488, so units digit is 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's check each block. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9 numbers in 480-488. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 4,14,...,484: 484 is the 49th number (since (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49).\n- Tens: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours.\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 +89= 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 8,18,...,488: 488 is the 49th number (since (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49).\n- Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9).

In the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, so numbers 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. That's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's correct, 9 eights in the tens place for that block.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely included because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last set. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think that's correct because from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.

Then, from 400-488, we have 440-449, which is another block. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds place is only the first digit, so in 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.

Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does it count as the 49th? Let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last block. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488. So, 488-480+1=9 numbers. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits that are 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98.

For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 440 is 440, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me check if I did that correctly. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Seems correct. Now, moving on to count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Each block of 100 contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, for the tens place, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) has 9 eights. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, did I count correctly? Let me double-check. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488. Occurrences = 0.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 488. So that's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 488 affect this? No, because 488 is beyond 449, so 440-449 is complete. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 page numbers. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: from 4,14,...,484: that's 484/10=48.4, so 49 times. Tens place: each hundred block contributes 10, and there are 4 full hundreds (1-400), but wait, 400-488 is part of the hundreds place. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think differently. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. The tens digit is 4 in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100: 40-49 (10), 101-200:140-149 (10), 201-300:240-249 (10), 301-400:340-349 (10), and 401-488:440-449 (10). Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, tens place:50. Units place: every 10 numbers, so from 1-488, how many 4's in units? Let's calculate 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing a 4, and then an extra 4 in the 49th group (484). So, 49 fours in units place. So, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)= 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, and then 488 itself is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens place. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-400: 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each with 10 eights in the tens place: 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. Wait, but in each 100 block, it's 10 numbers, so from 1-400, it's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights:0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly for the tens place in 4's. Let me check the tens place for 4's again. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 10 each, total 50. That seems correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place:49. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, so 98. Difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 1-400, each 100 block has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 blocks:4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, but each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. But wait, the hundreds place is only 4 in 400-499, but our book stops at 488, so it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is included, so how many numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's from 8 to 488 with a step of 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights except the last one, which only goes up to 488. Let's count them: - 80-89: 10 eights - 180-189: 10 eights - 280-289: 10 eights - 380-389: 10 eights - 480-488: 9 eights (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488: 9 numbers) So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place. How many hundreds do we have? From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). But wait, 400-488 is the next set, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is within 488. So, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, and there are 4 hundreds up to 400, but the last hundred (401-500) is only partially included up to 488. But since 440-449 is within 488, that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours would be 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus the 10 from 440-449, making it 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in the next partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but including the last one, it's 49 numbers. Wait, let's check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the last set. Each complete hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, so 9 numbers. So, the tens place eights: 40 (from complete hundreds) +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of 4's: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks (including the partial block 440-449).  \n   - Number of 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   - Number of 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of 8's: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - Each complete block contributes 10 eights, and the partial block 480-488 contributes 9 eights.  \n   - Number of 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So that's 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. So that's 5 x 10 = 50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last block. Let me count how many full blocks there are. Each block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, the first four blocks each contribute 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems like a big difference, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the fours again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, units place:49 fours. Tens place:40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349), each contributing 10, so 4 x10=40. Then 440-449 is another 10, so total 50. So, tens place:50 fours. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, for eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? Using the same formula: (488-8)/10=48, floor is 48, plus 1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4x10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 eights in tens place. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, 90 more fours than eights. But let me think again: is there a possibility that in the hundreds place, 480-488 has 9 numbers, but in the tens place, 480-488 is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in those. So, that's correct. So, I think the answer is 90. But wait, another way to check: total digits printed. But that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me see: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in hundreds place. That's correct. So, 89+50+49=188 fours. Eights: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. Wait, but I think I might have overcounted somewhere. Let me check the fours in the tens place again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Now, in the hundreds place, 400-488: that's 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, 89 fours. Units place:49. So, 49+50+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 eights each, totaling 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - 480-488 contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.

But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is included in the 400s, right? So, yes, 5 blocks. So, 5*10=50.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the 8 appears 10 in each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.), and 9 in the last block (480-488). So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488.

That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the last block would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the difference between the number of fours and eights is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I counted the units place for fours, I got 49, and for eights, I also got 49. That seems correct because both 4 and 8 appear once every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades and one partial decade (481-488 for 4, and 481-488 for 8 as well). Wait, no, actually, for 4's in units place, the last occurrence is 484, which is within 481-488. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Similarly, for 8's, the last occurrence in units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place for fours, I had 50 fours because there are 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50.\n\nFor eights in the tens place, I had 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4*10=40, plus the partial block 480-488, which has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 eights. So, 40+9=49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, fours appear from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nEights in the hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me recount that. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, then 140-149, another 10, 240-249, 10, 340-349, 10, and 440-449, which is another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4 full blocks and a partial one, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of fours is 188, eights is 98, so 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, I might have miscounted. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, more accurately, it's the number of complete decades plus any extra in the last partial decade.\n\nWait, the formula is: for digit d in position p (units, tens, hundreds), the count is:\n\nhigher = number formed by digits higher than p\n\ncurrent = digit at p\n\nlower = number formed by digits lower than p\n\nif d < current: count += (higher + 1) * 10^p\n\nif d == current: count += higher * 10^p + lower + 1\n\nif d > current: count += higher * 10^p\n\nWait, maybe that's too complicated, but perhaps I can use this formula to check.\n\nLet me try for 4's in units place.\n\nPosition p=0 (units).\n\nNumber is 488.\n\nhigher = 48 (digits above units place: 4 and 8)\n\ncurrent = 8 (units digit is 8)\n\nlower = 0 (no digits below units)\n\nSince d=4 < current=8:\n\ncount = (higher + 1) * 10^0 = (48 + 1) * 1 = 49. So, 49 fours in units place. That matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\nd=8, current=8.\n\ncount = higher * 10^0 + lower + 1 = 48 * 1 + 0 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in units place. Correct.\n\nNow, for tens place:\n\nFor fours in tens place:\n\np=1.\n\nnumber is 488.\n\nhigher = 4 (digit above tens place: 4)\n\ncurrent = 8 (tens digit is 8)\n\nlower = 8 (units digit is 8)\n\nd=4 < current=8:\n\ncount = (higher + 1) * 10^1 = (4 + 1) * 10 = 50. So, 50 fours in tens place. Correct.\n\nFor eights in tens place:\n\nd=8, current=8.\n\ncount = higher * 10^1 + lower + 1 = 4 * 10 + 8 + 1 = 40 + 8 +1=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nfours in hundreds place:\n\np=2.\n\nnumber is 488.\n\nhigher = 0 (no digits above hundreds place)\n\ncurrent =4\n\nlower =88\n\nd=4 == current=4:\n\ncount = higher * 10^2 + lower +1 = 0 * 100 + 88 +1=89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nEights in hundreds place:\n\nd=8, current=4.\n\nSince d=8 > current=4, count = higher * 10^2 = 0 * 100=0. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n\nEights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 '4's, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 488 include all of 440-449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units digit. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be next, but 488 is the last page. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89 is the first block, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. So, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. But wait, does 480-489 exist? Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but the units digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have an extra 9 eights? Wait, no, because in the tens place, each block of 100 has 10 eights in the tens place. But in the last block (400-488), the tens digit is 8 only from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, actually, in the hundreds place, when we look at the tens digit, the first three hundreds (1-399) have 4 blocks of 10 eights each, so 40 eights, and then in the 400-488 range, we have 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place would be 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 blocks, each with 10, giving 40, but now I'm considering that in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times. So, total eights in tens place: 40 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought units place had 49 eights, tens place had 49, so total eights: 98. Now, the fours were 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Let me recount the tens place for eights. From 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. From 180-189: another 10. From 280-289: another 10. From 380-389: another 10. So, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 480-488: the tens digit is 8, but the numbers are 480, 481, ..., 488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. So, units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. Total eights: 98. Fours: 188. So, difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 40, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. But wait, 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. So, that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the last one is 484. To find how many, it's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units: 49. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 10 each, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place as 8 in the tens digit. So, each block contributes 10 eights, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 eights and 1 block with 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4x10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so numbers are 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, yes, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, so 49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Units place: 49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in each position up to 488. Let me try that approach for both 4's and 8's to confirm.\n\nFirst, for the number of 4's:\n\n- **Units place:** As before, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, the last group is 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so the last group is incomplete. But in the units place, 488 is included, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within 480-489. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 49, as calculated before.\n\n- **Tens place:** For the tens digit, each 100 numbers have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers), 101-200:140-149 (10), 201-300:240-249 (10), 301-400:340-349 (10), 401-488:440-449 (10). So, that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- **Units place:** Similarly, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1-488, that's 48 full groups of 10 (480 numbers), contributing 48 eights, plus the last 8 at 488, so 49.\n\n- **Tens place:** Each 100 numbers have 10 eights in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). So, from 1-400: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 sets, each with 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** As before, no numbers in 1-488 have 8 in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10 (480 numbers) plus 8 more numbers (481-488). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 groups give 48 fours. Additionally, 484 is within the range, adding one more, totaling 49 fours.\n   - **Tens place:** The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges contribute 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89), contributing 89 fours.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10 plus 8 more numbers, contributing 48 eights. The number 488 adds one more, totaling 49 eights.\n   - **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 eights, totaling 40. The range 480-488 contributes 9 eights, so total tens place eights = 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me make sure. 400 is included, so starting at 400, each number up to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*49=482, but wait, 8*49=482? Wait, no, 8 in units place occurs at 8,18,28,...,488. So, 488 is 8 in units place, so how many terms? Let's see, the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 -480 +1=9). Wait, but 480-488 is actually 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total eights from total fours: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right.\n\nI think I've considered all the cases correctly. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last block, which has 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 488. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's included. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets there are. Each full set (like 80-89) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book ends at 488, which is less than 800. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. That's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484: that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let's see: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 9 instead of 10 because 489 is beyond 488. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 49, correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49, tens place 49, so total 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's.\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: how many numbers? 488 - 400 +1=89. So, 89. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers, as calculated.\n\nTens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nWait, but wait a second: when counting the units place for 8's, I included 488, which is correct because it's the last page. So, units place: 8,18,...,488:49 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 90, but let me think again.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the number of 4's and 8's is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in that position.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- For 4's: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, total number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10)=48 full groups, but since 488 is the last number, which is 48*10 +8, so the 49th occurrence is at 484. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic, 49 times.\n\nFor tens place:\n\n- For 4's: each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 4 complete blocks (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 40-49 would be the tens digit 4, but 401-488 doesn't include 40-49. Wait, no, 401-488: the tens digit is 0-8, but the tens digit being 4 would be from 400-409, but 400-409 is within 401-488? Wait, 400 is included in 401-488? Wait, no, 400 is the starting point. Wait, 400 is page 400, which is included in 400-488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 0-8, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4 blocks (1-400) each with 10, and then 440-449 in the 401-488 range, which is another 10. So, total 5*10=50.\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: similar logic. Each block of 100 has 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 blocks (1-400) contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nSo, that's consistent with earlier counts.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\n- 8's: none, as the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnother way to calculate the total number of 4's: For each digit position, calculate how many times 4 appears.\n\nUnits place: floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing 1 four, and then check if the remaining numbers after 48*10=480 include a 4 in the units place. 481-488 includes 484, which is a 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: floor(488/100)=4 full cycles, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. Then, the remaining 88 numbers (400-488) have 10 fours in the tens place (440-449). So, total tens place 4's:4*10 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place: floor(488/1000)=0 full cycles, but the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing 1 eight, and then check if the remaining numbers (481-488) include an 8 in the units place. 488 is included, so that's 1 more. So, total units place 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: floor(488/100)=4 full cycles, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. Then, the remaining 88 numbers (400-488) have 9 eights in the tens place (480-488). So, total tens place 8's:4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's is 89, but that seems correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers.\n\nWait, another way: total number of 4's in hundreds place is 89, which is more than any other digit's hundreds place count. So, that's a significant contribution.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. The number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188.

The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is only part of the 400s. Wait, actually, the 400s go up to 488, so the tens place in the 400s would be 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these has 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480s, so how many numbers there? 480-488 is 9 numbers (including both ends). But wait, in the tens place, each block is 10 numbers, but in the 480s, the tens digit is 8, but the units digit goes up to 8. So, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let me check: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, except possibly the last hundred. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but let me think again. From 0-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The first set is 80-89:10, then 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just double-check my counts. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with inclusive ranges. Let me verify the units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full decades, which gives 48 fours, but since 484 is included, that's 49 fours. That seems correct. For the tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets of 10, so 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 eights. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90.

Wait, but let me check the upper limit. 440-449 is within 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 in all of them, so 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so 48+1=49. Wait, no: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets of 10 are there where the tens digit is 8? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 400 to 488 inclusive is indeed 89 numbers. So, hundreds place gives 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so the units digit is 8. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count: Each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 4 blocks with 10 eights each, and 1 block with 9 eights. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block of 9. So, 4x10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 4*10=40 fours. But wait, 440-449 is the fifth block, right? Because 400-499 would have 440-449, but since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is still within 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188 fours. Now, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.

The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49.

So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 full blocks (each contributing 10) and one partial block contributing 9.

So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4x10=40, plus 9 in 480-488. So, total 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4x10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I should count manually for smaller numbers to verify. For example, from 1-100: How many 4's and 8's? Units place: 4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: 10 fours. Tens place: 40-49: 10 fours. So, total 20 fours in 1-100. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98: 10 eights. Tens place: 80-89: 10 eights. So, 20 eights in 1-100. So, in 1-100, 4's and 8's are equal. But in the problem, the book goes up to 488, which is beyond 100. So, in 1-100, 4's and 8's are equal. Now, from 101-200: Units place: 104,114,...,194: 10 fours. Tens place: 140-149:10 fours. So, 20 fours. Similarly, 8's: Units place:108,118,...,198:10 eights. Tens place: 180-189:10 eights. So, 20 eights. So, again, equal. From 201-300: Similarly, units place: 204,214,...,294:10 fours. Tens place:240-249:10 fours. So, 20 fours. 8's: 208,218,...,298:10 eights. Tens place:280-289:10 eights. So, 20 eights. Equal again. From 301-400: Units place:304,314,...,394:10 fours. Tens place:340-349:10 fours. So, 20 fours. 8's:308,318,...,398:10 eights. Tens place:380-389:10 eights. So, 20 eights. Equal. Now, from 401-488: Units place:404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 fours. Wait, 404 is the first, then every 10 up to 484. So, 484-404=80, 80/10=8, plus 1=9. So, units place:9 fours. Tens place:440-449:10 fours. So, tens place:10 fours. Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, so hundreds digit is 4 for all, so 89 fours. So, total in 401-488: units (9) + tens (10) + hundreds (89) = 108 fours. Now, for 8's in 401-488: Units place:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 eights. Tens place:480-488:9 eights (as earlier). So, units place:9, tens place:9, so total 18 eights. So, in 401-488, 108 fours and 18 eights. So, overall, in the entire book: 4's: from 1-400: 20 (1-100) +20 (101-200)+20 (201-300)+20 (301-400)=80 fours. Plus 108 fours in 401-488, total 188 fours. 8's: from 1-400:20 each hundred, so 20x4=80 eights. Plus 18 eights in 401-488, total 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is correct because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers where the hundreds place is 4, which is from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188 fours. Now, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's indeed 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence in units place is 488. Let me calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is at 8, then every 10 numbers after that. So, how many such numbers? The last one is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. From 8 to 488 with step 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, not 10 because 489 is beyond 488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. So, 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait a second, the first block is 40-49, which is in the first 100 pages. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 488 include 440-449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one. So, 8,18,...,488: that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488.

So, the first four blocks have 10 each, and the last block has 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the ranges. For the fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Let me recount the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct. For the eights: units place:49, tens place:49. So, total eights:98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, how many blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d710 =50. But wait, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449.

Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let me find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. Let's see how many blocks: 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488. Now, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480+1=9. So, for the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9 in the last block. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me recount the fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, 5 blocks, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. How many? (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, and the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Hundreds place:0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours was 89, which is correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers. But let me check the tens place for fours again. 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50. Correct. So, 188 fours, 98 eights. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. But wait, does 488 include all of 440-449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, 8,18,...,488. To find how many, we can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 is also included, but 488 is the last page. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the fifth block contributes 9. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th term because (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four is 10, fifth is 9, so 4*10+9=49. So total eights: 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but actually, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Hmm, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is included). So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights:49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units + tens + hundreds=49+49+0=98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. But wait, does 488 include 440-449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The step is 10. So, number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place as 8. So, how many sets? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many eights in the tens place? 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed. Wait, but let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds place only goes up to 4. Let me check: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in each of these blocks. Let me see how many full blocks there are. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so that's 4 hundreds (1-400), but wait, 400 is included in the 400-488 range. So, the number of tens places with 4 is 10 per hundred, and there are 4 hundreds (1-400), but wait, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so does that affect the count? Wait, no, because 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-488 as well. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let's calculate:\n\n- 1-99: 40-49: 10 times\n- 100-199: 140-149: 10 times\n- 200-299: 240-249: 10 times\n- 300-399: 340-349: 10 times\n- 400-488: 440-449: 10 times\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, 400-488 is from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 440-449 is 10 numbers, which is fine. So, total tens digit 4's: 50.\n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 400-488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, ..., up to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 fours.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nWait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see: the first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488.\n\nHow many terms? Let's see: 8,18,28,...,488. The difference between each term is 10, so it's an arithmetic sequence starting at 8, ending at 488, with common difference 10.\n\nThe formula for the number of terms is ((last term - first term)/common difference) +1.\n\nSo, ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nWait, let's check each block:\n\n- 1-99: 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 -480 +1=9.\n\nSo, the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times in each of the first four blocks (1-399) and 9 times in the last block (400-488).\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each hundred block from 1-400 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block which only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks with 10 each and 1 block with 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 4,14,...,484: 49 numbers\n- Tens: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: 5 sets of 10, so 50\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers\nTotal: 49+50+89=188\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units:8,18,...,488:49\n- Tens:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: 4 sets of 10 (10 each) and 1 set of 9, so 4*10 +9=49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nSo, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for fours. I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Let me see: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). Yes, that's 5 sets, so 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any edge cases. For example, in the hundreds place for fours, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is correct because 488-400+1=89.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has a common difference of 10.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers.\n   - Total: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me check: 400 is included, so yes, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms? (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that correct? From 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers because 488-480=8, so 8+1=9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) has 9 eights. So total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check: from 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 include numbers up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the last page is 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're counting whole numbers, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: starting at 8, every 10 numbers, so 8,18,...,488. So, how many? The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Units place: 4,14,...,484, which is 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488, which is 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189, etc., up to 480-488, which is 49 numbers. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 5 sets of 10 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 4 sets of 10 and 9 numbers \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
