    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see, the first occurrence is at 4, and the last is at 484. The total number can be calculated by dividing 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, and then checking if there's a partial group. Wait, but actually, since 488 is the last page, the units digit 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there? The last term is 484, which is 48*10 + 4, so the number of terms is 48 + 1? Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th term. Let me think again. From 0 to 488, how many times does the units digit cycle through 0-9? It's 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, with 8 remaining numbers (480-488). In each full cycle, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (480-488), the units digits are 0-8, so 484 is included, which adds one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 480 is 480, which is 480, so units digit 0, then 481, units 1, up to 488, units 8. So, in 480-488, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, so that's one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 (from 0-480) + 1 (from 484) = 49. Wait, but actually, when considering 1-488, the first page is 1, so the first occurrence is 4, which is the 4th page, so perhaps the count is correct as 49. Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit is 4. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), 4 (400-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in the blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 numbers, except perhaps the last one if it's cut off. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, how many blocks? That's 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 times. So, tens place 4's: 50. Now, hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place.\n\nUnits place: 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many times.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many full cycles? 488 /10=48 full cycles, with 8 remaining numbers (480-488). In each full cycle, 8 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (480-488), the units digits are 0-8, so 488 is included, which adds one more. So, units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nNow, tens place: 8 appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many such blocks? From 0-488, the hundreds digits can be 0 (for 1-99),1,2,3,4. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, check if there's a partial block beyond 400. The next would be 480-489, but since we go up to 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 would be in 480-488, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488? Wait, no. Wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488? Wait, no, 480 is 480, tens digit is 8, yes, because 480 is 4 8 0. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? Because 480, 481,...488 all have 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, I think I missed that earlier. So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that adds 9 more to the tens place count. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks *10=40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again for 4's. Units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me verify the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 4,14,24,...,484. So, the number of terms is floor(488/10)=48, but since 484 is included, which is 48*10 +4=484, so the number of terms is 48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: from 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so 488/10=48 full cycles, plus 488 is the 49th term. So, 49.\n\nNow, tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:90.\n\nWait, but let me check again for 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89. So, 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nSo, yes, 89.\n\nSo, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nUnits for 8's:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, in each set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Let's see how many such sets there are in 488. From 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 full sets with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 full sets where the units digit cycles through 0-9, and in each, 4 appears once. That's 48 times. But wait, the last set goes up to 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so the 48th set ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. In the 481-488 range, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that. Actually, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (sets of 10) times 1, plus any additional in the incomplete set. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 sets, each contributing 1, so 48, and in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once in 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8 in the last partial set. So yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place. In each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in the range 40-49 in each hundred. For example, in 1-100, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of these hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times. But wait, the last hundred is 301-400, so the next hundred would be 401-500, but we only go up to 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So total tens place 4's: 4 * 10 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-499. But our book only goes up to 488, so in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1-488, there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial set 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 401-488. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would occur in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I calculated 4's, I had 188, and 8's would be 98, so the difference would be 90. But let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but when I counted 4's in the hundreds place, I had 89, which seems correct because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. But for 8's, in the hundreds place, there are none because 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188 - 98 = 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the 4's in the tens place. I said 401-488 contributes 10 4's in the tens place because 440-449. That's correct because 440-449 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the 4's in the units place, I had 48 full sets (1-480) contributing 48, and then 484 in the last 8 numbers (481-488), so that's 1 more, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the units place, 488 is included, so that's correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's: 98. Difference: 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. That's correct.\n\nYes, I think that's right. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and a partial block from 481 to 488. Each full block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial block (481-488), the units digit is 4 in 484, so that's one more. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how about the tens place? The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have blocks at 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4's, each block of 10 numbers contributes one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and then the partial block from 481-488. In the partial block, the units digit is 8 in 488, so that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each of these blocks (except maybe the last one) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. The first four are complete, each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has numbers from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, in the tens place, each of these 9 numbers has an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 more. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place was 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89, totaling 188. For 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0, totaling 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, maybe that's correct, but let me check each part again. Units place for 4's: 48 full blocks (1-480) each contributing one 4, and then 484, so 49. That seems right. Tens place for 4's: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units place, same as 4's, 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9), so 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, yes, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 full decades (1-480) contributing 48 4's, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 4's, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Similar to 4's, there are 48 full decades contributing 48 8's, plus one more in 488, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 40 8's, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is the number of such blocks. Let me calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. But wait, I should check if the last partial block (481-488) includes another 4 in the units place. The last number with 4 in the units place before 488 would be 484, which is within the 480-489 block. So, yes, that's included in the 48 blocks. So, 48 times 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where 4 is in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? Let's see. The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, for the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 times 4 in the tens place. So, for hundreds digit 0: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Similarly, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each contributes another 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, for hundreds digit 4, which is 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? That would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (from 140-149) + 10 (from 240-249) + 10 (from 340-349) + 10 (from 440-449). That's 5 times 10, which is 50. Wait, but hold on. The last block is 400-488. So, 440-449 is within that, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the page numbers 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Each number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Wait, but that's the total count for the hundreds digit being 4, which is 89 times. So, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's printed: 187. Now, let's do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8. Now, the last partial block is 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit is 8 in 488. So, that's included in the 48 blocks. So, 48 times 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks are there up to 488. For hundreds digits 0,1,2,3,4. So, for each hundreds digit except 4, we have a full block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 0: 80-89 (10 numbers), 1: 180-189 (10), 2: 280-289 (10), 3: 380-389 (10). For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 would be from 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the hundreds digit 4 block, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 0 to 3) plus 9 from the 4 block. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's printed: 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   \nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., but only 9 times in the 400-488 range. Total = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, it's 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4. That gives 48 times. But wait, in the last partial block from 481-488, does 484 fall here? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. Let's see how many full hundreds are there in 488. Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 times 4 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, which is 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. The hundreds place is 4 for 400-499, but since our book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yeah, that's correct. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Wait, units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. So, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial block 481-488, 488 is included, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Similar to 4's, the tens digit is 8 for 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's calculate: Each full hundred contributes 10 times 8 in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 800 is beyond 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check if I did the counting correctly. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 90. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, 4's: in each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, etc., so 10 per hundred. 4 hundreds, so 40, plus in the last hundred, 440-449, which is 10. So, 50 total. Units place: 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. So, 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (480 numbers) and one partial decade (481-488). Each full decade contributes one 4, totaling 48. The partial decade adds one more (484), making it 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, totaling 40. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10, making it 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. Similar to 4's, there are 48 full decades and one partial decade, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, totaling 40. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 480-488, adding 9, making it 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find the count, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, it's 48 times. Wait, but does 488 include 484? Let me check: 484 is within 488, so yes, 48 times. But wait, when I think about it, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only counting complete sets of 10, it's 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, for example, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 (200-299), 340-349 (300-399), and 440-449 (400-488). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, how many ranges? From 0-99: 1 range, 100-199: 1, 200-299:1, 300-399:1, and 400-488:1. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. That would be from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, the count for 4's in the hundreds place is 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? From 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is the same as the number of times 4 does, right? Because it's every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 10n - 2. Wait, 8 is the first term when n=1: 10*1 -2=8. The last term is 488, which is 10n -2=488 \u2192 10n=490 \u2192 n=49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. Hmm, that's different from 4's. So, units place for 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's see how many ranges: 0-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299:280-289, 10. 300-399:380-389, 10. 400-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, same for 180-189, etc., but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. The hundreds digits go up to 4 (400-488). So, the hundreds place never has an 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Wait, that's 98. But wait, let me double-check: units place 49, tens place 49, so total 98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. For 4's: units place: 48 (since 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, but wait, 488 is included, so maybe it's 49? Wait no, because in units place, the 4's are at 4,14,...,484. 484 is the last one because 484 +10=494, which is beyond 488. So, how many terms? Let's see: starting at 4, each step +10. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. We want the last term \u2264488. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488 \u2192 (n-1)*10 \u2264484 \u2192 n-1 \u226448.4 \u2192 n=49. Wait, so that would be 49 terms. But earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, I think I made a mistake there. Let me correct that. So, units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place:49. Similarly, for tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and how many such ranges? From 0-99:40-49, 10 numbers. 100-199:140-149, 10. 200-299:240-249,10. 300-399:340-349,10. 400-488:440-449,10. So, that's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. So, tens place:50. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so hundreds place:89. So total 4's:49+50+89=188. Wait, earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188. Hmm, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate. Units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's:188. Now, for 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. Hmm, let me check again. Let me recount the units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, step 10. Number of terms: (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units:49. Tens place:5 ranges, each 10, so 50. Hundreds:89. So, 49+50=99, +89=188. 8's: units:49, tens:49, so 98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188. I think I made a mistake in the initial count of units place for 4's. So, the correct count is 49 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds, totaling 188. 8's:49+49=98. So, difference is 90. Let me just make sure I didn't make any other mistakes. For 8's in units place: from 8,18,...,488. How many terms? (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last has 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: no 8's, correct. So, 8's total 98. 4's:188.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 4,14,24,...) has one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of such sets. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 480-488 range, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so the 48th set would end at 480, and then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 to 8, so no additional 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times. Wait, but 488 is 48*10 + 8, so yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place as part of numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, let me add that again: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, just like 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. Wait, but let me check: 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 to 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units place: 48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: Units:48, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** \\( 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's minus number of 8's: \\( 187 - 97 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 blocks of 10. Each block contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, which adds one more 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, actually, 480 divided by 10 is 48, so 48 times, and then from 481-488, 484 is the only one, so 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that seems right. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see, the first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, and so on up to 440-449. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last block would be 440-449. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-400, there are 10 blocks of 100, so 4 in the tens place occurs 10 times in each block. So, 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Wait, actually, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is the fifth block, and 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for page numbers from 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and it goes up to 488, which is correct. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many such 8's? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the last block (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, but we take the integer part, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. But wait, 48 \u00d7 10 = 480, so from 1-480, there are 48 8's in the units place. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds one more 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many 8's? Each block of 100 contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, from 0-400, there are 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's. That's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, which would be the fifth block, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - Additionally, 484 adds one more 4.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149).\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) within 488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - This is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - Additionally, 488 adds one more 8.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189).\n   - There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - Additionally, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's: 188\n- Number of 8's: 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, in each set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. How many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, I should check if the 48th set ends at 480, and then there's 481-488, which is 8 more numbers. In that last partial set, the units digit is 1-8, so no additional 4 in the units place. So, 48 times from the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, in blocks of 10. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, from 40-49, that's one block, and then from 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, but when it's 4, that's another block from 440-449. So, in the first 100 numbers (1-100), there's one block (40-49). Then, from 101-200, another block (140-149), and so on up to 400-488. Let me count how many hundreds there are. From 1-400, there are four blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another block. So that's five blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but wait a second. Let me check. From 40-49: 10 numbers, 4 in tens place. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 340-349: that's four blocks. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is another 10 numbers, so that's five blocks. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Okay, so 50 times from the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 up to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but wait. Actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, similar to the 4's. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set from 481-488, the units digit is 1-8, so 8 appears once more in 488. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: from 1-100: 80-89 is one block. Then, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's another block. So, how many blocks? 80-89: 1 block, then 180-189: 2, 280-289:3, 380-389:4, and 480-488:5. So, five blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers. Wait, no. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? So, 480 has 8 in tens, 481 has 8, etc., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) has 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (every 10 numbers up to 480).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (every 10 numbers up to 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = **89**.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 full blocks. But wait, each block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. However, I should check if the last partial block (if any) has a 4 in the units place. The last page is 488, so the units digit is 8, not 4. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for a span of 10 numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Let me see how many such blocks exist up to 488. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10. Then, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 instances of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, that's 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 ends with an 8, so the last block is complete. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many full blocks? Let's see: 80-89 is one, 180-189 is two, 280-289 is three, 380-389 is four, and 480-488 is five, but only 9 numbers here. Each full block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) give 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 9 more. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, there are 97 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems right. For the 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, in the 480th group, which is 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488. So, in that group, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total number of 4's in units place is 48 times. Wait, no, that's not right. Because each group of 10 numbers contributes exactly one 4 in the units place. So, for 488 pages, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times. Because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check with an example. From 1-10: 4 appears once. 11-20: once. So, yes, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. Now, 48 times 1 is 48. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, let's count how many full groups of 100 have 4 in the tens place. Each group of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 4's each. So, how many such groups are there? From 1-100: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. From 101-200: 140-149: another 10. From 201-300: 240-249: another 10. From 301-400: 340-349: another 10. Now, 401-488: the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total number of 4's in the tens place is 5 groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488) each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 401-488. Yes, because 440 is greater than 401 and 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's printed: 187.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many times that happens. From 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, let me check the last group: 480-488. The units digit 8 appears at 488, so that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so in the 480-488 group, the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So, total number of 8's in the units place is 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (at 488), totaling 49. Alternatively, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then the last partial group (480-488) contributes one more 8 at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so in the 480-489 range, it's only up to 488. So, how many full groups of 100 have 8 in the tens place? Each group contributes 10 8's in the tens place. From 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. From 101-200: 180-189: another 10. From 201-300: 280-289: another 10. From 301-400: 380-389: another 10. From 401-488: 480-488: how many numbers? 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, in the tens place, the 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 groups of 10 (1-400) plus 9 in 401-488. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 8's in the tens place in that range. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place count because I might have made a mistake. From 1-400, each 100 group has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 groups * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I counted the 4's in the tens place, I considered 5 groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488), each contributing 10 4's, except the last group which might have been cut off. But in reality, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 1-400, it's 4 groups of 10, and then 480-488 is 9, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small program or use another method to verify, but since I'm doing it manually, let me try to recount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the total number of digits and see if the counts make sense.\n\nBut I think my initial approach is correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units place (1s place):** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one '4' in the units place. Additionally, in the last partial group (480-488), there's another '4' at 484. So, total '4's in units place = 48 + 1 = 49. However, upon correction, it's realized that each group of 10 contributes exactly one '4', so it's 48 groups, each contributing one '4', totaling 48.\n\n   - **Tens place (10s place):** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each 100-number block contributes 10 '4's in the tens place. There are 5 such blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). The first four blocks each contribute 10 '4's, and the last block (401-488) contributes 10 '4's in 440-449. So, total '4's in tens place = 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n   - **Hundreds place (100s place):** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. There are 89 numbers in this range (488 - 400 + 1), each contributing one '4'. So, total '4's in hundreds place = 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units place (1s place):** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one '8' in the units place. Additionally, in the last partial group (480-488), there's another '8' at 488. So, total '8's in units place = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens place (10s place):** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each 100-number block contributes 10 '8's in the tens place. There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 '8's. The last block (401-488) contributes 9 '8's in 480-488. So, total '8's in tens place = 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds place (100s place):** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. So, total '8's in hundreds place = 0.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   \n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit cycle through 0-9? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a cycle, it's 48 full cycles, which account for 48 times 4 in the units place. But wait, in each cycle of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, 48 times. However, the last partial cycle is from 481 to 488, which includes 488. The units digits here are 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, 48 times in total. Wait, but actually, 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times, because each full ten has one 4, and there are 48 full tens (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles). Wait, but 488 is 48*10 + 8, so yes, 48 full cycles. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds are there? From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, no, actually, 488 is 4*100 + 88, so 4 full hundreds and then 88 pages. But wait, 401-500 would be the next hundred, but we only go up to 488. So, in each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 full hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers, so the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 times total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's check. From 1 to 488, each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full cycles (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). So, 48 times. Now, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once in the units place (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many full hundreds do we have? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. In the tens place, for 8's: each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 4 full hundreds: 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. That's correct. So, 4's total 187, 8's total 98. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct. And for 8's, hundreds place is 0. So, yes, 187-98=89.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, I can calculate how many such numbers there are. The last number with 4 in the units place is 484, which is 484 divided by 10, which is 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full tens. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, that would be 48 times. Wait, but let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times. Hmm, but wait, does 484 count as the 48th? Let me see: 4,14,24,...,484. The count is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's 49 times. Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, it's 49 times in the units place. Let me confirm: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each block of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. The number of such blocks is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48*1=48. But wait, in the last partial block, from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears at 484, which is within this block. So, that's an additional 1, making it 48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many such blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers, and each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 40-49: that's one block, 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. That's 5 blocks. Each contributes 10 times, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, plus 89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 48th occurrence, right? Because 488 is 48*10 +8. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? That's in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many such blocks? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 times, and the last block contributes 9 times. So, total is 4*10 +9=40+9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 +49 +0=97 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -97=91. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=48, tens=49, hundreds=0. 48+49=97. 188-97=91. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (including 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, totaling 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, totaling 49 times (including 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n3. **Difference:** Subtract the number of 8's from 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 appears 91 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see, the first occurrence is at 4, then every 10 after that. To find how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, and then check if there's a partial group. 48 groups would give 48 times the digit 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within the 480-488 range. So yes, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but the last block is 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's fine. So 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). But how many times does the digit 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 times. Wait, let me check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. The last occurrence is at 488, which is included. So 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. Let's count the blocks: From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. Now, from 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 are included. So that's 9 numbers (480-488), each contributing an 8 in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 occurrences. So total for the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (each contributing 10) and 1 partial block of 9. So 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So 49 times in the tens place. Wait, but let me think again. From 0-399, we have 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each with 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, the digit 8 appears 97 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., and in 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see, how many such numbers are there. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with 8. So, actually, from 4 to 484, which is 484 - 4 = 480, so 480/10 = 48. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) times 1, plus any extra if the last number is beyond. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full decades, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. So, units place: 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay, but 480-488 is beyond 449. So, let's calculate how many full groups of 100 have 4 in the tens place. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149, another 10. From 201-300: 240-249, another 10. From 301-400: 340-349, another 10. From 401-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place: 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, that's 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the 48th group plus one more. Wait, let me think. The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place. These occur in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's calculate each hundred. From 1-100: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189, another 10. From 201-300: 280-289, another 10. From 301-400: 380-389, another 10. From 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit. The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. For the tens place, in each hundred, the 8's in the tens place are 10 numbers, except for the last hundred (401-488). In 401-488, the tens place is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50. That seems correct. So, the difference is 187-98=89. Wait, but I feel like the answer might be different. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should use a formula or a different approach. Another way is to consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each position. Let me try that. For units place: For any digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to n is floor(n/10)*1 + extra if the last digit is >= d. Similarly for tens and hundreds places. Let me formalize this. For units place: The number of times 4 appears is floor(488/10) = 48, plus 1 if the last digit is >=4. Since 488 ends with 8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, for 488 numbers, the number of times 4 appears in units place is floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10)=48.9, which is 48 full times, but since 488 is included, does that add another? Wait, perhaps I should use the formula: number of times digit d appears in units place up to n is (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10). So, for d=4, n=488. 488 // 10 = 48. 488 % 10 = 8. So, 8 -4 +1=5. So, 48*1 +5=48+5=53. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think differently. Let me list the numbers where 4 is in the units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. Similarly, for 8's in units place: numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? First term 8, last term 488. (488-8)/10=48, so 48+1=49 terms. So, units place for 4's is 49, units for 8's is 49. So, earlier, I thought units for 4's was 48, but it's actually 49. So, that changes things. Let me recalculate the total number of 4's and 8's. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count for 4's in the units place. Let me double-check. The units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's: 49+49=98. So, difference is 90. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier by counting units place for 4's as 48 instead of 49. So, the correct difference is 90. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should use a more systematic approach. Let me consider each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n1. Units place:\n   - The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 48, plus 1 if the units digit of 488 is >=4. Since 8 >=4, we add 1, so 48+1=49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is equal to the number of complete groups of 100 in 488, which is 4 (since 488/100=4.88), each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4*10=40.\n   - But wait, in the last partial group (401-488), how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total is 4*10 +10=50.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - The number of times 4 appears in the hundreds place is the number of numbers from 400-488, which is 488-400+1=89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n1. Units place:\n   - Similarly, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is 48 (from 488//10) plus 1 if the units digit is >=8. Since 8>=8, add 1, so 48+1=49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - Number of times 8 appears in the tens place: number of complete groups of 100 is 4, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4*10=40.\n   - In the last group (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total tens place 8's: 40+9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - As before, 8 cannot appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.  \nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " So, in 1-488, how many times does the 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there? Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each full block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place (second digit from the right):** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 40-49 is one block, 140-149 is another, 240-249 is another, and 340-349 is another. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, so 400-409 would have 4 in the tens place, but wait, 400-409 is part of the 400-488 range. Wait, actually, let me correct that. The tens digit is 4 in the block 400-409, but since the book goes up to 488, 400-409 is a complete block where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 more 4's. So, how many blocks do we have? Let's list them: 40-49: 10 numbers, 4's in tens place. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 400-409: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Wait, but does 400-409 fall within 488? Yes, because 409 is less than 488. So, total 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit from the right):** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because the hundreds digit is 4 only when the number is 400 or above, so from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems high. Wait, let me check again. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, but each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. But wait, in the tens and units places, when we're in the 400-488 range, we might have already counted some 4's in the tens and units places. But in this problem, we're counting each occurrence of the digit 4, regardless of where it is. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, each contributing one 4, so that's correct. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Now, the last partial block is 481-488, which has 8 in the units place at 488, so that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place (second digit from the right):** Now, 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, let's count how many full blocks we have: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit from the right):** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. Total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 48 full blocks (1-480) plus 484, so 49. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 400-409, which is 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units place: 48 full blocks (1-480) plus 488, so 49. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (which is 9 numbers). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: 48 full groups of 10 (1-480) + 1 in 484 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (second digit):**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 400-409.\n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 400-409).\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (third digit):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Each contributes one 4: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 48 full groups of 10 (1-480) + 1 in 488 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (second digit):**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Number of full blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Each contributes 10 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Partial block (480-488): 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (third digit):**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 4, and the last is at 484. To find the number of terms, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d. Here, a_1 = 4, d = 10, and a_n = 484. Plugging in: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, let me check: 484 is the last one, so from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yep, that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 440-449. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 140-149 (10). From 201-300: 240-249 (10). From 301-400: 340-349 (10). From 401-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences. So 5*10=50. But wait, let me confirm: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So yes, 5 times 10 is 50. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, it's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, the last occurrence is at 488. Let me calculate how many terms. Using the same approach: a_1 = 8, d = 10, a_n = 488. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Similar to 4's, it's in blocks of 100. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, the first four blocks have 10 each, and the last has 9. So, total occurrences: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 occurrences. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. Correct. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the total number of such blocks. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full blocks and then 8 more numbers (481-488). Each block contributes one 4, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, which is another 4. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. In the tens place, 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 instances where 4 is in the tens place. Let's see how many full blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book has 488 pages, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers in 440-449 are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's printed. Now, let's do the same for 8's. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? As before, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks and 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each block contributes one 8, so 48 times. In the last partial block, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's another 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count how many full blocks we have. From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The last block, 480-488, is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's printed. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see, the last page is 488, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. To find how many such numbers there are, I can calculate how many groups of 10 there are in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups. But wait, each group contributes exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th group would end at 480, right? So from 481 to 488, the units digit is 1 to 8, so 484 is indeed within this group. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, we have the 40-49 range (10 numbers), 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place is a bit trickier. The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, let me check that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, and adding 1 gives 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, 488 is included. The number of such numbers is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, which is the 48th group. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place for 8. It appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences except the last one, which might be shorter. Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last one contributes 9. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place for 8. Now, in the hundreds place, 8 would appear from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, meaning 48 full groups of 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, meaning 48 full groups of 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - The last range (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, in each set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. How many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full sets, we have one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 will have a 4 in the units place, which is one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Well, 440-449 is within 488, but 450-459 would be beyond 488, so only up to 440-449. So, let's count: 40-49: that's one set, 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another set, so two. Then 240-249: three sets. Then 340-349: four sets. Then 440-449: five sets. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check: 40-49: yes, 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, is 440-449 fully included? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers in the units place. So, up to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. That's 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers each time: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many full sets of 10 do we have? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: only 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that's a big number. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 48 full sets (48) + 1 in the last partial set (484) = 49. Tens place: 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) each with 10 4's: 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units place: 48 full sets +1 in 488: 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me recount. 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389:10. 480-488: from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 8's in the tens place. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: 98 total 8's. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 4's. Additionally, in the last partial set (481-488), 484 adds one more 4. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in each set (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such sets up to 440-449, each contributing 10 4's. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 8's. Additionally, 488 adds one more 8. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in each set (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full sets contributing 10 each and a partial set from 480-488 contributing 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place up to 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, I can divide 488 by 10 to find the number of such blocks, which is 48 full blocks (since 48*10=480) and then there are 8 numbers left (481-488). Each block contributes one 4, so 48 blocks give 48 fours. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so only 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. Let me figure out how many hundreds are there in 488. That's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? Yes, so that's 10 more. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting 8's in the tens place. Similar to 4's, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds (1-400), that's 4*10=40 eights. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488. That's 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 (from 1-400) +9=49, which is correct. So, yes, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " So, in 1-99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 10 times. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so I need to check if 400-488 affects this. From 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, from 1-480, that's 48 sets, each contributing a 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total 4's in the tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll check each place separately: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets. Each contributes one 8, so 48 times. From 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's an extra 1, making it 49. Wait, let me check: 1-480 has 48 sets of 10, so 48 eights in units place. Then 481-488: the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 8 appears once here. So total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks? Each 100 numbers has one block where the tens digit is 8. From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 187-98=89. Hmm, seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (every 10 numbers up to 480).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (10 each in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 sets of 10 up to 480, plus one in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (10 each in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " So, in every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Let me see how many such blocks there are up to 488. From 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 full blocks (since 48*10=480) and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of these 48 blocks, the units place gets a 4 exactly once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so 484 will have a 4 in the units place. That's one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range x40 to x49, where x is the hundreds digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times this happens up to 488. Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.) contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each of these contributes 10, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, in the 400-488 block, does it go up to 488? The tens digit 4 in 440-449 is fine because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full blocks of 10 (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each block contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. In the last partial block, 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 will have an 8 in the units place. That's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like x80 to x89, where x is the hundreds digit. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 48 full blocks (1-480) \u2192 48, plus 484 in 481-488 \u2192 49. Tens place: 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) each contributing 10 \u2192 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers \u2192 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place: 48 full blocks + 488 \u2192 49. Tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) \u2192 4\u00d710=40, plus 480-488 \u2192 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Wait, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Let me count how many numbers that is. From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, total 8's in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each decade contributes 1, so 48 + 1 (for 484) = 49.\n2. **Tens Place:** 4 appears in ranges like x40-x49. There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, 48 full decades contribute 48, plus 488 contributing 1, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens Place:** 8 appears in ranges like x80-x89. There are 4 full decades (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10, and 480-488 contributing 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete sets of 10, which is 48 times, plus any extra if 488 is included. Since 488 ends with an 8, the last 4 in the units place would be at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see, the first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, another 10. Then 340-349, another 10. Then 440-449, another 10. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 times for the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, meaning 48 times. But wait, let me check the last number. 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, starting at 8, 18, 28,... up to 488. The number of terms in this sequence is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 80-89 is one block, 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but only up to 488. So, how many full blocks are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 8's in the tens place, but the last block, 480-488, only has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers. So, for the first four blocks, that's 4 * 10 = 40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the block 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** \n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last set might not be complete. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last complete set is 480-488. So, the 48th set ends at 480, and from 481 to 488, the units place goes from 1 to 8, so 480 is included, which is a 4 in the units place. So, 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Wait, but let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) times 1, plus any extra in the incomplete decade. Since 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the units digit cycles 48 full times, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long, so each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49: that's one, then 140-149, another, 240-249, another, 340-349, another, and 440-449, which is the fifth. Now, let's check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's valid. So, each of these five ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check the upper limit. The book has 488 pages, so 440-449 is okay, but 450-459 would be next, but that's beyond 449, which is within 488. So, yes, 440-449 is valid, so five ranges, each with 10 4's, so 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. This happens in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, let me add that again: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is indeed 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets. Each set contributes one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, the last set is 480-488, so the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, yes, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Let me check how many full ranges there are. 80-89: one range, 180-189: another, 280-289: another, 380-389: another, and 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the 480-488 is partial. So, each full range (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many full ranges are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four full ranges, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Now, the last range is 480-488. How many numbers are there from 480 to 488? That's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, each of these numbers has an 8, so 9 more 8's. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would occur in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89, total 187. For 8's: units place: 48, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0, total 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify each step again.\n\nWait, when counting the tens place for 4's, I considered five ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's correct because each hundred has a 40-49 range, and 440-449 is within 488. So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. That's correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place of 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I had four full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's, so 40, and then 480-488 contributing 9 more, so 49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for both 4 and 8: 48 each, which makes sense because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Wait, but wait a second, in the units place, does 488 have an 8? Yes, so the units digit cycles 48 times, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place, for 4's, it's 48, and for 8's, it's 48 as well. But in the tens place, 4's have 50, 8's have 49. So, 4's have one more in the tens place, making the total 4's higher by one in that digit, but overall, the hundreds place adds 89 more 4's, which is a significant number.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n8's: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nSo, 187 - 97 = 90. Therefore, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (every 10 numbers, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, each contributing 10).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400-488, inclusive).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (same as 4's).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, contributing 10, 10, 10, 10, and 9 respectively).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (no pages beyond 488).\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 48 full blocks and then a partial block from 481 to 488. But in the units place, the 48th block ends at 480, and then 481-488 doesn't add another 4 in the units place because 484 is in that range. Wait, no, 484 is 480 + 4, so that's another 4 in the units place. So, actually, it's 48 full blocks (each contributing one 4) plus one more 4 at 484, making it 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, and then checking if the remaining numbers after 480 include another 4 in the units place. Since 484 is within 481-488, that's an extra 4, so total 49. So, units place: 49 times 4 appears. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 5 blocks x 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, and since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 1-488, so yes, that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times 4 appears. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, hundreds place: 89 times 4 appears. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's calculate: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. Then, in the partial block from 481-488, 488 is the last number, which is an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last block. Each of these blocks contributes 10 times the digit 8 in the tens place. So, how many blocks? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, except the last one, which has 9 numbers (from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 is 4-8-0, 481 is 4-8-1, etc., up to 488. So, in the tens place, each of these blocks contributes 10 times, but the last block only has 9 numbers. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers. So, does that mean in the tens place, the last block contributes 9 times instead of 10? Let me think. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers, so that's 9 times. So, total tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4 x 10 = 40, plus the last block 480-488 contributes 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but wait, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4 blocks x 10 = 40, plus 9, total 49. So, tens place: 49 times 8 appears. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full blocks of 10 numbers (480 instances) plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Five blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 instances, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488, contributing 89 instances.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full blocks of 10 numbers plus one in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Five blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488), contributing 49 instances.\n- **Hundreds place:** No instances since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480/10 = 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4. So, that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles up to 8. So, 488 is included, but the units digit for 488 is 8, not 4. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how about the tens place? The 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers, since 440-449 is within 400-488). Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400 is included, so 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 ends with an 8, so that's the 48th 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many ranges: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, we have 4 full ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, that's 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place (48) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, there are 97 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 97 from 187: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each step again. For 4's: Units: 48 times, correct because 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing a 4 in units place. Tens: 5 ranges (40-49, etc.) each 10, so 5 x10=50. Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. Total 4's: 48+50+89=187. For 8's: Units: 48 times, same logic. Tens: 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) each 10, so 4x10=40, plus the last range 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. Hundreds: 0. Total 8's: 48+49=97. Difference: 187-97=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I said from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? 440,441,...,449. So, that's correct, 10 times. And the hundreds place for 4's is 89, which is correct because 488-400+1=89. For 8's, in the tens place, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 4 x10 +9=49. That's correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (1-480).\n2. **Tens Place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (1-480).\n2. **Tens Place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit.\n**Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. So, from 1-10, it's 4; 11-20, it's 14; and so on. The total number of such blocks is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, from 1 to 480, that's 48 blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so there's another 4 in 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 488 is the last page, so from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 is included, which adds one more 4 in the units place. So, total 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (from 481-488) = 49. Okay, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49 have 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, so 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, from 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, how many blocks? Let's count: 1-99: 1 block, 100-199: 1, 200-299:1, 300-399:1, 400-488:1. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10 = 50. But wait, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So, total 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This is from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. So, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, from 1-480, that's 48 blocks, so 48 8's. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's another 1. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the number of blocks with 8 in the tens place: From 1-399, there are 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the number of 4's in the units place. From 1-488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, the number of such numbers is floor(488/10)=48, but since 484 is included, which is the 48th multiple plus 4, so actually, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 4's in the units place. Correct. Tens place: For each hundred, the 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. From 1-488, how many hundreds? 1-99:1 block, 100-199:1, 200-299:1, 300-399:1, 400-488:1. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now for 8's: Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. So, from 1-488, how many? It's floor(488/10)=48, but 488 is included, so 48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: None, as before. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete sets of 10 in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. However, wait, from 1 to 488, the last set is 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times, because 488 divided by 10 is 48 full sets (1-10, 11-20,...481-490, but since we stop at 488, the 49th set isn't complete, but the 48th set includes 484). So, 48 times. Wait, but let me check: from 1-488, the number of 4's in the units place is indeed 48 because each 10 numbers contribute one 4, and 488 is 48 sets of 10 plus 8 more. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how about the tens place? The 4 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: the first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the second is 140-149, the third is 240-249, the fourth is 340-349, and the fifth would be 440-449. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's, so 5 blocks would contribute 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many 8's in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full blocks and one partial block. Each full block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. The partial block (480-488) has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 more 8's. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's: 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Number of 4's = \u230a488 / 10\u230b = 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   Number of such blocks = 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   Each block contributes 10 4's, so total = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   Number of such numbers = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.  \n   Each contributes one 4, so total = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Number of 8's = \u230a488 / 10\u230b = 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   - Full blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 (4 blocks).  \n     Each contributes 10 8's, so total = 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - Partial block: 480-488 contributes 9 8's.  \n   Total = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Number of 8's = 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **97**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 97 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, it's 48 full cycles of 10. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place? Let me see: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th cycle. So, that's 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, so 480/10 = 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no extra 4. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). In each of these, the tens place is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (400-409), 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 400-488 includes the 400s, so the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 only once, from 400-409. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The tens digit is 4 in each hundred block. So, in 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). In 101-200: 140-149 (10 numbers). In 201-300: 240-249 (10 numbers). In 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers). Now, in 401-488: the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's another 10. So total tens place 4's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus the 440-449 which is another 10, making it 50? Wait, no, because 400-488 includes the 400s, so in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409 (10 numbers) and 440-449 (another 10). So that's 20 in the 400s. But wait, I already counted 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349 as 40 numbers. Then in 400-488, we have 400-409 (10) and 440-449 (10), so that's another 20. So total tens place 4's would be 40 + 20 = 60? Wait, that can't be right because 488 is less than 500, so maybe I'm overcounting. Let me think differently. The number of times the tens digit is 4 is determined by how many complete sets of 100 there are, plus any partial sets. Each complete set of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many times does the tens digit equal 4? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, that makes more sense. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but let's check the last number. The last number with 8 in the units place before 488 is 488 itself, which is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10 each time. So, how many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u21d2 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u21d2 n-1 \u2264 48 \u21d2 n \u2264 49. So, 49 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so let's see: 488 is 488, which is 8 in the units place, so yes, it's included. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), does the tens digit equal 8? Let's see: 480-489 would have the tens digit as 8, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure about the tens place for 4's. I had 50, but let me recount. Each hundred block contributes 10 in the tens place. So, 1-100: 40-49 (10). 101-200: 140-149 (10). 201-300: 240-249 (10). 301-400: 340-349 (10). Then, 401-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Yes, that's correct. And for 8's, in the tens place, we have 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each, and then 480-488 contributing 9, so 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49. That seems right. Units place for 4's: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but since 488 is included, does that add one more? Wait, no, because 488 is 488, which is 8 in the units place, not 4. So, 48 times for 4's in units place. For 8's, units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but since 488 is included, that's 49 times. So, 49 is correct. So, the calculations seem correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 187, and 8's is 98, so 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences per 100 numbers.\n   - Total blocks: 4 (from 1-400) + 1 (440-449 in 401-488) = 5 blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 times (includes 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences per 100 numbers.\n   - Total blocks: 4 (from 1-400) + 1 (480-488) = 5 blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{89}."

    "text": " So, in every set of ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), there's exactly one 4 in the units place. To find out how many such sets there are up to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full sets (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so we take the integer part). Each set contributes one 4, so that's 48 fours. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), there's a 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the ranges are 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the 484, so 49. Tens place: 40-49 is 10 fours, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. That's 5 sets, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many full tens are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights. But wait, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, in 488, the units digit is 8, so that's another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers each time, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the ranges are 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) = 89 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 89 is 99, but let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. 49 + 40 = 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the units place for 4's. Let me check again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488 / 10) + (if the last digit is >=4, then 1 else 0). Wait, no, actually, for each full group of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, for 488 pages, the number of full groups is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). So, 48 fours. Then, in the last partial group, which is 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is in this group, so that's one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the units place: same logic. 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the last partial group, 488 has an 8, so 48 + 1 = 49. So, that's correct. Tens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Correct. Tens place for 8's: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. Hundreds place for 8's: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0 eights. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Total eights: 49 + 40 + 0 = 89. Difference: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, but I'm getting 99, but I thought maybe it's 99, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, the total fours are indeed 188. Eights are 89. So, the difference is 99. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different, but maybe it's correct. Let me think of another way to calculate. Alternatively, I can consider each digit position separately for both 4's and 8's, and sum them up. So, for 4's: units, tens, hundreds. Units: 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in 481-488, 484 is another 4, so 49. Tens: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 50. Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units: 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48, plus 488, so 49. Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 sets, so 40. Hundreds: none. Total eights: 49 + 40 = 89. So, difference: 188 - 89 = 99. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check if I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the tens place for 4's, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Similarly, in the units place, 484 is counted once. I think the counts are accurate. So, I think the answer is 99.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 '4's. Additionally, in the range 481-488, there's another '4' in 484. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in each set (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 '4's. Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets, contributing 48 '8's. Additionally, 488 adds another '8'. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in each set (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 such sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 '8's. Total: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 89\n   - Difference: 188 - 89 = 99\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 99 more times than the digit '8' in the page numbers of the book.\n\n$\\boxed{99}$"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4,14,24,... up to 484. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The last such number is 484, which is 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484 = 4 + 10(n-1). Subtract 4: 480 = 10(n-1). Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n=49. So, 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 484 is the last one, which is 484/10 = 48.4, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus the 4 in 484. Hmm, maybe it's better to calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488, which is 48 full groups (since 48*10=480), and then the remaining 8 numbers (481-488). In each full group of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 groups give 48 4's. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in 484. So total units place 4's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? Let's see: the first block is 1-100, the second 101-200, the third 201-300, the fourth 301-400, and the fifth 401-488. Wait, but 401-488 is only 88 numbers, not a full 100. So, in each full block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. How many full blocks are there? Up to 400, there are four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks *10=40. Now, in the last partial block, 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 401-410, the tens digit is 0, then 411-420 is 1, 421-430 is 2, 431-440 is 3, 441-450 is 4, 451-460 is 5, 461-470 is 6, 471-480 is 7, 481-490 is 8, but our book stops at 488. Wait, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers: 440,441,...,449. But wait, our book goes up to 488, so 449 is included. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place. So total tens place 4's: 40 (from full blocks) +10=50. Wait, but let me check: 401-488 is 88 numbers. The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times the tens digit is 4 is once every 100 numbers. Since 488 is less than 500, in the 401-500 range, the tens digit is 4 exactly once, from 440-449. So yes, 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 +10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, ..., up to 488. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +50 +89= 188. Hmm, wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, but let's go through it again to be sure. From 1 to 488, the 8 in the units place occurs every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., up to 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488. Let's solve for n: 10(n-1)=488-8=480. So, n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many full blocks of 100 are there in 488? Up to 400, there are four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial block, 401-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But our book stops at 488, so 480-488 includes 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from full blocks) +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens: 49 +49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's and 8's separately. For 4's: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. Let me think again: From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. And for the tens place, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. Similarly, for 8's, in the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, I think the calculation is right. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (1s place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences (48 full decades and one in 484).\n   - **Tens place (10s place):** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences. There are 4 full blocks (1-400) contributing 40, and one partial block (401-488) contributing 10 more, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place (100s place):** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers where '4' is in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place (1s place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens place (10s place):** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences. There are 4 full blocks contributing 40, and in the partial block (401-488), 8 appears in 480-488, contributing 9 more, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place (100s place):** No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's = 188 (total '4's) - 98 (total '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of blocks is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, it's 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4. That gives 48 fours. However, wait, the last block is 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so the units digit 4 appears in 481, 491, etc., but since we only go up to 488, let's see: from 1-480, there are 480 numbers, so 480/10 = 48 fours in the units place. Then, from 481-488, the units digit 4 is in 484. So, that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but wait, 480/10 is 48, and then 481-488 is 8 numbers, so only one more 4 in the units place, so total 49. Hmm, but maybe a better way is to calculate it as (488 // 10) + (1 if 488 % 10 >=4 else 0). Let me check: 488 //10 is 48, and 488 %10 is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1, making it 49. So, 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. Each time, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10, and so on. So, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, for each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. So, how many hundreds? From 0 to 4, that's 5 hundreds. But wait, when hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit 4 block is 440-449. But 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 hundreds x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 fours, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. This happens from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, actually, in the hundreds place, it's just the digit 4, so each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, but for 8's. So, every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. So, 48. But wait, the last block is 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so in the units place, 8 appears in 488, which is the 488th page. So, 488 is included, so units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (488), so 49. Alternatively, using the same method as before: 488 //10 =48, and 488 %10 =8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1, making it 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the block. So, how many such blocks? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488-480+1=9). Wait, no, actually, from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, each block contributes 10 eights except the last one, which contributes 9. Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, each block contributes 10 eights, but the last block may be cut short. Let me think again. From 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-489: but we only go up to 488, so 480-488: that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This occurs from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total units place 4's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - Number of such blocks: 5 (from 40-49 up to 440-449).\n   - Total tens place 4's: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all page numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total units place 8's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total tens place 8's: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers contributes one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In those extra numbers, the units place goes from 1 to 8, so the 4 in the units place appears once more (484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, actually, when I divide 488 by 10, I get 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, and then in the remaining 8 numbers, 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times, plus if the last partial block has a 4 in the units place. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4, so no extra 4's. Wait, no, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the units digit 4 appears 48 times in the first 480 numbers, and in 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 484 has a 4, so that's one more. So total 49. Okay, so 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Then, this pattern repeats every 100 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's calculate. From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each 100 numbers, there's a block where the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, how many full hundreds are there? 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Wait, no, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88. So, the tens digit 4 appears in each hundred block. Let me think again. The tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, since 488 is beyond 449, but the next block would be 540-549, which is beyond 488, so we don't count that. So, how many such blocks are there? From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4's, but let's check. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is the range. So, how many full blocks? Let's see. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, up to 488, which is 4 8 8. So yes, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. Earlier, I thought there are 5 blocks of 10 where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 numbers. Wait, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. For 8's in the tens place, we have 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and then 480-488 contributing 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. Units place for both 4 and 8: 49 each. So, 4's total 188, 8's total 98. Difference is 90. Wait, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 times. That's correct. So, yes, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (480 numbers) contributing 48 fours, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 fours. There are 5 such blocks (including 440-449), totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with 4 full blocks and an additional 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit within 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. In each group, there's exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, 4 can appear in the tens digit. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but the last block is only up to 488, so the tens digit 4 in 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 4's appear 187 times. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The last partial group is 481-488, so 488 is included, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count the blocks: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40 +9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

    "text": " So, in each block of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such blocks are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, in the last block, which is 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 489-490 aren't included. So, does that mean there are 48 instances where 4 is in the units place? Let me check: From 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units place doesn't have a 4 because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, 484 is included because 484 is less than 488. So, actually, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the floor, which is 48. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is within 1-488. So, that's 48 times. Alternatively, maybe it's better to calculate it as the number of complete tens. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The 4 in the tens place occurs in blocks where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nBut wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely included because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. From 40-49: 10 numbers, correct. Then 140-149: another 10, that's 20. 240-249: 30, 340-349: 40, and 440-449: 50. So, yes, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 instances.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to count the number of 4's, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but actually, when considering the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, that's 89 times.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place again.\n\nUnits place: 8 appears every 10 numbers, so similar to 4, but let's check.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as 4, right? Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, let me check if 488 is included. The units digit 8 occurs at 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, 488 is included, so that's 49 times? Wait, because from 1 to 488, the first 8 is at 8, and the last is at 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated as follows: The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. We need to find n such that 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488.\n\nSo, (n-1)*10 \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, there are 49 instances where 8 is in the units place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48, but this calculation shows 49. Hmm, maybe I was wrong before. Let me think again. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (blocks of 10) plus one if the last number is included.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but since the book ends at 488, the last decade is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, in the units place, 8 appears once in each complete decade, so 48 times, plus once in the incomplete decade (488). So, total 49 times. So, that's 49.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the same for 4, I thought it was 48, but maybe I was wrong. Let me check for 4 in the units place again.\n\nFor 4 in the units place: 4,14,24,...,484. So, the last term is 484, which is less than 488, so the number of terms is 484 / 10 = 48.4, so 48 terms. So, 48 times.\n\nBut for 8, the last term is 488, which is included, so it's 49 times. So, the units place for 8 is 49.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought both 4 and 8 have 48 in the units place. Actually, 8 has 49, and 4 has 48.\n\nMoving on, the tens place for 8.\n\nThe tens digit is 8 in the blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nEach block where the tens digit is 8 contributes 10 instances, except possibly the last one if it's incomplete.\n\nSo:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488)\n\nSo, total times 8 appears in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, correct. 180-189: another 10, so 20. 280-289: 30. 380-389: 40. Then 480-488: that's 9 numbers, so 49 total.\n\nSo, 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8.\n\nThe hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\nWait, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, 9 times 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nUnits place: 49, as we determined earlier.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place for 8 is zero, so total 98.\n\nNow, let me check the 4's again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n4's:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187.\n\nSo, 187 4's and 98 8's.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 187 - 98 = 89 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the units place for 4: 4,14,...,484. So, 484 is the last one, which is 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, so 48 times.\n\nUnits place for 8: 8,18,...,488, which is 49 times.\n\nTens place for 4: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 50 times.\n\nTens place for 8: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 5 blocks, but the last one is incomplete, so 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the 8's in the units place were 49, but let me check that again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nThe first occurrence is at 8, then every 10 numbers: 18,28,...,488. So, how many terms are there? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488.\n\nSo, 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, 49 terms. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the units place, the last term is 484, which is 4 + 48*10 = 484. So, n=49 would be 4 + 48*10=484, but 484 is less than 488, so n=49 would be 484, which is included. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48 times. Wait, no, 484 is the 49th term because starting at 4, each 10 numbers adds one more 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, let me list some terms:\n\nTerm 1: 4 (4 + 0*10)\nTerm 2:14 (4 +1*10)\n...\nTerm 49:4 +48*10=484.\n\nSo, 49 terms. But wait, 484 is less than 488, so it's included. So, why did I think it was 48 earlier? Maybe I was mistaken. Let me recalculate.\n\nSo, if the units place for 4 has 49 terms, then the count would be 49, not 48. Wait, but 488 is the last page, and 484 is within that. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence of 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm seeing it's 49. Let me check:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of numbers where the units digit is 4. That is, 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms?\n\nThe formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1.\n\nLast term is 484, first term is 4, step is 10.\n\nSo, ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, 49 times. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 48. It's actually 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought for 8 in the units place it's 49, and for 4 it's 49 as well. So, both units places have 49. Hmm, that changes things.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If 4 appears 49 times in the units place, then:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought 4's units place was 48, but now I'm seeing it's 49. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, 484 is the last occurrence of 4 in the units place, which is page 484. Since 484 is less than 488, it's included. So, how many terms? From 4 to 484, step 10.\n\nNumber of terms: (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, yes, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place, the last term is 488, which is included, so 49 times.\n\nSo, 4's total:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's total:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the difference is 90.\n\nBut earlier I thought it was 89, but that was because I mistakenly counted 4's units place as 48. So, now I'm seeing it's 49, leading to a difference of 90.\n\nWait, let me make sure again.\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, +89=188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 4 and 8.\n\nFor 4 in the tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.\n\nEach of these blocks is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 50 times. Correct.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nSo, 5 blocks, but the last one is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nCorrect.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the hundreds place for 4 was 89. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 4's:188, 8's:98.\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the number of 4's is to consider each digit position separately.\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:50\nHundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:49\nHundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences (since 484 is the 49th term).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences (since 488 is included).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** 90 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, I can divide 488 by 10 to find the number of such blocks. 488 \u00f7 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll take the integer part, which is 48 blocks. Each block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last block ends at 480, and then we have 481 to 488. In these remaining 8 numbers, 484 will have a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, in 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: the first block is 40-49, the second is 140-149, third is 240-249, fourth is 340-349, and the fifth would be 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me check: from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, it's 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 is the only one with an 8 in the units place. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many such blocks? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's five blocks, but the last one has only 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the fifth contributes 9. So, total 8's in the tens place: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 8's in the hundreds place: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89) \u2192 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units (49), tens (49), hundreds (0) \u2192 49 + 49 = 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Yeah, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has one number ending with 4. So, the number of such sets is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. However, wait, the last set might not be complete. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the 48th set ends at 480, and the 49th set is 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have only 8 numbers in the 49th set. But since 488 is the last page, the units digit 4 appears in 488's units place as well. Wait, 488 is 4 in the hundreds place, 8 in the tens, and 8 in the units. So, 488's units digit is 8, not 4. Therefore, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times. Wait, but let me confirm: from 1 to 480, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, 400-488: does this include a full block of 440-449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included in 400-488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 in the hundreds place. This occurs in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, the last set is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (from 488) = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place. This happens in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the block. Let's count how many full blocks and partial blocks we have. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: each is a block of 10. Then, 480-488: this is a partial block, but the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers (480-489). Since we go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each full block contributes 10, and the partial block contributes 9. So, number of full blocks: 4 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). Each gives 10, so 4 x 10 = 40. Plus the partial block: 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 8 in tens place. 180-189: another 10, same for 280-289 and 380-389. So, that's 4 blocks, 40 times. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 8 in the hundreds place. This would occur in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed in the page numbers is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 187 - 98 = 89. \n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, that's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 8 pages. So, the 48th group ends at 480, and from 481 to 488, the units place doesn't have a 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, the 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 440-449 is within 488, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we only have the blocks up to 440-449. Let's count: 40-49: 10 numbers, 4 in tens place. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is up to 449, and 488 is beyond that, so that's fine. So, total 4's in tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 in the hundreds place occurs in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, that's 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, from 481 to 488, the units digit is 8 in 488. So, that's one more 8. So, total 48 +1=49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** For the tens place, 8 appears in blocks of 100. So, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that block. So, how many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 8 in tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: this is the last block. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 -98=89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89, total=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total=98. 187-98=89. Yeah, that seems correct.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4,14,24,...,484. To find out how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, the last group might not complete. Let me check: the last number with 4 in the units place before 488 is 484, which is 48*10 + 4 = 484. So, from 1 to 484, there are 48 numbers where 4 is in the units place. But 488 is beyond that, so I think it's correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, so that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's five ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included, so how many terms are there? Let me compute: The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Let's count how many full ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full ranges (each 10 numbers) and one partial range with 9 numbers. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where 8 is in the hundreds place. So, 0 times here. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 48 occurrences (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences as page numbers don't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference = 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"
