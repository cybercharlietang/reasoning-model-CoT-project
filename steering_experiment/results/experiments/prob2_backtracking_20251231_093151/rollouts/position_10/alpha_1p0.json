    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. Let me calculate that: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th group would end at 480, and then we have 481-488. So, from 1-480, there are 48 groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds another 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, actually, when I divide 488 by 10, it's 48.8, but the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of times 4 is in 1-488. So, it's the integer division: 488 // 10 = 48, but since 488 itself ends with 8, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is 48*10 + 4 = 484. So, from 1 to 484, there are 48 times 4 in the units place. Then, from 485 to 488, the units digits are 5,6,7,8, so no additional 4's. So, total 4's in units place: 48. Wait, but earlier I thought 488 //10 is 48, so 48 times. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these decades has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such decades are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 decades, each contributing 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, each decade has 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 decades * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, tens digit 4. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So, yes, 5 decades, 10 each, total 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. So, numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's go through it. How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Every 10 numbers, so 488 //10 = 48, but let's check if 488 is included. The last number ending with 8 before 488 is 488 itself. So, 488 is included, so 488 //10 = 48, but since 488 is the 49th group (1-10, 11-20,...481-490), but since we're only going up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, how many 8's in the units place? Each group of 10 has one 8, so 48 full groups (1-480) contribute 48 8's, and then in 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. So, how many such decades? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 full decades (80-89, etc.) contributing 10 each, and the last partial decade (480-488) contributing 9. So, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. That seems correct. I think I did it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n1. **Units place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this occurs 48 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, but we only consider complete groups of 10).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place for entire decades (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such decades up to 440-449, contributing 10 occurrences each, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal '4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n1. **Units place:** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this occurs 49 times (including 488).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place for decades (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), with the last being 480-488 (9 numbers). This gives 4 full decades (40 occurrences) and 9 from the partial decade, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal '8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Since the book has 488 pages, the last page with a 4 in the units place is 484. So, how many such numbers are there? From 4 to 484, each 10 pages contribute one 4 in the units place. The number of 4's in the units place would be (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, let me check that. Alternatively, since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 4 in 484, making it 49. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, yes, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how about the tens digit? The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 isn't fully included because the book ends at 488. So, let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each hundred has a set of ten numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many such numbers are there? The last one is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, the number of 8's in the units place is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, same as 4's in the units place. Hmm, but wait, 488 is included, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, let's calculate. Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, how many sets? From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89, total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Yes, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), except the last set which ends at 488, giving 9 occurrences. Total: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see how many such numbers there are. Since the book has 488 pages, the last page is 488. So, the last 4 in the units place would be 484. How many 4's are there in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete groups of 10, plus any extra if the last page isn't a multiple of 10. Let me calculate: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 4's in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the next 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within this range. So, that's one more 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you divide 488 by 10, the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, we need to check if 488 has a 4 in the units place. 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th group (480) plus one more at 484. So, yes, 48 + 1 = 49 4's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, pages where the tens digit is 4. These would be from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, 240 to 249, 340 to 349, and 440 to 449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with the tens digit as 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are.\n\nFrom 40-49: 10 pages\n140-149: 10 pages\n240-249: 10 pages\n340-349: 10 pages\n440-449: 10 pages\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 1-488, right? 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. So, pages from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So, how many pages are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's printed is 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, but for 8's. So, pages ending with 8: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.\n\nHow many such pages are there? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. But let's check the last page: 488 ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Pages where the tens digit is 8. These would be from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count these.\n\n- 80-89: 10 pages\n- 180-189: 10 pages\n- 280-289: 10 pages\n- 380-389: 10 pages\n- 480-488: 9 pages (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, for the first four ranges, each has 10 pages, and the last range has 9 pages because 489 is beyond the book's pages. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Pages where the hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8 because 800 would be beyond 488. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because when I calculated 4's, I had 188, and 8's as 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go through the 8's tens place again. The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 80-89: 10 pages, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 pages. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, 8,18,...,488: since 488 is included, that's 49 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the 4's in the tens place. I had 5 ranges: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 400-488: 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nUnits place: 4,14,...,484. So, from 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, and then 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nThus, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the 4's units place. Let me check again. The units place 4's go up to 484, which is 48*10 +4, so that's 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then one more at 484, making it 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's units place, 488 is included, so 49.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 8's in the tens place. The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Each of these has 8 in the tens place, right? Because the tens digit is 8. So, 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 has 8, and so on up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place. So, 9 8's in the tens place for that range.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\n4's:188.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a big difference. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit place, but perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 mod 10 >=4, we add 1, so 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod10=8>=8, we add 1, so 49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: Let's see. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400). Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8 (80-89). So, 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 488-400+1=89 pages.\n\nNumber of 8's: There are no pages with hundreds digit 8, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99 +89=188.\n\n8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, so that's consistent. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Maybe I can try a smaller example to see if my method works.\n\nSuppose we have a 20-page book. Let's count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nPage numbers:1-20.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits place:4,14 => 2 times.\n\nTens place:40-49, but since we only go up to 20, none. So, tens place:0.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 4's:2.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18 =>2 times.\n\nTens place:80-89, but only up to 20, so none.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 8's:2.\n\nDifference:2-2=0.\n\nWait, but according to my method, let's see:\n\nUnits place 4's: floor(20/10)=2, and since 20 mod10=0, which is less than 4, so 2.\n\nTens place 4's: floor(20/100)=0 complete hundreds, but in 1-20, the tens digit is 4 only in 40-49, which isn't included, so 0.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nSo, 4's:2+0+0=2.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\nUnits place: floor(20/10)=2, and 20 mod10=0, which is less than 8, so 2.\n\nTens place:0.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nSo, 8's:2.\n\nDifference:0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: 50-page book.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits:5 (4,14,24,34,44).\n\nTens:40-49:10.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 4's:5+10=15.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits:5 (8,18,28,38,48).\n\nTens:40-49: none, since tens digit is 4, not 8.\n\nWait, no, tens digit 8 would be 80-89, which is beyond 50, so 0.\n\nSo, 8's:5.\n\nDifference:15-5=10.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits 4's: floor(50/10)=5, and 50 mod10=0, which is less than 4, so 5.\n\nTens 4's: floor(50/100)=0, but in 1-50, 40-49 is included, so 10.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nSo, 4's:5+10=15.\n\nUnits 8's: floor(50/10)=5, and 50 mod10=0, which is less than 8, so 5.\n\nTens 8's: floor(50/100)=0, and 80-89 is beyond 50, so 0.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nSo, 8's:5.\n\nDifference:15-5=10. Correct.\n\nSo, my method seems to work.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each range contributes 10 except the last, which contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the last 4 in the units place would be 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 times. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 49? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, and the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 pages) plus 8 more pages. So, 48 full cycles would give 48 instances of 4 in the units place, and then in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 480, there are 480 pages, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 times 4 in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages, the units digits are 1-8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that makes sense. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: from 1-99, 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199, 140-149 is another, another 10. From 200-299, 240-249, another 10. From 300-399, 340-349, another 10. From 400-488, 440-449 is another range, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. So, numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, from 400 to 488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 instances. So hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position separately: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but with 8's. So numbers ending with 8: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? Each 10 pages, there's one such number. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then the last partial cycle from 481-488 includes 488, which ends with an 8. So units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, numbers where the tens digit is 8. These are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, but the units digit goes from 0-8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). So for the tens place, 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial range of 9 (480-488). So that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. So tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (4's):**  \n   - From 1 to 488, every 10 pages include a number ending with 4.  \n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 pages (480 pages) contributing 48 instances.  \n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more.  \n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (4's):**  \n   - Ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.  \n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (4's):**  \n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.  \n   - This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).  \n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (8's):**  \n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 pages include a number ending with 8.  \n   - 48 full sets contribute 48 instances, and the last 8 pages include 488.  \n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (8's):**  \n   - Ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - The first four ranges contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - The last range (480-488) has 9 numbers.  \n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (8's):**  \n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (max is 488).  \n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let's see how many such numbers there are. Starting from 4 and going up by 10 each time: 4, 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94, 104, 114, ..., 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last number with a 4 in the units place is 484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. The formula for the number of terms is ((last - first) / difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, where the digit is 4. These numbers would be 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Let's count how many numbers are in each range. Each range has 10 numbers, so 10 per each hundred. From 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 numbers. But wait, each of these contributes one 4 in the tens place, so that's 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many terms. First term 8, last term 488. Common difference 10. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit being 8. These are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count: Each range has 10 numbers, so 4 ranges: 40 numbers. But wait, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 in the 400s is only 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 9 (480-488) = 39. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, and 380-389 is 10. But 480-488 is 9. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49? Wait, no, because 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 are four sets of 10, that's 40. Then 480-488 is 9, so total 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, that can't be because 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9, so that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. Wait, but when I count 80-89, that's 10, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. So, numbers from 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4 and 8 to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. As 484 is the last one, the number of terms is ((484-4)/10)+1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 400-488. 488-400+1=89. Correct.\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so 0. Correct.\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for 8's? Because in the hundreds place for 4's, I had 89, but for 8's, in the hundreds place, it's 0. Wait, but in the tens place for 8's, when I count 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 1 set of 9 (480-488), totaling 49. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I included all the correct ranges. For example, in the units place for 8's, the last number is 488, which is correct. So, 488 is included, so the count is correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? The first occurrence is at 4, and the last is at 484. To find how many, I can take 484, subtract 4, and then divide by 10, then add 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but does 484 count as the 49th? Let me check: 4 is the 1st, 14 is the 2nd, ..., 484 is the 49th. Yes, that seems right. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how about the tens place? The digit 4 in the tens place would be numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many sets of 100 there are where the tens digit is 4. From 1-488, the hundreds digits go from 0 (for 1-99) to 4 (for 400-488). So, for each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. From 0-99: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but that's not correct because each number in 400-488 has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 to 488 is 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers are there?\n\nStarting at 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, the first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it, but 489 is beyond 488, so we stop at 488.\n\nSo, each hundred block where the tens digit is 8 contributes 10 numbers. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, how many numbers is that? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, in the hundreds place, the 400-488 block only has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. So, 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when counting the 4's, I had 188, and now 8's are 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 8's in the tens place. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 4 blocks of 10 (each contributing 10) and one block of 9, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Units place: 49, Tens:50, so 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, so 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the 4's would be more, but 90 seems a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, another way: For each digit position, count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 in units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49.\n\n- 8's: Similarly, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but the last 8 in units place is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). There are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit can go up to 8, so 400-488 includes 400-409 (tens digit 0), 410-419 (1), ..., 480-488 (8). So, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, but 400-409 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 5 hundreds (0-4), so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is the fifth hundred, but in that hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10.\n\nSo, 50 times in the tens place for 4's.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n\n- Similarly, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last hundred (400-488). In the last hundred, the tens digit goes up to 8, but only up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, for 8's in the tens place: 4 hundreds (0-3) contribute 10 each, and the 4th hundred (400-488) contributes 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\n- 8's: No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me confirm the hundreds place for 4's: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nAnd for the 8's in the tens place, in the last hundred, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49, which is correct.\n\nSo, yeah, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in sequences like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in sequences like 80-89, 180-189, etc., but in the 400-488 range, it only appears 9 times (480-488), totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one such number. So, how many sets of 10 are there in 488? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page. The last number with 4 in the units place would be 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, from 4 to 484, that's 49 numbers, right? Because starting from 4, each 10 pages add another 4. So, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Let me check: 484 is the 49th number because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we start counting from 0, it's actually 48 times 10 plus 4, which is 484, so that's 49 instances. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think: from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of times 4 is the last digit. So, for each ten, there's one such number. The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. How many are there? Well, 484 is the last one, so 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how about the tens place? The tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one set. Then 140-149: that's another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many sets? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. But wait, let me check the last set: 440-449. The book goes up to 488, so 449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 sets, 10 each, so 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but I'm only counting the hundreds digit, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so the last one is 488. So, how many numbers? Let's see, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms here is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this range. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: that's one set, 10 numbers. 180-189: another set, 10 numbers. 280-289: another set, 10 numbers. 380-389: another set, 10 numbers. 480-488: that's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9, so 49 times. Wait, no, let me think again. Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 x 10 = 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8. So, numbers from 800 to 899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " So, in the range 1-488, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, from 1-488, how many sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 would be the last one with a 4 in the units place. So, that's correct, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how about the tens place? The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Let's see: The first set is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would end at 449, and since the book goes up to 488, that's still within the range. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each where the tens digit is 4. Each set contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is the sum of units, tens, and hundreds places: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 48 + 50 is 98, and 98 + 89 is 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, the last set is 481-488, where the units digits go up to 8, so 488 would be included. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no. Wait, when you divide 488 by 10, you get 48.8, meaning there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490). But since the book ends at 488, the last full decade is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, does that affect the count? Hmm, actually, each decade from 1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490 has exactly one 8 in the units place, except the last one, which only goes up to 488. So, in 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 488 is included, which has an 8. So, that's still one 8 in the units place for the last partial decade. Therefore, total units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (from 481-488), totaling 49. Wait, but earlier when I thought about 4's, I thought 48 times. But for 8's, does it actually end up being 49? Let me think. From 1-480, how many 8's in the units place? 480 / 10 = 48, so 48 times. Then from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, total 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how about the tens digit being 8. That happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many such sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in tens place. Similarly, each subsequent hundred has another 10, so 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: each contributes 10. That's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit being 8. That would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because earlier, for 4's, we had 187, and 8's being 98 would mean 187 - 98 = 89 more 4's. But let me double-check my counting because that seems a bit high. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the units place for 8's. Let me go through it again. Units place: 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The number of times is equal to the number of complete decades plus any extra in the last partial decade. Number of complete decades is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). Each complete decade has one 8. So, 48 \u00d7 1 = 48. Then, in the last partial decade, 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 488 is included, which has an 8. So, that's one more, making it 49. So, units place: 49. Tens place: As before, 49. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's. Now, number of 4's was 187. So, 187 - 98 = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 5 sets of 10, so 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds: 0. So, 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check the tens place again. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 10 8's each, totaling 40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place: 49. So, total 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Let's think about how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, ..., 474). So that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 484 is in this range, which has a 4 in the units place. So that's one more. So total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 times 4 in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, adding that, 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but wait, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is correct, so that's another 10. So total 4's in the tens place: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. 400 is the first, then 401, up to 488. So yes, 89 numbers. So 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's.\n\nSimilarly, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Similar to the 4's, each group of 10 has one 8. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Now, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred has a set where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 1-400, how many such sets are there? Well, 400 / 100 = 4, so 4 sets. Each contributes 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but wait, our range is up to 488, so that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So total 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, from 481-488, 484 has a 4 in units, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times. From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10, total 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, 488 has an 8 in units, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times. From 1-400, 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so +9, total 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: No 8's, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the tens place in 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's tens place: From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's tens place: From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. But 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, 9 times. So, 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. Let me confirm: 488 - 400 +1 =89. Correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, hundreds place is 0 because the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nSo, yes, the counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? Because 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 400 is the first, and 488 is the last, so 89 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, I think the calculations are correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4. There are 48 complete groups (1-480), contributing 48 fours.\n   - The remaining numbers (481-488) include 484, adding one more 4.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, contributing 40 fours.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, contributing 10 fours.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. There are 89 such numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each group of 10 contributes one 8. There are 48 complete groups (1-480), contributing 48 eights.\n   - The remaining numbers (481-488) include 488, adding one more 8.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, contributing 40 eights.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, contributing 9 eights.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers in the 800s, so no eights here.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4,14,24,... up to 484. So, let's see. The first occurrence is at 4, then every 10 after that. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last page is 488, so does 488 have a units digit? Yes, 488 has 8 as the units digit, so 488 doesn't add a 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, the numbers ending with 4 are 4,14,24,...,484. Let me see how many terms there are in this sequence. The first term is 4, and the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so I was wrong earlier. It's 49 times. Because 484 is the 49th term. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit. The 4 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't have to consider that. Let me count how many such blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, all these blocks are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8, so that's included. So, the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, number of terms = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is included. Let's count how many such blocks. Each block is 10 numbers. So, 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me check if I counted correctly in each place. Units place for 4's: from 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers, correct. Tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks, so 5*10=50, correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place:8,18,...,488, which is 49 numbers, correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49, correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, adding up, 49+50+89=188. And for 8's, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term 4, the last term 484, and common difference 10.\n   - Number of terms = ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 4 appears in numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of terms = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term 8, the last term 488, and common difference 10.\n   - Number of terms = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks each contribute 10 8's, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 8's.\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Since the book has 488 pages, the last page with a 4 in the units place is 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10. There are 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, the last page is 488, so 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So, starting from 4, every 10 pages, there's a 4. So, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 times. But wait, actually, the first occurrence is 4, which is the 1st, then 14 is the 2nd, and so on up to 484, which would be the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 4. Wait, maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 is in the units digit. So, for every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, how many groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. But then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included. So, that's one more 4. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, 4 appears in the tens digit. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the blocks are 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (2nd), 240-249 (3rd), 340-349 (4th), and 440-449 (5th). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, for the hundreds place, 4 appears in the hundreds digit. This would be for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears in the units digit every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see, from 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the units digit. So, every 10 numbers, once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's one more 8. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens digit being 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the book. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89 (1 block), 180-189 (2nd), 280-289 (3rd), 380-389 (4th), and 480-488 (5th). So, 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last block, which only goes up to 488, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, for the block 480-488, there are 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The fifth block, 480-488, contributes 9 8's. So, total in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, for the hundreds digit being 8. The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. I thought that 480-488 is 9 numbers, but actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 in the tens place for 8's. Units place: 49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct. And for 8's, the hundreds place is 0, correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the tens and units, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me try another approach for units place. For 4's in units place: The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, correct. For 8's in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. Similarly, ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. For 4's in tens place: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is another block where the tens digit is 4, but only up to 488. Wait, no, the tens digit being 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, except the last one, 440-449, which is entirely within 488. So, 5\u00d710=50. Correct. For 8's in tens place: Similarly, 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 5 blocks, but the last block only has 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct. So, I think my initial calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 4's, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Since 488 is the last page, the last 4 in the units place would be 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then 8 more pages (481-488). But in the units place, the next 4 would be 484, which is within 480-488. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from 1 to 480) plus one more at 484, making it 49. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. The number of complete sets is 488 // 10 = 48, and the remainder is 8. So, in each of the 48 complete sets, there's one 4, so 48 * 1 = 48. Now, in the incomplete set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 is within this range (484), so that's one more. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens digit being 4. This occurs in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the following ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes. So, 50 times 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, every number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's check. From 1 to 488, the units digit is 8 in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and in the incomplete group (481-488), the units digit 8 is at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 numbers, but the last one, 480-488, contributes only 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, number of 8's in tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus the 480-488 range, which has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9. Total 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0. So total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (4):** Occurs every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n   - Total: 48 full groups of 10 (48 * 1 = 48) + 1 in the incomplete group (484) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (4):** Occurs in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 numbers.\n   - Total: 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (4):** Occurs in 400-488, contributing 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (8):** Occurs every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total: 48 full groups of 10 (48 * 1 = 48) + 1 in the incomplete group (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (8):** Occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers).\n   - Total: 4 ranges * 10 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (8):** No page numbers in 800-899, so 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, every 10 numbers have one such number. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, that's 48 times. But wait, when I think about it, from 1 to 488, the number of units digits is 488 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last number, so does the 48th cycle end at 480, and then 481-488 is the 49th cycle. So, in the 49th cycle, does 484 fall within this? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that would be the 49th occurrence. Wait, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me recalculate. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens plus one if the last number is beyond that. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, plus one if the last digit is 4 or beyond. Since 488 ends with 8, which is beyond 4, so we add one more. Wait, no, because the last number ending with 4 is 484, which is within 480-489. Wait, no, 488 is the last number, so the last number ending with 4 is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, maybe it's 49 times. Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. So, in the units place, 4 appears 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? That would be numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 is not fully included, but since 488 is the last page, 480-488 is part of the tens place. Wait, no, the tens place is the second digit from the right. So, for example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4. Similarly, in 140-149, the tens digit is 4, and so on. So, how many full groups of 100 are there? From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, no, 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, in each hundred, there are 10 occurrences. How many hundreds are there? Up to 400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? That's numbers from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) gives 188. Now, let me check if I did that correctly. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, it's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? That's numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. How many hundreds are there? Up to 488, so 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check: 40 from the first four hundreds, and 9 from 480-488. So, 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? That's numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, that's correct.\n\nAnd for the 8's, in the tens place, I had 49, which includes the 480-488 range, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and with 5 hundreds (including partial), totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is '4' for 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and with 4 hundreds plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit cycle through 0-9. For each group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many such groups are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full group, the digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does the digit 4 appear here? Yes, in 484. So that's one more time. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens digit. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't count that. Let's count how many full groups there are. Each hundred has one group where the tens digit is 4. So from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? There are 4 hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, for 1-99: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 groups of 10, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 5 groups \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me check: from 40-49: 10, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Yes, that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, the last partial group is 481-488, which has units digits from 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. So, each group where the tens digit is 8 contributes 10 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count how many such groups. Each hundred has one group where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488: which is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 = 9). Wait, so in the 400s, the tens digit 8 runs from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many 8's in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 full groups of 10 and one partial group of 9. So, total 10\u00d74=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4.\n   - There are 48 full groups (480 numbers) and a partial group (481-488).\n   - 48 full groups \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - Partial group contributes 1 (484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each group of 100 numbers has a sequence where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 5 such groups (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each group contributes 10 4's.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 8.\n   - 48 full groups and a partial group (481-488).\n   - 48 full groups \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - Partial group contributes 1 (488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each group of 100 numbers has a sequence where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 full groups (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and a partial group (480-488).\n   - Full groups contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Partial group (480-488) contributes 9 (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, for example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first number is 4, and the last is 484. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 = 4, common difference d = 10, and last term an = 484. The formula for the nth term is an = a1 + (n-1)d. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. So, 4 appears 49 times in the units place. Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, does 484 exist? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count each range. - 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times. - 140-149: another 10. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book has 488 pages, 449 is within 488, so yes. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, let's see: from 400 to 488, inclusive. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the places for 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4, every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check the last number. 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many terms there are. Using the same formula: an = a1 + (n-1)d. Here, a1=8, d=10, an=488. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the range. Let me check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. - 180-189: 10 times. - 280-289: 10 times. - 380-389: 10 times. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each, and 1 range with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 times. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89: yes, 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, total 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the places for 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 times. So, digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n- **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with 49 terms.\n- **Tens Place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10 terms, totaling 50 terms.\n- **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 terms.\n  \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n- **Units Place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 terms.\n- **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think, from 1 to 488, how many times does a 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's a 4 in the units place. So, for example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Let's see. From 1 to 488, the number of tens is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). But wait, actually, the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9 is 48 full cycles (from 1 to 480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each full cycle of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 full cycles would give 48 fours, and in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's no 4 in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 450-459 isn't, right? Wait, no, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Let me count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, there are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in 1-100, 140-149 in 101-200, etc.). So that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So that's 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 401-488 is the fifth hundred, but it's only 88 numbers. So, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each hundred. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total in tens place is 4 sets \u00d7 10 (from 1-400) plus 10 from 401-488, totaling 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89). Let me add that up: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, so from 1-488, how many full tens are there? 48 full tens (1-480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each full ten, there's one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. In the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last block, totaling 49. Wait, no, wait. 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how about the hundreds digit? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me verify each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right because 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last, so that's 89 pages. Similarly, for the tens place of 4's, we had 50, which includes 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. Wait, earlier I thought it was four sets, but actually, from 1-400, there are four sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), and then 440-449 in 401-488, so that's a fifth set. So, 5\u00d710=50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, the calculations seem accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (4):**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, contributing 48 fours.\n   - From 481 to 488, no additional 4's in the units place.\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48.\n\n2. **Tens Place (4):**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each contributes 10 fours, except 440-449, which is within 488.\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (4):**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (8):**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 480, 48 sets of 10 contribute 48 eights.\n   - From 481 to 488, 8 appears once (at 488).\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place (8):**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each contributes 10 eights, except 480-488, which contributes 9.\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (8):**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see how many such numbers there are. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first number ending with 4 is 4, and the last is 484. To find how many, I can calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1. Let me compute that: (484 - 4) = 480, 480/10 = 48, so 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many complete sets of 100 there are in 488. Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, it's 89 numbers. So, for the tens place being 4, each full hundred contributes 10 numbers. So, for 100-199: 140-149 is 10 numbers. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. But wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's okay. So, total 40 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. This happens in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178. So, total 4's printed: 178. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Numbers ending with 8. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Numbers where the tens digit is 8. These are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers. How many full hundreds are there? 488 is 4 hundreds. So, 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 sets, so 4*10=40. But wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. So, 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480-488). So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. 800 would be beyond 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 178 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 80.

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra if the last partial decade has a 4. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times. But wait, does the 48th decade end at 480, and the next numbers go up to 488, which is within the 480-489 range. So, 484 is within this range, so that's another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full decades, each with one 4 in the units place, and then the 48th decade goes up to 480, and then 481-488. So, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, adding one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, but wait, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's think differently. The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 pages: 14, 24, ..., 484. So, the sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many terms there are, we can calculate ((484 - 4)/10) + 1. That's (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these decades contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such decades are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, contributing 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, 4 in tens place. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So, that's 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. So, numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, total 4's: units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's see. Numbers ending with 8: 8,18,28,...,488. How many are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then the last partial decade from 481-488 includes 488, which ends with 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. Alternatively, the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, numbers where the tens digit is 8. These are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each of these decades contributes 10 numbers, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, tens digit 8. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so tens digit 8 for 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 decades with 10 each, and the last one with 9. So, 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me think again. From 0 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The decades are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book stops at 488, so there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units + tens + hundreds =49 +49 +0=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. And for 8's in the tens place, I had 49, but let me check again. The decades are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, units place for 8's is 49. So, 49+49=98. So, the difference is indeed 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo find this, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, how many times does a 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Let me divide 488 by 10. 488 \u00f7 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. But wait, each group of 10 has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes up to 8. So, 484 is in this group, which is the 48th group. So, that's 48 times. But wait, let me check: the first 4 is at 4, then 14, 24,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me recalculate. If I have 488 pages, the last page is 488. So, the last number ending with 4 is 484. So, starting from 4, each step of 10. So, how many terms? It's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. Hmm, so earlier I thought 48, but actually, it's 49. I need to be careful here. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 isn't fully included because the book ends at 488. So, let's see: Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, in the first hundred (1-100), it's 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149: another 10. In 201-300, 240-249: 10. In 301-400, 340-349: 10. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449: that's 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total for tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +10 = 50. Wait, but wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 401-488. Yes, 440 is greater than 401, and 449 is less than 488. So, 10 numbers. So, total 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units digit? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28,..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes, because the page numbers go up to 488. So, let's see: starting from 8, each step of 10. So, how many such numbers? Let me calculate. The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28,..., up to 488. So, how many terms? Let's see, the last term is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens digit? The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. So, let's count each hundred block: - 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. - 101-200: 180-189: 10. - 201-300: 280-289: 10. - 301-400: 380-389: 10. - 401-488: 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds digit? The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0 = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):** There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):** There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place (400-488):** There are 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):** There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):** There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let's think about how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The first occurrence is at page 4, then 14, 24, 34, and so on up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does that include all the 4's? Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because starting from 0, 4 is the first, 14 is the second, etc. Wait, no, actually, from 0 to 488, there are 489 numbers, but since we're starting from 1, it's 488 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place? Let me see: 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. For each set of 10 consecutive numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does that mean the 48th set ends at 480, and then 481-488 is an incomplete set. But in the incomplete set, does 484 fall into this? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's would be 48 (from the complete sets) plus 1 (from the incomplete set), making it 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so let me check: 480 is the last number of the 48th set, then 481-488 is 8 numbers. In this range, 484 is the only number ending with 4. So, yes, that's one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 +1 =49. Hmm, so 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each with one 4, so 48, plus the incomplete set which has one more 4, so total 49. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's think about numbers where the tens digit is 4. These numbers are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within range, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so 440-449 is the last set. Let me count how many numbers have 4 in the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (from x40 to x49). So, from 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149:10. From 200-299:240-249:10. From 300-399:340-349:10. From 400-488:440-449:10, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. Wait, but from 400-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total tens place 4's: 5 sets *10=50. So, 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4. So, numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: How many times does 8 appear in the units digit from 1-488. Similar to the 4's, each set of 10 has one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the incomplete set from 481-488, the last number is 488, which ends with an 8, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place: How many times does 8 appear in the tens digit? The numbers where tens digit is 8 are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the range. So, let's count:\n\nFrom 0-99:80-89:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199:180-189:10.\n\nFrom 200-299:280-289:10.\n\nFrom 300-399:380-389:10.\n\nFrom 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488).\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) and then 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9. So, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds digit? The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's:0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, let me confirm. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place:49. Because from 1-488, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place, and the last partial set (481-488) has one more 4 (484). So, 48 full sets +1=49.\n\n- Tens place:50. Because 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets *10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place:89. Because 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49. Each 10 numbers contribute one 8, and the last partial set (481-488) includes 488, which ends with 8, so 48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place:49. From 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets are 10 each, and the last set is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place:0.

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let's see how many such numbers there are. Since 488 is the last page, the highest number ending with 4 is 484. To find how many 4's are in the units place, I can divide 484 by 10 and take the integer part. 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, so there are 48 occurrences. But wait, starting from page 4, each 10 pages adds one more 4 in the units place. Let me check: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 4, then every 10 pages after that. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, meaning 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, yes, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? Each hundred has one range where the tens digit is 4. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there? From 0 to 488, that's five hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only part of the fifth hundred. But the tens digit being 4 in 400-488 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, each hundred contributes 10, so 5 hundreds would contribute 5\u00d710=50. But wait, 400-488 is not a full hundred, but since 440-449 is within 488, it's still 10 numbers. So, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 5\u00d710=50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. The last page is 488, which ends with 8. So, starting from 8, every 10 pages. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, meaning 48 times, plus the last one at 488. Wait, no, 8 is the first, then 18, 28,...,488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 8, the last term is 488, common difference 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. Wait, but earlier for 4's in units place, I had 48. So, 8's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges and how many numbers in each. Each hundred has one range where the tens digit is 8. So, 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199:180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the first four hundreds (0-399), each contributes 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, the last partial hundred (400-488) contributes 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 0,1,2,3,4. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Hmm, this is a discrepancy. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, when I divide 484 by 10, I get 48.4, which truncates to 48, but actually, the number of terms is 48 +1=49 because it starts at 4. So, perhaps my initial count was wrong. Let me recalculate.\n\nFor units place of 4:\n\nThe first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by not adding 1. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, I had 49, which is correct because the last term is 488, which is included.\n\nSo, correcting the 4's count:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nWait, that's different from before. I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me recast this.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the counts. Let me recount the 4's.\n\n1. Units place:\n\nNumbers ending with 4 from 1 to 488: 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nThe number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place:49\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nNumbers where tens digit is 4: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449.\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). In each of these, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times except maybe the last one.\n\nWait, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, each hundred contributes 10, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\nNumbers where hundreds digit is 4: 400-488, which is 488-400+1=89 numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nEarlier, I had 187 because I thought units place was 48, but it's actually 49. So, that was an error.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's:98\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me double-check the tens place for 8's. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nEach of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40+9=49, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10, and there are 5 hundreds, so 50.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 89, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it's 90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book is 188, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

But wait, from 1 to 488, the last page is 488, which is 48*10 + 8. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 include a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with 8. So, actually, the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, that's 48 times. But wait, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let me think differently. The first number ending with 4 is 4, and the last is 484. The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, 49 times. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me check with an example. From 1 to 100, how many numbers end with 4? 4,14,24,...,94. That's 10 numbers. Similarly, from 101 to 200, 104,114,...,194: another 10. So, up to 400, that's 40 numbers. Then from 401 to 488, the numbers ending with 4 would be 404,414,...,484. How many? Let's see: 404 is the first, then 414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So total from 401-488 is 9. So total from 1-488 is 40 (from 1-400) +9=49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me check how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, for 1-488, how many hundreds do we have? Let's see: 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) 100-199:140-149 (10) 200-299:240-249 (10) 300-399:340-349 (10) 400-488:440-449 (10) Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total is 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's okay. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? That's for numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +50 +89 = 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, but let's check. From 1-488, numbers ending with 8: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms. The first term is 8, last term is 488. The difference between terms is 10, so number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? That's numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's calculate each range: 80-89:10 numbers 180-189:10 280-289:10 380-389:10 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, because 488-480=8, so 8+1=9). So total in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? That's for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "hit_max_tokens": false,
    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last set would be 480-488. In 480-488, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, there are 49 times the digit 4 appears in the units place. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, but 488 is 488, so the units digit cycles every 10. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first one is 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. The last one is 484 because 494 would be beyond 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1=4, common difference d=10, and last term an=484. The formula for the nth term is an = a1 + (n-1)d. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n=49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so 440-449 is the last set. Let's count how many full decades we have. Each set of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? 440,441,...,449. So, yes, 10 numbers. So, the tens digit 4 appears 50 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nThat's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first number with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nAgain, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, but let's see. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. Let's use the arithmetic sequence formula. First term a1=8, common difference d=10, last term an=488. So, an = a1 + (n-1)*d \u2192 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 488 is included, so the last term is 488, which is 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n=49. So, yes, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is only for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? Because 480-488: the tens digit is 8, and the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, that's 9 numbers. But let me check: 480 has tens digit 8, 481, etc., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, the sets are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, total is 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again: from 1-488, how many times does the tens digit 8 appear?\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, total is 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, 49 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 times.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for the units place, I had 49 4's and 49 8's. For the tens place, 50 4's and 49 8's. For hundreds, 89 4's and 0 8's. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. I had 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 5*10=50. Let me list them:\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nThat's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit 8, we have:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the units digit, I had 49 for both 4's and 8's. But for the tens digit, 4's had 50 and 8's had 49. So, the total 4's are 49+50+89=188, and 8's are 49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds digit correctly for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers. 488-400+1=89. Yes, correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, there are no numbers in the hundreds place with 8, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: maybe I missed something. Let me try a different approach. Let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: every 10 numbers, so 488//10=48 full decades, each contributing one 4, and then 488%10=8, so the last partial decade has 4 in the units place (484). So, 48+1=49.\n\n- Tens: every 100 numbers, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 488//100=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (1-88), how many numbers have tens digit 4? From 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's:40+10=50.\n\n- Hundreds: numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: every 10 numbers, so 488//10=48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and the last partial decade (480-488) has 8 in the units place at 488. So, 48+1=49.\n\n- Tens: every 100 numbers, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 488//100=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (1-88), how many numbers have tens digit 8? From 80-89, which is 10 numbers. But wait, the book ends at 488, so in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but earlier I thought it was 9, but in the overall count, I considered 480-488 as part of the tens digit 8. Wait, maybe I should adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the tens digit 8's.\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in:\n\n- 80-89:10 numbers\n- 180-189:10 numbers\n- 280-289:10 numbers\n- 380-389:10 numbers\n- 480-488:9 numbers\n\nSo, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo, units digit 8's:49, tens digit 8's:49, hundreds digit 8's:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference:90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens digit 8's again. From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 9 numbers. So, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times, not 10. So, in the overall count, it's 4 full hundreds (each with 10) and the last partial hundred with 9, totaling 49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units digit count. Let me check again.\n\nFor units digit 4's: from 1-488, how many numbers end with 4? The last such number is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10=484. So, (484-4)/10=48, so n=49. So, 49 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8's: last number is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10=488. So, (488-8)/10=48, so n=49. So, 49 numbers.\n\nSo, units digits:49 each.\n\nTens digits:4's have 50, 8's have 49.\n\nHundreds digits:4's have 89, 8's have 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears is calculated by examining each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Similarly, the digit 8's occurrences are counted. \n\n- **4's:**\n  - Units place: 49 times\n  - Tens place: 50 times\n  - Hundreds place: 89 times\n  - Total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n- **8's:**\n  - Units place: 49 times\n  - Tens place: 49 times\n  - Hundreds place: 0 times\n  - Total: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to how many full groups of 10 there are. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. But wait, in the last group, which is 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the 484 is included, so that's 48 times. Wait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when you count from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, you actually have 49 numbers. Let me confirm: 4,14,24,...,484. The difference between 484 and 4 is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, 49 times the digit 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. That happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149, another. 240-249, another. 340-349, another. 440-449, another. So that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 times, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book goes up to 488, 449 is included. So yes, 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each, so 89 times. So total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 in the units place occurs every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but let's check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is the last page, so the last number with 8 in units place is 488. So the count is from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. That occurs in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers. So total for tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. That would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So zero times. So total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0=98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

This totals 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's think about the numbers from 1 to 488. For every block of 10 numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears once in the units place. How many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each full block, 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the last partial block (481-488), we have 484, which has a 4 in the units place. So that's one more. So total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 101-200, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, another 10 times. This pattern continues. Let me calculate how many hundreds are there in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred (401-488). In each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. Let's see: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's another 10 times. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, right? So that's another 10. So total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, which is 89 times. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's indeed 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So yes, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So total 4's are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, in each block of 10, 8 appears once. From 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Now, the last partial block is 481-488. Let's check if 8 appears in the units place here. The numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** For the tens digit, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many full hundreds we have: 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). In each, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), does the tens digit reach 8? 401-488 includes 480-488. So the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So total 8's are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. When counting 4's in the tens place, I considered 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's, so 40, plus in the partial hundred (401-488), 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So 40 + 10 = 50. That seems right. For 8's in the tens place, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So 40 + 9 = 49. That also seems correct. So the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I feel like that's a big number. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So 89 4's in the hundreds place. So total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. For 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Yeah, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 4.  \n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 \u2192 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.  \n   - Partial block (481-488): 484 has a 4 \u2192 1 more.  \n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.  \n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88 \u2192 4 full blocks, each contributing 10 \u2192 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - Partial block (401-488): 440-449 contributes 10 \u2192 10.  \n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - Numbers 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.  \n   - 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 occurrences.  \n   - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 8.  \n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 \u2192 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.  \n   - Partial block (481-488): 488 has an 8 \u2192 1 more.  \n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.  \n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88 \u2192 4 full blocks, each contributing 10 \u2192 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - Partial block (401-488): 480-488 contributes 9 (since 488 is included) \u2192 9.  \n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).  \n   - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

But for the units place, each 10 numbers contribute exactly one 4, so from 1 to 480, that's 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, adding one more 4. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1 to 480, how many 4's in the units place? It's 48 because 480 divided by 10 is 48. Then, from 481 to 488, the next 4 in units place would be 484, which is the 48th 4 in the units place. So, actually, it's 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that would be 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, and then one more in 484, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and so on. So, let's calculate how many such blocks there are up to 488. The first block is 40-49: 10 numbers. The next is 140-149: another 10. Then 240-249: another 10, and 340-349: another 10. Now, the next block would be 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check the upper limit. The book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is fine, but what about beyond that? The next block would be 540-549, but 540 is beyond 488, so we don't count that. So, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. For example, 40-49: 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is included, and 488 is included, so the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nSimilarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many 8's in the units digit from 1 to 488. Every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many 8's in the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks there are.\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 180-189: another 10.\n- 280-289: another 10.\n- 380-389: another 10.\n- 480-488: how many numbers here? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 4 blocks of 10, which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from the last partial block, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me make sure: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 8's: 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 98 in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. Let me check again. For the tens place, the blocks where the tens digit is 4 are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks * 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks are full, each contributing 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. When counting the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct? Because 488 - 400 +1=89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the 8's in the hundreds place again. Since the book only goes up to 488, there's no page number starting with 8, so 0 8's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. The number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 90, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to check: let's consider the number of digits printed. Each page from 1-9: 1 digit each, 9 pages. 10-99: 2 digits each, 90 pages. 100-488: 3 digits each, 389 pages. So total digits: 9*1 + 90*2 + 389*3 = 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits. But I don't know if that helps, but just to confirm that I'm not missing something.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check the counts again more carefully.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4,14,...,484. So, how many? From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in units place is floor(488/10) = 48, plus 1 if 488 >= 4 mod 10. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 >= 4 + (48)*10 = 484, so yes, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, actually, for the tens digit being 4, it's in each hundred block. So, in 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. In 100-199: 140-149:10. In 200-299:240-249:10. In 300-399:340-349:10. In 400-488:440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 8,18,...,488. So, floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if 488 >=8 +48*10=488. Since 488 is exactly 488, so yes, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: in each hundred block, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, in 0-99:80-89:10. In 100-199:180-189:10. In 200-299:280-289:10. In 300-399:380-389:10. In 400-488:480-488:9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, as before.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me figure out how many such numbers there are. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one such number. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the total number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a number, it's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last number, so the 48th group ends at 480, and then the next group starts at 481, but 484 is within 481-490, which is the 49th group. So actually, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last number ending with 4 in the units place. So, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, maybe it's 48 times. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The first number ending with 4 is 4, which is the 1st occurrence. Then 14 is the 2nd, 24 the 3rd, and so on. Each 10 numbers add one more. So, from 1 to 488, how many such numbers are there? It's the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, but since 488 is not a multiple of 10, we have an extra number. Wait, no, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, meaning there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last group would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, does that affect the count? Hmm, no, because 484 is within 480-489, so that's still the 48th occurrence. Wait, but 484 is the 48th number ending with 4. So, actually, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but let me check with smaller numbers to see if my approach is correct. For example, from 1 to 20, how many 4's in the units place? They are 4,14, which is 2 times. 20 divided by 10 is 2, so that works. From 1 to 30, it's 3 times: 4,14,24. So, yes, it's the integer division of the total number by 10. So, applying that, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, meaning 48 times. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, how many ranges? 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall entirely within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, there's an 8. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 times. Wait, but let's check: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Hmm, so maybe it's 49 times. Wait, let me think again. The first occurrence is 8 (1st), then 18 (2nd), ..., up to 488 (49th). So, 49 times. Because 488 is included, so it's 49. So, units place: 49 8's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, numbers where the tens digit is 8. These are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the range. So, how many such ranges? 5 ranges: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would be numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. 187-98=89. That seems correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4. \n   - Total occurrences: \u230a488 / 10\u230b = 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Numbers where the tens digit is 4 occur in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers from 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.\n   - Since 488 ends with 8, total occurrences: \u2308488 / 10\u2309 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Numbers where the tens digit is 8 occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - The first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Let's see. The first occurrence is 4, and the last occurrence is 484. To find how many numbers there are, I can take (484 - 4)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 fours in the units place. Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So, 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. So, numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Numbers ending with 8: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Let's check: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers. So, how many ranges? 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges with 10 each and one range with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be 800-899, but since the book is only 488 pages, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90.

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, the last page is 488, so 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So, from 4 to 484, that's 48 times. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence. Hmm, actually, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, the 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49: that's one range, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, but 540-549 would be beyond, but we don't have that. So, yes, 5 ranges, so 50 times. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is 440, 441, ..., 449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 ranges, 10 numbers each, so 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4, which is every number from 400 to 488. So, how many 4's are in the hundreds place? Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Hmm, wait, let me check that again. Units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's included in the 48. So, 48 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's each. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last range, so 49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 40 occurrences, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see how many such numbers there are. Since the book goes up to 488, the last number with a 4 in the units place is 484. So, how many numbers is that? The first is 4, then every 10 after that. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 484 is the 49th term. But does 484 fall within 488? Yes, it does. So, 49 times the digit 4 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 would have 4 in the hundreds place, but the tens digit would be 8, right? So, let's count how many sets of 100 have 4 in the tens place. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers as well. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 times. So, 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. That would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 in the units place occurs every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last number with 8 in units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's compute. The first is 8, then every 10 after that. So, from 8 to 488, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is 488, which is 8 in the units place, so yes, 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. 8, 18, 28,..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many such sets there are.\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, another 10.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's: 10 +10+10+10+9=49 times.\n\nWait, let me add that up: 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. So, 49 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, there's no page number where the hundreds digit is 8 because 800 would be way beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't miss anything in the hundreds place. Since the book is only up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, correct, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine.\n\nWait, but when counting the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8's. The last number is 488, which is included, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nHmm, but wait, when I count the units place for 4's, I included 484, which is correct, but does 488 have a 4? No, it has 8's in the tens and units place. So, the 4's in the units place go up to 484, which is correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let's compute the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: from 4,14,...,484. So, 484 is the 49th term. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 40-49 (10),140-149 (10),240-249 (10),340-349 (10),440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds:400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:8,18,...,488. 49 numbers. Correct.\n\n- Tens:80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9). Total 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds:0. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 vs 98, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Is there any overlap where both 4 and 8 appear in the same number? For example, a number like 48 would have both a 4 and an 8, but when counting the digits, each digit is counted separately. So, in 48, the 4 is in the tens place and the 8 is in the units place. So, each digit is counted in their respective positions. So, no overlap affects the counts.\n\nAnother way: Maybe I can compute the total number of digits and see if the counts make sense. Let's see, from 1 to 488.\n\nNumber of digits:\n\n- Pages 1-9:9 pages, 1 digit each:9 digits.\n\n- Pages 10-99:90 pages, 2 digits each:180 digits.\n\n- Pages 100-488:488-99=389 pages, 3 digits each:1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits:9+180+1167=1356 digits.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, 188+98=286 digits. 286 is less than 1356, so that seems plausible.\n\nWait, but maybe I can check with a smaller number to see if my method is correct. Let's say, for a book with 20 pages.\n\nPages 1-20.\n\nNumber of 4's:4,14: units place:2 times. Tens place:40-49, but 20 is less than 40, so 0. Hundreds place:0. Total 4's:2.\n\nNumber of 8's:8,18: units place:2 times. Tens place:80-89, but 20 is less, so 0. Hundreds place:0. Total 8's:2.\n\nDifference:2-2=0. Correct, as in 1-20, 4's and 8's appear equally in units place, and no tens or hundreds.\n\nAnother test: pages 1-100.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits:10 (4,14,...,94).\n\nTens:10 (40-49).\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal:20.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits:10 (8,18,...,98).\n\nTens:10 (80-89).\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal:20.\n\nDifference:0. Correct.\n\nWait, but in my original problem, the difference is 90. That seems correct based on the calculations.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe using the formula for digit counting.\n\nThe formula for counting the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n is a bit involved, but let me try to apply it for 4 and 8.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of each digit position.\n\nFor a three-digit number ABC, where A is hundreds, B is tens, C is units.\n\nWe can calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, which is a three-digit number, let's compute for each digit position.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n1. Units place:\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. How many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1, so 48*1=48. But wait, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so in the units place, 4 appears once more at 484. So, total units place 4's:48 +1=49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nIn each block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). How many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? 4 complete blocks (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remaining numbers are 401-488. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, ..., 8 for 480-488. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:40 +10=50.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\nIn each block of 1000, the hundreds digit is 4 for 100 numbers (400-499). But since we only go up to 488, it's 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n1. Units place:\n\nSimilarly, each block of 10 contributes 1. 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1, so 48*1=48. The last block is 480-488, which includes 488, so 8 appears once in units place here. So, total units place 8's:48 +1=49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nEach block of 100 contributes 10 times in the tens place (80-89). 4 complete blocks (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remaining numbers are 401-488. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 more.\n\nTotal tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\nAs before, the hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Let me calculate how many groups of 10 there are in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the 48th group ends at 480, so the next number would be 484, which is within 488. So, actually, it's 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but the number of times the units digit is 4 would be floor(488/10) = 48 times, but then we have 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many terms are there? The nth term can be found by 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 4 + 10(n-1) = 484 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. \n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges are there up to 488. \n\n- 40-49: that's 10 numbers.\n- 140-149: another 10.\n- 240-249: another 10.\n- 340-349: another 10.\n- 440-449: another 10.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units digit? Similar to 4, every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms there are. The last term is 488, so the nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens digit? Ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers.\n- 180-189: 10.\n- 280-289: 10.\n- 380-389: 10.\n- 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 480 is the first, then 481,...,488). So, that's 9.\n\nSo total for tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. Pages 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, that's correct.\n\nFor the 4's in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges, so 5*10=50. That seems right.\n\nUnits place for 4: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers, as we calculated earlier.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers.\n\nTens place for 8: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four ranges have 10 each, and the last one has 9, so 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the hundreds place, there are none, so 0.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit can be 4, but 8 in the hundreds place would require pages 800-899, which don't exist here. So, correct, 0.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let's see how many such numbers there are. Since the book has 488 pages, the last page with a 4 in the units place is 484. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 is the last page, and 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the 488th page, and 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but the last 4 in the units place would be at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the number of complete decades. From 1 to 480, that's 48 decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks exist within 1 to 488. The blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's printed: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of 8's in the units place is 49. Wait, because 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. Let's see: 8*1=8, 8*2=16, but wait, no, it's every 10 numbers. So, the count is the number of times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many terms are there? Let's see, starting at 8, each step is 10. So, the nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. We need the nth term \u2264488. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488 \u2192 (n-1)*10 \u2264480 \u2192 n-1 \u226448 \u2192 n \u226449. So, 49 terms. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block. Let's count how many such blocks are within 488. The blocks are: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, the first four blocks each have 10 numbers, and the last block has 9 numbers. So, total 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Therefore, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's printed:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's printed:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

To find the count, I can divide 484 by 10 and take the integer part. 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, so there are 48 numbers ending with 4. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? Because 48 * 10 = 480, so 480 + 4 = 484. So, 48 times. But wait, from 1 to 488, the last page is 488, so does 484 exist? Yes, because 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, 48 4's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149, another 10. From 201-300: 240-249, another 10. From 301-400: 340-349, another 10. From 401-488: 440-449, another 10. Wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? Because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks of 10, so 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. So, numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's printed are 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** Numbers ending with 8. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, does that mean 49 times? Wait, let me think. Let's take 8 as the first occurrence. Then every 10 pages, there's another 8. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be found by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's see how many blocks there are. From 1-100: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189, 10 numbers. From 201-300: 280-289, 10 numbers. From 301-400: 380-389, 10 numbers. From 401-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, for the hundreds blocks, we have 4 blocks with 10 each, and the last block with 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. So, numbers from 800-899. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the total number of times 4 appears in the units digit. Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades and a partial one (481-488). Each decade contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the partial decade from 481-488 includes 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: from 1 to 400, each hundred has 10 4's in the units place (like 4,14,24,...,394). So, 4 hundreds would have 4*10=40. But wait, 400 is included, so from 1 to 400, it's 40 4's in the units place. Then from 401 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once more at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, that's 9 times. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49 times. Okay, so units place gives 49 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many full ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the following ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. So, tens place contributes 50 4's. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. So, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the units digit is 8. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each decade (0-9) has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades and a partial one. Each full decade contributes one 8, so 48 times. The partial decade from 481-488 includes 488, which is another 8 in the units place. So, total units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but let me check again. From 1 to 400, how many 8's in units place? 400/10=40, so 40 times. From 401-488, the units digit 8 appears once at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times. So, total units digit 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many full ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, for the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers. So, total tens digit 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. 8 is not in the hundreds place because 800 would be page 800, but the book only goes up to 488. So, hundreds digit 8's: 0. So, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488)\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Each hundred has 10 numbers ending with 4 (104,114,...,194; 204,214,...,294; etc.), but I need to go up to 488. Let me calculate how many full hundreds there are. From 100-399, that's 3 hundreds. Each contributes 10 4's in the units place, so 3*10=30. Then, from 400-488, how many 4's in the units place? The numbers would be 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. Wait, 404 is the first, then every 10 up to 484, which is 484, then 494 would be next, but 494 is beyond 488, so only 9 numbers. So total units place 4's from 100-488: 30 + 9 = 39.

In 1-99, the tens place can be 4, which would be from 40-49, that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. From 100-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). How many full hundreds are there? From 100-399, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 3*10=30. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit can be 4, which would be 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's from 100-488: 30 +10=40. Adding the 10 from 1-99, total 4's in tens place: 10 +40=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? In 1-99, there's no hundreds digit, so zero. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4. So, when the hundreds digit is 4, that's from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place. So total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So total 4's printed: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** How many 8's in the units place. From 1-99, every 10 numbers has one 8, so 10 times (8,18,...,98). From 100-488, each hundred contributes 10 8's in the units place. From 100-399: 3 hundreds, each with 10 8's, so 30. From 400-488, how many 8's in units place? 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers. So total units place 8's: 10 (from 1-99) +30 +9=49. 2. **Tens place:** How many 8's in the tens place. From 1-99, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89. So 10 8's. From 100-488, each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8: e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc. From 100-399, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in tens place, so 3*10=30. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 10 (1-99) +30 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many 8's in the hundreds place. From 1-99, none. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So total hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So total 8's printed: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's) =90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the 4's again: units place: 10 (1-99) +30 (100-399) +9 (400-488) =49. Tens place:10 (1-99) +30 (100-399) +10 (400-488) =50. Hundreds place:89 (400-488). So 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place:10 (1-99) +30 (100-399) +9 (400-488)=49. Tens place:10 (1-99) +30 (100-399) +9 (400-488)=49. Hundreds place:0. So 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears 10 times in 1-99, 30 times in 100-399, and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times in 1-99, 30 times in 100-399, and 10 times in 400-488, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times in 400-488.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears 10 times in 1-99, 30 times in 100-399, and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times in 1-99, 30 times in 100-399, and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit cycle through 0-9? Well, every 10 numbers, the units digit goes from 0 to 9. So, for each 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Let me calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and 8 extra numbers. So, in each set of 10, there's one 4, so 48 times. But wait, the last set is only 8 numbers (481-488), so in that set, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does the 4 appear in the units place in that last set? Yes, because 484 is within 481-488, so that's another 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. How many times does this happen? Each time the tens digit is 4, it's for a block of 10 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within that. Let me count these blocks. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so the tens digit is 4 ten times. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Now, 488 is beyond 449, so 440-449 is the last block where the tens digit is 4. So, how many blocks is that? 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is entirely included, so yes, 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. This would be for page numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these, so that's 89 times. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, each set of 10 has one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. Let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 188. Total 8's: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (4's):**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Total complete sets of 10: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Each set contributes 1 occurrence, so 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - In the last partial set (481-488), the digit 4 appears once (at 484).\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (4's):**\n   - The tens digit is 4 in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Number of such blocks up to 488: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total tens place 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (4's):**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (8's):**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - Total complete sets of 10: 48.\n   - Each set contributes 1 occurrence, so 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - In the last partial set (481-488), the digit 8 appears once (at 488).\n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (8's):**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block.\n   - Number of complete blocks up to 488: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Each contributes 10 occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (8's):**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, which is beyond 488.\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Since the book has 488 pages, the last page with a 4 in the units place would be 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is the total number of complete decades (groups of 10) up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades. Each contributes one 4, so that's 48. But wait, the 48th decade would be 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, the last page is 488, which is part of the 48th decade. So, 48 4's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the 40-49 range, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers, correct. Then 140-149, same. Up to 440-449, which is the fifth range. So, 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive. Let's calculate that. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, there are 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's.\n\nNow, adding them all up: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. So, total number of 4's is 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? Let's see: the first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades. Each has one 8, so 48. But wait, 488 is included, so in the 48th decade (480-489), 488 is the last one. So, yes, 48 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's check each range.\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 180-189: another 10.\n- 280-289: another 10.\n- 380-389: another 10.\n- 480-488: this is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 8's in the tens place here.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The first four ranges are full decades, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 0,1,2,3,4. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the 8's: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is 187, and total number of 8's is 97. Now, subtracting the two: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 187 - 97: 187 - 90 is 97, so 97 -7=90. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one 4. There are 48 complete decades (1-480), plus 484, totaling 48 +1 =49? Wait, earlier calculation said 48, but let's correct it. Actually, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10)=48, since 488/10=48.8, so 48 times. So, 48 4's.\n- **Tens place:** The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d710=50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. 488-400+1=89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 +89=187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one 8. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete decades, so 48 8's.\n- **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges have 10 each, and the last has 9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's =48 +49=97.\n\nDifference =187 -97=90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the units place? So, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last number ending with 4 would be 484. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included. Hmm, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Wait, but 488 is the limit, so 440-449 is okay, but 480-489 would go beyond 488. So, the tens digit 4 appears in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? Yes, 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? That would be from 400 to 488, because the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units digit? From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so the last one is 488. Let's calculate how many times. So, starting at 8, every 10 numbers. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens digit? That would be in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-489 would only go up to 488. So, for each of these ranges, how many numbers? Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the end). Wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 each, and the last one (480-488) contributes 9. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds digit? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, zero times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. Total: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right. For 8's: units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. Total: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that's the calculation. But wait, let me check the tens place for 8 again. I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, it's 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So that's 5*10 = 50. That seems right. And the hundreds place for 4 is 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's, units: 49, tens: 49, so 98. 188 - 98 = 90. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit within 1-488. Occurrences: 0.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? Let me calculate 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), does the units digit include a 4? Let's see: 484 is within 481-488, so that's an additional 4. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, wait, no. Actually, each group of 10 contributes exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1-480, there are 48 groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 484 is included, adding one more 4. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that makes sense.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within the 488 pages, right? Let me check: 440-449 is 10 pages, so that's another set. So, how many sets are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond that, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units digit? Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, so from 1-488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens digit? Similar to the 4's, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's break it down:\n\n- From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers).\n- From 100-199: 180-189 (10).\n- From 200-299: 280-289 (10).\n- From 300-399: 380-389 (10).\n- From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers).\n\nSo, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So total tens place 8's: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds digit? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98 eights.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, how many more 4's than 8's? That's 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify my counts again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see, how many such numbers are there? The last one is 484, which is 484 = 400 + 84, so 84 divided by 10 is 8.4, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 8 full sets of 10. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488, plus any extra if the last number in the range has a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (from 481 to 488). In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, 48 times. Now, does the last partial group (481-488) include a 4 in the units place? Let's see: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Yes, 484 has a 4 in the units place. So that's one more. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how about the tens place? The digit 4 can appear in the tens place as part of numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449, and then 480-488. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nEach time 4 is in the tens place, it's for 10 consecutive numbers. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Now, after that, 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the tens place here. So, that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 times. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10, 140-149: 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, 440-449: 10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 times. But wait, does 480-488 have any 4's in the tens place? No, because the tens digit is 8, so no. So, total 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how about the hundreds place? The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, it's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then the last partial group 481-488. Does that last group include an 8? 488 is the last page, which ends with 8, so yes, that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Let's count how many times that is.\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 180-189: another 10.\n- 280-289: another 10.\n- 380-389: another 10.\n- 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I had 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 times, so 50. But let me list them to confirm:\n\n- 40-49: 10\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\nThat's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nAnd the hundreds place for 4's is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits was 49 each. So, yes, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is calculated by considering each digit position (units, tens, hundreds). Similarly, the number of times the digit 8 appears is calculated. \n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
