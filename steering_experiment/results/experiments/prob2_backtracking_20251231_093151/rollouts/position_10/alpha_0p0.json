    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find the total number, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups and then an extra 8 pages. So, the 48th group ends at 480, and then from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within the 480-488 range. So, that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. Starting from 0-99: 40-49 is one block. Then 100-199: 140-149. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another block. So, that's five blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. Each page number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The last 8 in the units place is at 488, so that's included. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's see how many such blocks there are. 0-99: 80-89. 100-199: 180-189. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. 400-488: 480-488. So, that's five blocks. Each block has 10 8's in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these, right? Because 480 has 8 in the tens place, and 488 also does. So, actually, each block contributes 10 8's except maybe the last one? Wait, no, because 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 8's in the tens place for that block. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, let's adjust that. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 8's in the tens place. The last block, 480-488, has 9 8's in the tens place. So, total for tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, there are 97 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, contributing 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., but the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, it appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 full groups of 10. But wait, from 1 to 488, the last group is 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the units digit 4 appears once in 484, 494, etc., but wait, 494 is beyond 488, so actually, up to 488, the units digit 4 appears how many times? Let me think. From 1 to 480, the units digit 4 appears 48 times (since 480/10 = 48). Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units digit 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers, so 10 times per range. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, the tens digit 4 appears 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units digit 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. Each of these ranges (except maybe the last one) has 10 numbers. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens digit 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would happen in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. But let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for 4's in tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449:5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Units place for 4's: up to 488, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing a 4, plus one more in 484. So, 49. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this occurs 48 times (for 1-480) plus once in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many such sets are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. Each full set contributes one 4, so that's 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, total 4's in tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which has 8 in the units place once (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's see how many blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 instead of 10. So, the first four blocks each have 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block has 9. So, total 8's in tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 400-488, the tens place 8's are in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, yes, 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9, so 49. Units place: 49. So, 98 total 8's. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: the last number with a 4 in the units place is 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, let me count them: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers because 488-400+1=89. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding them up: units place 48, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. Total number of 4's = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, there are 187 fours printed. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: from 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4*10=40 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding them up: units place 49, tens place 40, hundreds place 0. Total number of 8's = 49 + 40 + 0 = 89. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 98. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, +89=187. For the 8's: units=49, tens=40, hundreds=0. 49+40=89. 187-89=98. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought it was 48, but actually, it's 49. Because the first term is 4, the last term is 484, which is the 49th term. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. That changes things. Let me recalculate the total number of 4's. Units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. So, 49+50=99, +89=188. Now, the number of 8's was 89. So, 188-89=99. Wait, but earlier I thought the units place for 4's was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Let me confirm. The first number with a 4 in the units place is 4, which is the first term. The last is 484, which is 484=4+10*(n-1). So, n-1=(484-4)/10=480/10=48, so n=49. So yes, 49 occurrences in the units place. So, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. 8's:49 (units)+40 (tens)+0=89. So, 188-89=99. Wait, but earlier I thought the 4's units place was 48, but now it's 49. So, the correct difference is 99. But wait, let me check the 4's tens place again. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. 8's: units=49, tens=40. So, 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Therefore, there are 99 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because initially I thought units place for 4's was 48, but upon rechecking, it's 49. So, the correct answer should be 99. But wait, let me make sure I didn't overcount somewhere else. Let me recount the 4's units place: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49. So, total 4's=49+50+89=188. 8's: units=49, tens=40, hundreds=0. So, 89. 188-89=99. So, the answer should be 99. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the 8's units place. Let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The last number is 488, which ends with 8. So, how many terms? (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49. So, 8's units place=49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. Each block has 10 numbers, so 4 blocks, 4*10=40. So, total 8's=49+40=89. So, 4's=188, 8's=89. 188-89=99. Therefore, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449)  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Number of pages: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\)\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\( 49 \\) (units) \\( + 50 \\) (tens) \\( + 89 \\) (hundreds) \\( = 188 \\)\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).  \n   - Number of blocks: 4  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 0 \\)\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\( 49 \\) (units) \\( + 40 \\) (tens) \\( + 0 \\) (hundreds) \\( = 89 \\)\n\n**Calculating the difference:**  \nNumber of 4's \\( - \\) Number of 8's \\( = 188 - 89 = 99 \\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there? Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each full block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, the last partial block is 481-488. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so 4 appears once in this partial block (484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the second is 140-149, the third is 240-249, the fourth is 340-349, and the fifth would be 440-449. Wait, but 488 is beyond 449, so the fifth block is only up to 449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check. From 40-49: 10 numbers, 4 in tens place. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 in all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial block is 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks are in 488. The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), the second is 180-189, the third is 280-289, the fourth is 380-389, and the fifth would be 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the fifth block is only up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in all numbers from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, the number of 8's in the tens place is: For the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, the fifth block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go back to the 4's in the hundreds place. I thought from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each has a 4 in the hundreds place. But actually, 400-488 is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's correct, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, the fifth block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the 4's in the tens place, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct because 440-449 is within 488.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full blocks and one partial block. Wait, but 480-488 is the fifth block, right? So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the 4's in the units place, I had 48 full blocks (each 10 numbers) and then the last partial block (481-488) had one more 4 (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the units place, I had 48 full blocks and the last partial block had one 8 (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nWait, so total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again for the 4's in the tens place. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four are full blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. The fifth block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9 8's. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4. There are 48 full decades (1-480) and a partial decade (481-488).\n   - Full decades: 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - Partial decade: 484 contributes one 4.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers have a block where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149).\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, no, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the 48th multiple of 10 is 480, so the 48th occurrence of 4 in the units place would be 484? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last number, which is 48*10 + 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 488. So yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, that's another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 5*10=50. But wait, let me check. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I'm making a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. So, there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The last group is 480-488, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place as in 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the 480-488 block contributes 9 8's in the tens place, not 10. So, let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. So, total 8's are 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, checking the 4's: units place: 48, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units place:48, tens place:49, hundreds:0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. Units place:48. So, 48+50+89=187. For the 8's, units place:48. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - Number of such blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - Number of such blocks: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - The last block (480-488) has 9 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( (4 \\times 10) + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** \\( 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 187 - 97 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first number with 4 in the units place is 4, and the last is 484. To find how many numbers there are, I can divide 484 by 10, which gives 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because starting from 4 as the first. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one set, 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400 to 488. Now, how many numbers is that? Let's see, from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but wait, the page numbers go up to 488, so from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding all these up for the digit 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 gives 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers are there? The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488 with a step of 10. The count would be (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place, 4 times 10 (from the first four ranges) plus 9 from the last partial range. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. Wait, but wait, let me make sure. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the digit 4: units place: 48, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For the digit 8: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4 again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Let me confirm: 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 +1=89. Yes, that's correct. And for the tens place of 8, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, the total for 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, the difference is indeed 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4,14,24,...,484. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The last number with 4 in the units place is 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula: ((Last number - First number) / Step) + 1. Here, Last number is 484, First number is 4, and Step is 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Let's see how many such groups there are. Each group is 10 numbers, and the tens digit is 4. Let me figure out how many complete groups there are up to 488. The first group is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 groups: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each group contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 groups * 10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So yes, 5 groups, each contributing 10, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 +50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last number with 8 in units place is 488. Let's calculate how many terms. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. That would be numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-489 would only go up to 488. So, let's see how many complete groups there are. The first group is 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: let's see, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers because 488 is the last. So, for the tens place, we have 4 complete groups (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 numbers, and the last partial group 480-488 contributing 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one number ending with 4. So, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th set ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. In the 481-488 range, the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so 484 is in this range, adding one more 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in entire decades, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 is one block, 140-149 is another, 240-249 is another, 340-349 is another, and 440-449 is the last one. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all five blocks are valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial set 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, 488 is the last page, which has an 8 in the units place. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks exist up to 488. 80-89: yes, that's one. 180-189: another. 280-289: another. 380-389: another. Now, 480-489 would be the next, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of this block. But wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these, but how many 8's in the tens place? Each number from 480 to 488 has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 numbers. So, how many complete blocks? The first four blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 8's, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, the partial block 480-488 contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find out how many there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, it's 48 times. However, I should check if 488 itself ends with a 4. No, it ends with an 8, so 488 doesn't add an extra 4 in the units place. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4's appear 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 ends with an 8, so the last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the numbers ending with 8 are 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1 =49. So yes, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges with 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total tens place: 40 +9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 8's appear 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.

So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place, which would be from page 400 to 488. Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, but 488 is the last page. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many pages have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many times this happens. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, meaning 48 occurrences of 8 in the units place. The last occurrence is 488, which is included, so that's correct. Units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book ends at 488, the 480-488 pages have 8 in the tens place. Let me check: The blocks are 80-89 (10 pages), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The last block is from 480 to 488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total in the tens place: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me make sure. 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total number of 8's is 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - The last block (480-488) has 9 pages.\n   - Total occurrences: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 numbers? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But then, from 481 to 488, the last 8 numbers, we have 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, because 480 is included in the 48 blocks, so 480 is the 48th block. Then, 481-490 would be the 49th block, but since we only go up to 488, we have to check if 484 is within that range. 484 is indeed within 481-488, so that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Each full hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. From 1-488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), we have 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Again, every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles. So, in each hundred, 80-89 is where the tens digit is 8, which is 10 times. So, from 1-400, there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full blocks (480 numbers) + 1 additional number (484).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100.\n   - In each hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), there are 10 occurrences.\n   - Total in 4 hundreds: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488, 440-449 gives another 10.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total blocks: 48 full blocks + 1 additional number (488).\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100.\n   - In each hundred, there are 10 occurrences.\n   - Total in 4 hundreds: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488, 480-488 gives 9 occurrences.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 4, and the last is 484. To find how many terms there are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and a_n is the last term. Here, a_1 = 4, d = 10, a_n = 484. Plugging in: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 484 - 4 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = 10(n-1) \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times that happens. Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 times per block. So, from 1-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. Let me add these up: 10 (from 1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Wait, let me check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yes, that seems right. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, the last occurrence in the units place would be 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. Using the same formula: a_n = 488, a_1 = 8, d = 10. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 488 - 8 = 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Let me count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, same for 180-189, etc. Then 480-488 is 9, so 4 times 10 plus 9, which is 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each full block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the last partial block (481-488), does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, in 40-49, all numbers have a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, in 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another block. So, that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me check the last block: 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? As before, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks and 8 extra numbers. Each block contributes one 8, so 48. Now, in the last partial block (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 5 blocks, but the last one has only 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, so 4\u00d710=40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, each has an 8 in tens place, so 10. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, so 20. 280-289: another 10, 30. 380-389: another 10, 40. 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

Let's see, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, the blocks where the tens digit is 4 are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So, each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, how many blocks are there? Let's count: 40-49 (first block), 140-149 (second), 240-249 (third), 340-349 (fourth), and 440-449 (fifth). That's 5 blocks. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. But wait, I need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The digit 8 can appear in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks. From 0-99: 80-89 (1 block). 100-199: 180-189 (2nd block). 200-299: 280-289 (3rd block). 300-399: 380-389 (4th block). 400-488: 480-488 (5th block). So, 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place except the last one, which only goes up to 488. So, let's see: first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 8's, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 occurrences. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. With 48 full sets of 10 and an additional 4 in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., contributing 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n  \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block (480-488) contributing 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of such blocks. Let's calculate how many blocks there are. The last page is 488, so the number of blocks is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times? Wait, let me check. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). From 11-20, page 14. So yes, each 10 pages contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full blocks, and then a partial block from 481 to 488. In that partial block, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (page 484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 for every block of 100 numbers, specifically from x40 to x49, where x can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, for example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, etc. Let me calculate how many such blocks exist up to 488. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks? Wait, no, let's see: The blocks are 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. Let's see, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, and then a partial block from 481-488. In the partial block, units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like x80-x89, where x can be 0,1,2,3,4. Let's count these blocks: 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), and 400-488: 480-489. Wait, but 480-489 is within 488, so that's five blocks, each contributing 10 times the digit 8 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d710=50 times. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, not 10. Wait, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the 400-488 block, it's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's would be 4 blocks \u00d710 (from 0-399) plus 9 in the 400-488 block. So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Let me confirm: From 0-99: 80-89:10 100-199:180-189:10 200-299:280-289:10 300-399:380-389:10 400-488:480-488:9 So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that's a big difference. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last partial block (481-488), 484 has a 4, so +1, total 49. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last partial block, 488 has an 8, so +1, total 49. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers, so 4\u00d710 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full decades (1-480) contributing 48 occurrences, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like x40-x49. There are five such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full decades contributing 48 occurrences, plus one more in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like x80-x89. There are four full decades contributing 40 occurrences, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488, contributing 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many times this happens, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, the last group ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. So from 1 to 480, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's in the units place. So total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many full blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, another 10. Then 340-349, another 10. Then 440-449, another 10. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is up to 449, and 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 are included. So 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 4's. Now, adding them up: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So total number of 4's is 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each place separately. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times does this happen? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. From 1-480, that's 48 times. Then, 481-488 includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So total 48+1=49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers each time. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So total 4*10 +9=49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49+49=98. So total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first number is 4 and the last is 484. To find how many terms there are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: n = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Let me count how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, right? Let me check: 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 +1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 numbers. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 ranges, so 4*10=40. Wait, but does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, 480-488 is part of the book, but 489 isn't. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's an additional 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 40 +9=49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 49 +49=98. So, total 98 8's. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 -98=90.

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. I need to find how many such numbers there are. Since 488 is the last page, the highest number ending with 4 is 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 484 by 10, which gives 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but let me check: from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10 are there? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 pages. So, the number of 4's in the units place is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, I think my initial thought was wrong because when you divide 484 by 10, you get 48.4, but when counting inclusive, it's 49. Let me confirm: numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The total count is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so it's okay. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. But in this range, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me think: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Each has a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last page is 488, so the last number ending with 8 is 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's compute: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of it, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, but in the tens place, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 -480 +1=9? No, 488-480=8, so +1 is 9. Wait, but 480 is included, so 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488: that's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens in 488. Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete tens. So, 48 times, right? Wait, but actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears in each 10-number block. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In those extra 8 numbers, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's no additional 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. Each time the tens digit is 4, which happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 is present once more in 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Each full block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, how many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, the first four blocks each contribute 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9 8's. So, total 8's in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488 and 0-3 in 1-399. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in any page number. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 consecutive numbers has exactly one number ending with 4. So, from 1-488, there are 488 / 10 = 48 full sets of 10, which gives 48 occurrences. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there's an extra 8 pages. So, the 48th set ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. In the 481-488 range, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place beyond 480. So, 48 times is correct for the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-488 is also part of the three-digit numbers. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? Let's see: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's 5 sets. But in each of the first four sets (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers each. So, 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is fully included. So, that's another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 more. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, that can't be right because 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So, the total is 4 sets of 10 (from 1-399) plus 10 in 440-449, so 4*10 +10=50. Hmm, but wait, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit in 400-488 is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, ..., 8 for 480-488. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 total 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but I think I'm making a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 +89=187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. So, total 4's: 48 + 50 +89= 187. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4's, it's 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page. So, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once more. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range x80-x89. So, in each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? Let's see: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, 5 sets. In each of the first four sets (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit is 8 in 10 numbers each. So, 4 sets *10=40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers here. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:187, total 8's:98. So, 187 -98=89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=187-98=89. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 4's. Let me recount that. Tens place for 4's: in each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, 1-99: 40-49, 10 numbers. 100-199:140-149, 10. 200-299:240-249,10. 300-399:340-349,10. 400-488:440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For 8's, tens place: in each hundred, 10 numbers, so 4*10=40, plus in 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. That's correct. Units place for 8's: 48 full sets (48*10=480), plus 488, which is the 489th number, but since 488 is included, the units digit 8 appears once more, so 48+1=49. That's correct. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full sets, each contributing one 4.

Well, from 1 to 488, every set of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the total number of tens places. Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. Hmm, but wait, 488 is 488, so 488 is included. But 488 is 488, so the units digit cycles every 10. So, from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there?

But wait, does the 48th set end at 480, and then 481-488 is the next set, which doesn't have a 4 in the units place. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count them: - 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is only 10 numbers, so 10 4's. So total 5*10=50. But wait, 488 is 488, so 440-449 is okay. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so does that add an extra 8? 488 is 488, so the units digit is 8. So, in the 49th set, which is 480-488, the 8 in the units place occurs once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (488) = 49. Wait, but when we do 488 divided by 10, it's 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but the remainder is 8, meaning that in the last partial set (480-488), the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so 8 appears once. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, in the tens place, how many 8's? Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contribute 10 8's, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So total 8's:98.\n\nWait, but when I calculated units place, I thought it was 49, and tens place also 49, so 98 total 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many 8's in units place? It's the number of times 8 appears in the units digit. So, 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49 units place 8's.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place, how many 8's? Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block if it's incomplete. So, from 1-400, we have 4 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49. So, yes, 49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check the calculations again.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units:48\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:48+50=98+89=187.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nSo, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in each place?\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: From 1-488, every 10 numbers has a 4 in units place. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full times, but 488 is included. Wait, 488 is 488, so the last 4 in units place is 484. So, 484 is the 48th occurrence. So, units place 4's:48.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 4's in tens place. So, 5 blocks, 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place:400-488. That's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each with 4 in hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's:48+50+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:8,18,...,488. Number of terms:488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49.\n\n- Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 8's, last block has 9. So, 4*10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, since max is 488.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, in the range 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block from 481-488. In each complete block, there's one 4, so that's 48 fours. Now, in the partial block 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, in the range 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 5 * 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but the last block, 440-449, is within 488, so that's fine. So, total 4's in tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, I need to do the same for the digit 8. Let me go through each place again. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, meaning 48 complete blocks and a partial block 481-488. Each complete block gives one 8, so 48 eights. In the partial block 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks. Each contributes 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Wait, but 380-389 is within 488, so that's fine. So, total 8's in tens place: 40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89 eights. So, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 89. The difference is 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units: 48 complete blocks (1-480) give 48 fours, plus 484, so 49. Tens: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units: 48 complete blocks (1-480) give 48 eights, plus 488, so 49. Tens: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Hundreds: 0. Total 8's: 49+40=89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.\n   - Total blocks of 10: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (484) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers have a block where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49).\n   - Total such blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.\n   - Total blocks of 10: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers have a block where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89).\n   - Total such blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Each block contributes 10 eights, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 1-488 have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) = **89**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = **99**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{99}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, for every 10 numbers, it appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 times 1, plus one more if the remainder is 8 or more? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, and the units digit is 8, which is less than 4, so actually, it's exactly 48 times. Wait, no, let me think again. From 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 groups of 10, so 48 fours in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So total 48 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the 40-49 range of each hundred. So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88. So, from 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, there are 10 numbers with a tens digit of 4. So that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 0-8, so the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, right? So that's another 10. So total tens place fours are 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, because 401-488 is only part of the fifth hundred. So, in the first four hundreds, each has 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the fifth hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place fours are 40 +10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, so 48 eights in the units place. But wait, from 1-488, the last number is 488, which ends with 8, so that's an extra 8 in the units place. So, actually, it's 48 +1=49. Wait, no, because 488 is the 48th group of 10, but 488 is the last number, so the units digit cycles 48 times, and in each cycle, 8 appears once. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so in the 48th group, which is 480-488, the units digit goes from 0-8, so 8 appears once in that group. So, total units place eights are 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many hundreds are there in 488? Four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, there are 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit can be 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place eights are 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. So, total number of 8's is 97. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) -97 (number of 8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, so 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - In the range 401-488, 440-449 adds another 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, so 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - In the range 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 occurrences (since 488 is the last page).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, in each set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many such sets are there up to 488? Let me divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times. But wait, the 488th page is included, which is 488. So, in the 489th set, which is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, actually, it's 48 full sets plus one more in the incomplete set, making it 49 times. Hmm, wait, maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, for every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total number of 4's in units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48 times, but since 488 is exactly 48*10 + 8, does that mean we have an extra 4 in 484? Let me check: 484 is within 480-489, so yes, 484 is included. So, that's 48 full sets plus one more, totaling 49. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 times completely (1-480), and then from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place, from 1-480, 4 appears 48 times (since 480 /10=48). Then, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 +1=49. Okay, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and so on. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the next is 140-149 (another 10), then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 is beyond 449, so let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 end at 449, which is before 488? Yes, so all 5 blocks are fully included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but our book only goes up to 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 in each of these, so 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, for every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, each full block contributes 10 times, and the last block contributes 9 times. So, how many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full blocks and one partial block. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n- **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this happens 49 times (48 full sets of 10, plus one in 484).\n- **Tens Place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n- **Units Place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens Place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in 488 pages.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one number ending with 4. So, I can divide 488 by 10 to see how many complete sets there are. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 49th set would be from 481 to 490, but since we only go up to 488, the last set only goes up to 488. So, does that mean the 49th set has a 4 in 484? Yes, because 484 is within 481-488. So, actually, there are 49 instances where 4 is in the units place. Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. That's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. Each time, it's a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4. Similarly, from 140-149, and 240-249, and so on. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10. Then, 240-249: another 10. Next would be 340-349: another 10. Then, 440-449: another 10. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last block would be 440-449, which is entirely within 488. So, how many blocks is that? Let's count: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 instances of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, is that correct? Let me check. Each block is 10 numbers, and each contributes one 4 in the tens place per number, so yes, 10 per block. 5 blocks would give 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 starting from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 instances. Now, let's add up the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, in the 49th set, which is 481-490, we have 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's 49 times. Let me list a few: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 instances. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. Each block is 100 numbers, and within each block, the 8's in the tens place occur from X80 to X89, where X is the hundreds digit. Let's see how many such blocks we have. The first block is 80-89: 10 numbers. Then, 180-189: another 10. Then, 280-289: another 10. Next, 380-389: another 10. Then, 480-489: but our book ends at 488, so from 480-488. Wait, so in the 480-489 block, we only go up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). But in the tens place, each number from 480-488 has an 8 in the tens place, except 489, which isn't included. So, how many 8's in the tens place here? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, the blocks are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 instances. Let me confirm: Each block up to 380-389 gives 10 each, so 3 blocks give 30, plus the first two blocks (80-89 and 180-189) give 20, so total 40, plus the last block 480-488 gives 9, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, and 0-3 for pages 1-399. So, does any page number have 8 in the hundreds place? No, because 800 would be page 800, but our book ends at 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this occurs 49 times (including 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149).

The last block is 480-488, contributing 9 instances. Total: 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers has one 4. So, from 1-10: 4; 11-20:14; 21-30:24; and so on. The total number of such blocks is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks). But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last block is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So, actually, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place? Wait, let me check. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the incomplete decade. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, let's check from 1 to 488. The first 4 in units is 4, then 14, 24,... up to 484. So, how many terms are there? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. Let's set 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. Solving for n: (n-1)*10 \u2264 484 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48.4 \u2192 n \u2264 49.4. So, n=49. Wait, that's different. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's calculate it properly. The number of times 4 appears in the units place can be calculated by taking the floor division of 488 by 10, which is 48, and then checking if the last number is beyond 484. Since 488 is beyond 484, we add 1 more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again. Alternatively, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears as the last digit. So, for each 10 numbers, it appears once. From 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So total 48 +1=49. Okay, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many such sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, tens digit is 4. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? Let's see: the first set is 40-49 (40s), then 140-149 (140s), 240-249 (240s), 340-349 (340s), and 440-449 (440s). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 sets \u00d710 numbers = 50 numbers, but wait, each set contributes 10 numbers, but each set has the tens digit as 4 for all 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 5 sets \u00d71 occurrence per number = 5\u00d710=50? Wait, no. Wait, each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so each set contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d710=50. But wait, let me check the last set: 440-449. Since our book goes up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 5 sets \u00d710=50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but our book only goes up to 488, so it's from 400 to 488. So, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, let's sum up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4, it's every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Using the same logic as with 4, it's the number of complete decades plus any extra in the last partial decade. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The last partial decade is 481-488, where 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's similar to the 4's. The tens digit is 8 for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count the number of sets. The first set is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (another 10), 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four sets are complete (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. The fifth set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is 4 sets \u00d710 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: each set contributes 10 instances of 8 in the tens place. So, for the first four sets, that's 4\u00d710=40. The fifth set, 480-488, has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480-488), so 9 instances. So total tens place 8's: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, summing up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, in 1-10, it's on page 4; 11-20, it's on page 14; and so on. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, and then there's a remainder of 8. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the 48th group would end at 480, and the 481-488 would be part of the 49th group, but since 488 is less than 490, we don't get a full 10 in the 49th group. However, for the units place, each full group of 10 contributes exactly one 4, so from 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups (1-10, 11-20,..., 481-490) but since 488 is less than 490, the last group is incomplete. But wait, no, because the units digit cycles every 10, so up to 488, how many complete tens are there? Let me think: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is within that range, adding one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, actually, when you have 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 is in the units digit from 1 to 488. Each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full times plus one more because 484 is within 481-488. So 48 +1 =49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, from 400-488, 440-449 is within that, so that's correct. So total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all 89 of these numbers, so 89 times. So total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let's think again: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. So how many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So yes, units place is 49. Tens place: as above, 50. Hundreds place: 89. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's check. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included, so the last term is 488. So the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many terms. First term a=8, common difference d=10, last term l=488. The nth term is a + (n-1)d = l. So 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. (n-1)*10=480. n-1=48. So n=49. So units place 8's:49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Let's count each range: - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 100-199:180-189 (10). -200-299:280-289 (10). -300-399:380-389 (10). -400-488:480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So total tens place 8's: 4 ranges with 10 each, and one range with 9. So 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's:0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Ranges with 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 (4 ranges).\n   - Last range (480-488) has 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one number ending with 4. So, how many such sets are there? Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. Each full set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), does 484 end with a 4? Yes, 484 is included, so that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and so on. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: The first block is 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Now, after 440-449, the next block would be 540-549, but since we're only going up to 488, we don't have that. So, how many full blocks of 100 do we have? Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, from 40-499, we have 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each giving 10 4's. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 440-449, which is within 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 4's. So, 5 ranges * 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the hundreds place is only one digit, so each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. So, total 4's: units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many such numbers are there? From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, plus the last partial set. The last number ending with 8 before 488 is 488 itself, which is 488. So, 488 is included. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, each full range (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many full ranges we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 has 8, etc., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 8's, and the last partial range (480-488) contributes 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 (480 numbers) plus 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each set contributes one 4, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 4's, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4, totaling 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 plus 8 extra numbers. Each set contributes one 8, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges contributing 10 each (40) and the last range 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4,14,24,... up to 484. So, the total number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of such occurrences. To calculate this, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of 10, and then there's a remainder of 8. So, in each group, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times, but wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens and then 8 more numbers. But since 488 is the last page, the last group is from 481 to 488, and in that, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence. Therefore, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100, specifically in the 40-49 range for each hundred. So, from 1-100, 40-49 is 10 numbers. Then from 101-200, 140-149 is another 10, and so on. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, up to 400, there are four blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, the tens place is 0-8, so 40-49 would be 401-410, but wait, 401-410 is actually in the 400s, so the tens digit is 0-10? Wait, no, 401-488: the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, so 40-49 in the tens place would be 400-409, but wait, 400 is included in 401-488? Wait, no, 400 is page 400, which is included in 401-488? No, 400 is page 400, which is in the 400-488 range. Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think differently. For the tens place, each 100 numbers have a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). 101-200: 140-149 (10). 201-300: 240-249 (10). 301-400: 340-349 (10). 401-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 401-488 is only up to 488, so does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Wait, but let me check: 1-100: 10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, and 401-488:10. So, that's 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,... up to 488. Let's calculate how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so the last group is 481-488, where the units digit is 8 at 488. So, that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's see how many such blocks are there up to 488. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). 101-200:180-189 (10). 201-300:280-289 (10). 301-400:380-389 (10). 401-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 480,481,...488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) and 1 block of 9 (from 401-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. So, total 8's: 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, I can calculate how many such blocks there are. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In those extra numbers, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in the units place (484). So, total 4's in units place = 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, the 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49 in each hundred. So, in each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88. So, in each hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), there are 10 4's in the tens place. That's 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. Wait, but 488 is the end, so from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, but wait, in the hundreds place, each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus the 10 in 440-449, making it 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, no, that can't be right because 440-449 is part of the 401-500 range, which is the fourth hundred. So, maybe I'm double-counting. Let me think again. From 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 4's in tens place. From 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 another 10. From 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 another 10. From 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 another 10. From 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each block of 10 has one 8. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In those extra numbers, the units digit is 8 once (488). So, total 8's in units place = 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, 8 appears in the block 80-89 in each hundred. So, in each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. How many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (including both ends). So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 4's, I thought there were 50 4's, but let me confirm that. From 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10. 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10. 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10. 301-400: 340-349 \u219210. 401-488: 440-449 \u219210. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50. That seems correct. For 8's, in the tens place, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 +9=49, which is correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full blocks (480 numbers) + 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - 48 \u00d7 1 = 48, plus 1 more in the extra numbers (484).\n   - Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 contributes another 10.\n   - Total: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total blocks of 10: 48 full blocks + 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - 48 \u00d7 1 = 48, plus 1 more in the extra numbers (488).\n   - Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 10 each: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488), 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences (480-488).\n   - Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so let me check if 484 is within the range. Yes, 484 is page 484, so that's the last 4 in the units place. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, the last block is 400-488, so the tens digit is 4 for 400-449, which is 50 numbers, right? Wait no, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers, then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). So that's 5 blocks of 10 numbers each, totaling 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, but wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, 48 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block is 10 numbers, and how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10). So that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 40 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 480-489 exist? No, because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 includes 480-488, but the tens digit is 8 only up to 488. Wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, I think I missed that earlier. So, total tens place 8's would be 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49 times. Wait, but let me check: from 0-399, it's 4 blocks of 10, so 40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 +49=97. So, 8 appears 97 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this happens 48 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-449), contributing 10 times each, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), with an additional 9 times in 480-488. Totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 (units) + 49 (tens) = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 489th number, which isn't there, the units digit would be 9, so actually, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me think. The first 4 in the units place is at 4, then every 10 pages: 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, from 4 to 484, that's how many numbers? Well, the last one is 484, which is 480 + 4. So, 480 is 48*10, so 48 times. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, so that's 48 times. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but let's check the last one. The last number with 8 in the units place before 488 is 488 itself. So, 488 is included. So, how many numbers? Let's see: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. So, let's check each range: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each and 1 range with 9. So, 4*10 +9=40+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484.

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many times does this happen? Well, from 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, each set contributes one 4 in the units place. However, the last set might not complete, so I need to check if 488 is included. The last 4 in the units place before 488 is 484, which is within 488. So, actually, it's 48 times. Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10, so the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, when we divide 488 by 10, we get 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such sets are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. But wait, in the last hundred, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 40 = 88, plus 89 is 177. So, there are 177 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? It's floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, let's check the last number. 488 ends with 8, so that's included. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. How many such sets? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. But wait, in the last hundred, 480-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, that's not 10. So, actually, in the hundreds place, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. For the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last hundred if it doesn't complete. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4\u00d710=40, but now I'm adding 9, so total 49. Hmm, that makes sense because the last set doesn't complete a full 10. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48 units, 49 tens, so 97 total. But wait, let me double-check the tens place. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets \u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 40 +9=49. So, total 8's: 48 +49=97. Now, the number of 4's is 177, and 8's is 97. So, the difference is 177 -97=80. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For 4's: units=48, tens=40, hundreds=89. Total=177. For 8's: units=48, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=97. 177-97=80. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And for 8's, the hundreds place is 0, which is correct because 800-899 isn't in the book. So, yes, the difference is 80. But wait, I think I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me recount. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's every 100 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49. So, units place 8's:48, tens place:49, total 97. So, 177-97=80. So, the answer should be 80 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the units place for 4's, I did floor(488/10)=48, but actually, the number of 4's in the units place is how many times 4 appears in the ones place. So, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, total number is floor(488/10)=48, but wait, 488/10=48.8, so the integer part is 48, but actually, the 48th set ends at 480, and then from 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once more at 484. Wait, so actually, it's 48 +1=49? No, wait, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, and then in the incomplete set from 481-488, 484 is included, so that's one more. So, units place 4's:48+1=49. Wait, that changes things. So, earlier, I thought units place 4's were 48, but actually, it's 49. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, from 1-488, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then 488 is included, which is another 8. So, units place 8's:48+1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought units place 8's were 48. So, I think I made a mistake there. Let me correct that. For units place 4's: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is the last page, and 488 is included, which has a units digit of 8, but 484 is included, which is 48\u00d710 +4=484. So, the units digit 4 appears 48 times in the first 480 pages, and then once more at 484, making it 49. So, units place 4's:49. Similarly, units place 8's: floor(488/10)=48, but 488 is included, so units digit 8 appears 48 times in the first 480 pages (8,18,...,478), and then once more at 488, making it 49. So, units place 8's:49. Now, let's recount the 4's: units=49, tens=40, hundreds=89. Total=49+40=89+89=178. Wait, no: 49+40=89, plus 89=178. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=49+49=98. So, the difference is 178-98=80. Wait, same as before. So, no, the difference remains 80. So, my initial calculation was correct, but I had a confusion in the units place, but it turned out that both 4's and 8's had one extra in the units place, so the difference remained the same. So, the final answer is 80 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this happens 48 times in full decades (1-480) plus once at 484, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149).

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many such sets are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does the 48th set end at 480? Let me check: 480 is the end of the 48th set, so the next set would be 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 481-488. So, in the units place, the 48th set would have a 4 in 484. So, actually, there are 48 times where the units digit is 4. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: The first block is 40-49 (that's 10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is the sum of the units, tens, and hundreds places: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. Wait, let me double-check that. 48 + 50 is 98, and 98 + 89 is 187. Okay, so 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets. But wait, the last set is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, in each set of 10, there's exactly one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit being 8. This happens in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this block. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 (1 block), 180-189 (2nd), 280-289 (3rd), 380-389 (4th), and 480-488 (5th, but only 9 numbers here: 480-488). Wait, no, from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but in terms of the tens place, it's still 8 in the tens digit for each of those. So, each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except possibly the last one. Let me think: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks contribute 4\u00d710=40, and the last block contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but is 480-488 actually 9 numbers? Let's count: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so yes, the tens digit is 8 for each of these 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit being 8. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97. Wait, 48+49 is 97. So, 97 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the 4's again: Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each block is 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. Total 4's: 48+50+89=187. That seems correct. Now for the 8's: Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So total 8's: 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, so the answer would be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. When I count 80-89, that's 10 numbers, correct. Similarly, 180-189, etc., each 10. But 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place there. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 +9=49. That seems right. So, yes, the difference is 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from page 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **97**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find the total number, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so again, 48 times. The last 8 in the units place is at 488, which is the 48th occurrence. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, let me check: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many blocks of 10 are there? From 0-399, there are 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total for tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97. So, there are 97 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, it's every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first number is 4, and the last is 484. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Here, a_n = 484, a_1 = 4, d = 10. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4 from both sides: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is included, but 540-549 isn't. Let's count each set: - 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times. - 140-149: Another 10. - 240-249: Another 10. - 340-349: Another 10. - 440-449: Another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers. Then each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) will have a 40-49 block. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-449 and 450-488. So, the 40-49 in 400-488 is 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each gives 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. So, 50 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, looking at the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence formula: a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Subtract 8: 10(n-1) = 480. Divide by 10: n-1 = 48. So, n = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, since the book goes up to 488, 480-489 would be another set, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: Now, how many numbers here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four sets gives 10 8's in the tens place, and the last set gives 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 48 full groups and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page. So, does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 488, which is 4 in the hundreds, 8 in the tens, and 8 in the units. So, the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, from 4 to 484, that's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 40-49), 1 (140-149), 2 (240-249), 3 (340-349), and 4 (440-449). So that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, the tens place has 50 occurrences of 4. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many full ranges there are: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is included). So, total in tens place: 4 full ranges (each 10) and one partial range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So yes, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4 to 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (including 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Well, from 0-488, we have the blocks starting at 0, 100, 200, 300, and 400. So, that's 5 blocks. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's valid. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check the last block: 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187? Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units: 48, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is indeed 187. Hmm, but let me think: from 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so that's correct. The tens digit is 4 in each block of 100, so 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only part of the fifth block. So, in the tens place, each full block of 100 has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the fifth block, 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50, which matches what I had before. So, units:48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's: 48+50=98 +89=187. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included, so 8 appears in 8,18,...,488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence? Wait, wait, no. Because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers? Wait, let's check: from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8? So, 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 10n - 2. So, 10n -2 \u2264488 \u219210n \u2264490 \u2192n\u226449. So, n=49. So, 49 times. Wait, but earlier for 4's in units place, I had 48. So, is it 49 for 8's? Let me confirm: 488 \u00f710=48.8, so the last term is 488, which is 10*49 -2=488. So, yes, 49 times. So, units place:49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many full blocks? Let's see: from 0-488, the blocks are 0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488. So, in each block except the last, the 8 in the tens place occurs 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in the first four blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Now, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's:40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Wait, that's 98. Wait, but let me check again: units place 49, tens place 49, so total 98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one number ending with 4. So, how many such sets are there? Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then a partial set from 481 to 488. So, 48 full sets give 48 fours in the units place. Now, the partial set: 481-488. Does this include a 4 in the units place? Let's see: 484 is within this range, so that's another 4. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, so 48 sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48, plus 484 which is the 49th occurrence. So, yes, 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 isn't. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49: that's one block. Then 140-149: another. 240-249: another. 340-349: another. 440-449: another. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but let me check: 440-449 is within 1-488, yes. So that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many fours in the hundreds place? It's 89 fours. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think: from 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, the count is indeed 89. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. Plus, the partial set from 481-488: 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is included. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89: 1 block. 180-189: another. 280-289: another. 380-389: another. 480-488: that's another partial block. So, that's 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488). Each full block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, but the last block contributes 9 eights. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each contribute 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 eights. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the block 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: number of 4's (188) minus number of 8's (98) = 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Number of 4's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (48 full sets of 10 plus 484).\n2. **Tens Place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the Number of 8's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (48 full sets of 10 plus 488).\n2. **Tens Place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** No 8's appear here since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
