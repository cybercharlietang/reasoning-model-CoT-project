Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting ranges, especially in the hundreds place, maybe I missed something. Let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That seems right. And for the 8's, in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, yes, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers (4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Correct. - Tens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds place:0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the tens and hundreds places, I might have missed something. Let me check the tens place for 8's again. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. For the 4's, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. So, I think my calculation is right. Therefore, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

Wait, but let me think again: when counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that part is correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
