    "text": " Wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50=99, plus 89=188. That's correct. For 8's: - Units:49, correct. - Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check if I included all the 4's correctly. For the hundreds place, 400-488: 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, each hundred has a 40-49, so 4 sets before 400, and then 440-449, which is another 10. So, 5 sets, 50 fours. Correct. Units place: 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th number, so 49 fours. Correct. For 8's: Units:49, correct. Tens: Each hundred has 80-89, which is 10, but in the 400s, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me check if I missed any 4's or 8's. Let me think about the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is the 49th number because 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 => n= (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For the tens place, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers. Correct. So, 188 fours. For 8's: Units:49, correct. Tens:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 49. Correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the hundreds place? For 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For 8's, the hundreds place doesn't come into play because the book ends at 488, so no page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0. So, 98 eights in total. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula or a different counting method to confirm. Alternatively, I could calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For a number from 1 to n, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is floor((n + 1)/10) + something? Wait, perhaps a better way is to use the formula for digit counting. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to n is (n // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >= d, else (n // 10). Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, for each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. Let me try that for 4's again. Units place: For each complete set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, up to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 //10 =48 sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. But since 488 is the last number, and 488 has 8 in units place, but 484 is the last 4 in units place. Wait, 488 is 48*10 +8, so the 48th set ends at 480, and then 481-488. So, in the units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 times, but since 484 is within 480-489, that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for 8's in units place: up to 488, how many times does 8 appear? 488//10=48, so 48 times, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights. Tens place: For 4's, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). So, how many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers. So, in the tens place, for each hundred, 10 times. So, 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488: how many? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Similarly, for 8's in tens place: 0-99:80-89 (10), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), 400-488:480-488 (9). So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, 50 fours in tens place, 49 eights. Hundreds place: For 4's, 400-488:89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. For 8's, no numbers, as before. So, hundreds place:89 fours, 0 eights. So, adding up: fours:49+50+89=188, eights:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. 488 -400 +1 =89. So, 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now, the 8's: - Units place:8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1=49. Correct. - Tens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the hundreds place for 4's, we have 89, which is a lot, but for 8's, we have none in hundreds place. So, that makes sense. Let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula or digit-by-digit analysis. Alternatively, for each digit position, calculate the number of 4's and 8's. Let me try that again for confirmation. **For 4's:**\n\n- **Units place:** Numbers from 1 to 488. For each block of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, total blocks = 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial block (481-488), the 4 is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\n- **Tens place:** For each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100 numbers, there's a sequence where the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). Since 488 is less than 500, we have four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Each full hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 within this range, but actually, 401-488 includes 40-49 in the tens place? Wait, no. Wait, 401-488: the tens digit cycles from 0-9 in each hundred. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in the 400s, which is 40-49, but 401-488 includes 401-410, 411-420, etc. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, up to 488, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as calculated before. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\n**For 8's:**\n\n- **Units place:** Same logic as 4's, but 8's occur at 8,18,28,...,488. So, 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1=49.\n\n- **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** As before, there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8 in 1-488.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
