    "text": " 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For the 8's: - Units place:8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1=49. Correct. - Tens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. Let me just think if there's any overlap or if I double-counted something. For example, when counting both units and tens, does a number like 444 get counted in both units and tens? Yes, it does. But that's okay because we're counting the number of digits, not the number of numbers. So, 444 has two 4's, so it contributes to both units and tens place counts. So, I think the method is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Number of 4's = \u230a484 / 10\u230b + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   Number of 4's = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   Number of 4's = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Number of 8's = \u230a488 / 10\u230b + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.  \n   Number of 8's = 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Number of 8's = 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.**\n\n**Difference: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.**\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's 488 -400 +1 =89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For the 8's: - Units:49, correct. - Tens:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 8's, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's correct. So, total eights are 98, fours are 188, so the difference is 90. Hmm, that seems right. But let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula or a different counting method. Alternatively, for each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Let me try that approach for units, tens, and hundreds. For units digit: For any digit position, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated using a formula, but since N is 488, maybe it's easier to count manually as I did before. Alternatively, for units digit: For each complete set of 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but wait, 488 is less than 490, so it's 48 full decades (1-480) and then 481-488. So, for units digit: 48 full decades mean each digit 0-9 appears 48 times. But wait, no, because each decade has 10 numbers, so each digit appears once per decade. So, for units digit, the number of times 4 appears is 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (484), so 49. Similarly, for 8, it's 48 times (from 1-480) plus 1 (488), so 49. Wait, but in 481-488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once, making it 49. So, units digit: 49 fours, 49 eights. Then, tens digit: For tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, from 1-400, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place? From 1-400, there are 400 numbers, which is 4 sets of 100. In each set, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4, in each 100 numbers, 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 sets: 4*10=40 fours. Similarly, for 8: 4*10=40 eights. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, in 400-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place? For 400-409: tens digit is 0. 410-419:1. 420-429:2. 430-439:3. 440-449:4. 450-459:5. 460-469:6. 470-479:7. 480-488:8. So, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place from 400-488. Similarly, 4 appears in the tens place in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total for tens digit: fours = 40 (from 1-400) +10 (440-449) =50. Eights =40 (from 1-400) +9 (480-488)=49. So, total tens digits: fours=50, eights=49. For hundreds digit: From 1-399, hundreds digit is 1,2,3. From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4. So, 4 appears 89 times (400-488). 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds digits: fours=89, eights=0. Now, adding up all digits: Fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) =188. Eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place up to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " That's 488 -400 +1 =89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. Now, the 8's: - Units:8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. - Tens:80-89 (10),180-189(10),280-289(10),380-389(10),480-488(9). 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for 8's would be zero, which it is, so that's correct. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For 4's: units, tens, hundreds. Similarly for 8's. Alternatively, maybe using a formula. For a digit d in position p (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated based on higher digits, current digit, and lower digits. But since 488 is not a very high number, maybe it's easier to count manually as I did before. Alternatively, for each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. Let me try this method for 4's again. **Units place for 4's:** The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor((N + 1)/10). So, for N=488, it's floor(489/10)=48. But wait, that would be 48, but earlier I counted 49. Hmm, maybe the formula is a bit different. Let me think: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete cycles are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But then, in the incomplete cycle (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once more at 484. So total units place 4's: 48*1 +1=49. That matches my earlier count. Similarly, for tens place: the number of times 4 appears in the tens place can be calculated as follows. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, 10 times 4 in the tens place. For example, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, etc. Now, how many hundreds are there? Up to 488, so 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 488 is in the 400-499 range, but we only go up to 488. So, for each hundred except the last one, we have 10 occurrences. The last hundred (400-488) has how many? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus the 10 from 440-449, totaling 50. That's correct. Now, hundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as calculated before. So, 89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place. Using the same formula, floor((488 +1)/10)=48.8, so 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the incomplete cycle (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more at 488. So, units place 8's:48 +1=49. Tens place: For each hundred, 10 times 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. Hundreds place: 800-899, but we only go up to 488, so 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the hundreds place? For 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. For 8's, there are no hundreds digits of 8, so that's zero. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me think again. When counting the tens place for 4's, I included 440-449, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 10 numbers. Similarly, for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is the last page. So, I think my counts are accurate. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.

Because 488 is included in both units and tens place counts. But in the units place, 488 is counted as an 8 in the units. In the tens place, it's counted as an 8 in the tens.
