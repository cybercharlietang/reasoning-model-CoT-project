    "text": " Wait, the first page is 1, so the hundreds digit can be 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks are within 488. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, so 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because when I counted the tens place for 4's, I had 50, and for 8's, I had 49 in tens. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check again. For fours in the tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 full sets of 10, and one set of 9, which is 49. So, that's correct. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place (pages go up to 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, right? So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Hmm, let me check again. Wait, 49 + 50 is indeed 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many times this happens. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 49 numbers where the units digit is 8. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 and +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400+1=89. Yes, that's correct. And in the tens place for fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place for fours, 49. So, 188 fours. For eights, units=49, tens=49, so 98 eights. So, the difference is 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all numbers from 400 to 488, right? So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484: that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10): that's 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So 49+50=99, plus 89=188 fours. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, considering units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers are there? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. And for the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full decades, but the last one is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49. Let me check units:8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98.

    "text": " Let me think. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: starting at 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 9 numbers in the 480-488 range. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so does that affect the count? Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the 480-488 is the fifth block, but it's only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't count any extra numbers. For example, in the tens place for fours, I counted 5 sets of 10, which is 50, but let me check: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). Yes, that's 5 sets, so 50. For eights in the tens place, I had 4 full sets (80-89, etc.) and 480-488, which is 9, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. Units place for both fours and eights: 49 each. So, I think the calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's see, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers where 8 is in the units place. So, 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the last set. Let's count how many sets: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total 8's are 49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.

Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial set of 9 in 480-488. So, that's 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49.

The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. There are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So total 49+50+89=188. Correct. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...488. Let's see, 488 is included. How many? The last number is 488, which is 48*10 +8. So, starting from 8 (which is 0*10 +8), up to 48*10 +8=488. So, 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So total 49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 8's, in 480-488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's correct.

Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are.

So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So, total in tens place is 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Let me think. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 page numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, I can do 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many. Each full set (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. There are four full sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, the next set is 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers here. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, 400-488 includes the hundreds digit as 4, but the page numbers go up to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400 is included, so from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Let me check: 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each contribute 10 eights, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right.

    "text": " Wait, no, 400-488 is actually 489 pages, but the book is 488 pages, so the last page is 488. So, pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake. Wait, when counting the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. So total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488. Let me count how many sets. Each hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's to make sure. **Counting 4's again:**\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 40-49 (10),140-149(10),240-249(10),340-349(10),440-449(10). That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Correct.\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n**Counting 8's again:**\n- Units place:8,18,28,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10.

Correct.\n- Hundreds place: none, as before. So total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours.

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers). So, let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, so how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, so 49 numbers? Wait, but 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Let's calculate: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets. Each set is 10 numbers, except the last one which might be fewer. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let me check: 400 is the first, then 401, ..., up to 488. So, yes, 89 numbers. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Hmm, wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 8 numbers where the 49th 4 is at 484. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: In each hundred, there are 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? There are 4 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, that's 5 sets, but the last set is only up to 488. So, in the first four sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in each hundred. Wait, no, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, but when it's 4, that's 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 480-488. So, how many times does the tens digit equal 4 in 400-488? Let's see: 400-409: tens digit is 0, so no. Wait, no, wait: the tens digit is the second digit. So, in 400-409, the tens digit is 0. In 410-419, it's 1, etc., up to 440-449, where the tens digit is 4. Then 450-459:5, 460-469:6, 470-479:7, 480-488:8. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only once, from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488). So, in the tens place, from 400-488, it's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, total tens place fours: 4 sets of 10 (from 40-49 in each hundred up to 300-399) plus 10 from 440-449, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then an extra 8 at 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many times that happens. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's 49 occurrences, right? Let me check: 8,18,...,488. So, from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. How many sets of 10 are there where the tens digit is 8? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but the last partial ten has 8 numbers (481-488). So, does that mean 48 fours in the units place? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, the units digit 4 occurs at 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there? Let me see: starting at 4, each step of 10. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488.

Tens place: as before, 10 per hundred, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so does the tens digit 4 occur in 10 numbers there? Let's see: 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 5 sets \u00d710=50. So, that's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So total 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place except the last one, which has 9. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.

Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences. There are 5 such blocks, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last block (480-488) has 9 numbers, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, actually, 400-488 is a span of 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many 4's is that? 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me count how many such numbers there are. Starting from 8, each step of 10: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms can be found by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. For 8's, in the tens place, I counted 49, but let me check again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

This totals 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, because the book has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 49 + 50 is indeed 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 484 / 10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers)\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Units place: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, how many more 4's than 8's? 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. The formula is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 4 full hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10*4=40 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, the hundreds digit is 0 because 800 is beyond 488. So, yes, 0.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the units place for 4's, I included 484, which is correct. For 8's, I included 488 in the units place, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 480 is the first, 488 is the last, so 488 -480 +1=9. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 49 eights in tens place.\n\nSo, the total is 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred:\n     - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Number of 4's: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred:\n     - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Number of 8's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 (for 480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is included. So, how many 8's in the units place? From 8 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8. So, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's 49 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, then 481, up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me check the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Wait, but earlier I thought 488 is included in the units place, so units place has 49 eights, and tens place has 49 eights, so total 98 eights. Now, comparing fours and eights: fours are 188, eights are 98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nWait, for the fours in the units place, I thought 484 is the last one, which is 484, so that's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place for fours, it's 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 blocks of 10, so 50 fours. That's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, so 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10, and the last block (480-488) has 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8, so no 8's there.

So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89.

Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).

So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each contribute 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which suggests 49 occurrences, similar to the 4's. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. Yes, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, is that right? Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place for 8 would be 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but let me double-check. Each hundred block except the last one contributes 10 eights in the tens place. The last hundred is 400-499, but we only go up to 488, so in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488/10=48.8, so 49 times. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's=49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, the total number of 4's is the sum of units, tens, and hundreds place counts: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, that's another 10 numbers (480-489, but only up to 488, which is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, actually, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, I need to adjust. So, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4 +9=49.

Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 8's: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 4 full sets (each 10) and one partial set (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so none. Correct.\n\nSo, the total counts are correct: 188 fours and 98 eights.

    "text": " Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me confirm: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check that: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).

Wait, no, 400-499 would have 100 numbers with hundreds digit 4, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 89 numbers. So, how many 4's in the hundreds place? Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is.

Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., and in 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences for the first four blocks, and 9 for the last part (480-488).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many times that is. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? If I take 488 divided by 10, that's 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the 8th number in the first set (1-10), and then every 10 after that. So, 488 is the 49th 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds =49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   - From 4 to 484:  \n     \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Total blocks contributing to tens place: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Total occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.  \n   - Total numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\) times.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n\\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\) times.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   - From 8 to 488:  \n     \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - However, the last block (480-488) only contributes 9 occurrences.  \n   - Total blocks contributing to tens place: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block (480-488).  \n   - Total occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n\\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\) times.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, no, 400-488 is correct because 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many times this happens. The first 8 is at 8, the next at 18, and so on. The last occurrence in the units place would be 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let me calculate how many terms that is. The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have to check if 480-488 are included. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks we have. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10). From 201-300: 280-289 (10). From 301-400: 380-389 (10). From 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, total eights in the tens place: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can only be 8 if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Hmm, so the answer is 99 more fours than eights. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again.
