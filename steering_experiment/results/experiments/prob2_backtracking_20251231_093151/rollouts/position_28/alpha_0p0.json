    "text": " How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89= 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which gives 48 eights. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 8,18,28,...,488. Yes, because 488 is 48*10 + 8, which is the 49th term. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + 10(n-1) = 484. 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 numbers with 4 in tens. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms. The first term is 8, and the last term is 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488. 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many tens place eights? Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one. So, from 1-400: 4 blocks, each with 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. From 1-400, each hundred block has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total 49. That seems correct. And units place is 49, so total eights 98. Fours are 188, so 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 4 and common difference 10. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. Solving for n gives n = 49. So, 49 fours in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. This is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has the first term 8 and common difference 10. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n gives n = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers (480-488). Total eights in tens place = 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers between 800-899, so no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal eights = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** Number of fours (188) minus number of eights (98) equals 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. But wait, does each of those numbers have a 4 in the hundreds place? Yes, because 400 is 4 in the hundreds, 401 is 4, etc., up to 488. So that's correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. Units place also had 49. So, 98 eights. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I feel like that might be too high. Let me check again. Maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is indeed 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. Hmm, maybe I should check the tens place for fours. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Correct. Units place:4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th number, so 49 fours. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units:8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th, so 49 eights. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But let me think again: is there a way to cross-verify this? Maybe by considering that in each digit position, the count of 4's and 8's might be similar, but in the hundreds place, fours have an extra 89, while eights have none. So, that would make sense that fours are more. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of digits and see if the counts make sense, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can write out the counts for a smaller number and see if my method works. For example, let's say a 20-page book. How many fours and eights? Page numbers 1-20. Fours: 4,14: so 2 fours. Eights:8,18:2 eights. So, difference is 0. Using my method: units place:2 fours, 2 eights. Tens place: 0 fours, 10-19: no fours in tens, but 8 in tens at 8-9? Wait, no, 8 is in units. Wait, in 8-9, the tens digit is 0, but in 80-89, but in 1-20, the tens digit is 1 for 10-19, 0 for 1-9. So, in 1-20, tens digit for fours is 0, and for eights is 0. So, units:2 fours, 2 eights. So, total fours=2, eights=2. Difference=0. So, my method works here. Let me try another example: 50 pages. Fours: units:5 (4,14,24,34,44), tens:5 (40-49), hundreds:0. So, total fours=10. Eights: units:5 (8,18,28,38,48), tens:5 (40-49? No, 40-49 is fours. For eights in tens, it's 80-89, but 50 pages only go up to 50, so no eights in tens place. So, eights=5. So, difference=10-5=5. Using my method: units fours=5, tens fours=5 (40-49), hundreds=0. So, 10 fours. Units eights=5, tens=0, hundreds=0. So, 5 eights. Difference=5. Correct. So, my method works here too. So, going back to the original problem, I think my calculation is correct, and the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences for the first four blocks and 9 for the last.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, when counting the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing a 4, so 48 fours, plus the 484, which is the 49th. So, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and there are 4 hundreds (1-400, 401-800, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so actually, the hundreds are 1-400, 401-488. Wait, no, hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, from 1-99: tens digit 4 is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149: 10. 200-299: 240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 450-488 doesn't have 4 in the tens place. Wait, no, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, plus the 488, which is the 49th. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so let's check. Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last one, which might be cut short. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place eights: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 =49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) =98. Now, subtracting the number of eights from fours: 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check the counts because 90 seems a bit high. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count each block. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.

Hmm, but let me check if I'm counting correctly. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. So total fours are 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, the book goes up to 488, so 480-489 would be next, but since it's 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place is only up to 488. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's see: From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them except 488? Wait, no, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place for 480-488. Wait, but earlier, each block of 100 had 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one. So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the number of 4's. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now for 8's: Units place: from 8,18,...,488. That's (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, and the last set is 9 numbers (480-488). So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So total eights:49+49=98. So difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, there might be overlaps or something I'm missing. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For the units place: For any digit d (except maybe 0), the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor((N + 1)/10). Wait, but in our case, N is 488. So for 4 in units place: floor((488 +1)/10)=floor(489/10)=48. But earlier I got 49. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe the formula is different. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 48*10 +4=484. So the count is 48 +1=49. So the formula might be (N // 10) +1 if the last digit is >=4. Wait, maybe the formula is more complex. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count manually as I did before. So I think my initial count of 49 fours in the units place is correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. The last one is 488, which is 48*10 +8=488. So that's 48 +1=49 eights. So that's correct. Now, for the tens place: For each digit d, the number of times it appears in the tens place from 1 to N can be calculated by considering each hundred block. For example, for 4 in the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So from 1-100, 40-49:10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200:140-149:10, and so on. Since 488 is less than 500, the hundreds blocks are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. So for 4 in the tens place, each block contributes 10, except maybe the last one. Wait, in 401-488, the tens digit can be 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place fours: 5 blocks *10=50. Correct. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place: each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block if N is less than the next hundred. So from 1-100:80-89:10, 101-200:180-189:10, 201-300:280-289:10, 301-400:380-389:10, 401-488:480-488:9. So total tens place eights:10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Now, for the hundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit can't be 8. So, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Total eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. So the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought maybe 90, but I'm trying to see if I made any mistake. Let me try another way: perhaps write a small table for each position.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n- For 4: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 mod 10 >=4, we add 1, so 49.\n- For 8: same, floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod10=8>=8, so 49.\n\nFor tens place:\n- For 4: each hundred has 10, and there are 4 full hundreds (1-400), plus in 401-488, 440-449 is another 10, so 5*10=50.\n- For 8: each hundred has 10, but in the last hundred (401-488), only 480-488 is 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n- For 4: 400-488 is 89 numbers.\n- For 8: 0.\n\nSo total fours:49+50+89=188.\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let's go through each place again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is within the page numbers. So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see, the first is 8, and the last is 488.

So, that's 10 +10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so does that affect the count? Let me think again. Each hundred block contributes a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens:49, so total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the tens place for 8. Let me recount the eights in the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, I had 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For fours in the hundreds place, 400-488:89 numbers, correct. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 90, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 8. Let me think: the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 49. That seems right. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many tens places have 8. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Wait, 480 is 4-8-0, so tens digit is 8, same for 481, etc., up to 488. So that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus the 9 from 480-488, so 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the total eights from the total fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units place? The formula is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last digit is >=4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But since 488 has 8 in the units place, which is less than 4? Wait, no, 488 is 488, so the last number with 4 in units place is 484, which is 48*10 +4, so 48 times? Wait, no, 48*10 +4 is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4 as the first. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So total 49+50+89=188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, the first four blocks have 10 each, and the last block has 9. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights=90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98=90. But let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place for fours: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. For eights, the tens place: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, 480-488: 9 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. Units place for eights: 8,18,...,488. How many? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in units place. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, fours:188, eights:98, difference:90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 fours. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place:50 fours. 49+50+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, 400-488: the tens digit can't be 8 because 480-489 would be beyond 488. Wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last one). So, in the hundreds place 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) plus 9 from 400-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.

Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 8 appears in the units place at 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be another block, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 484 is included, it's 49 times. So units:49. Tens: each hundred has 10, so 40-49,140-149, etc. There are 5 sets (40s, 140s, 240s, 340s, 440s). Each set contributes 10, so 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours:49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last one is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. So units:49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. Each set (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 numbers. How many such sets are there? From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 once, except maybe the last partial hundred. Wait, actually, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets (80s, 180s, 280s, 380s), each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, and 488 is the last, so that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's:4\u00d710=40 plus 9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, units:49, tens:49, so total 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, how many more 4's than 8's? 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, how many? Let me think: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last).

So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188 and eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I missed something. Let me check the tens place for eights again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems right. And units place: 49. So, 98 total eights. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems correct.

Let's go through each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10 because 489 is beyond 488).

So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, there are four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. That's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488/10=48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets of 10 are there? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, the tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So total tens place eights: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10=40 +9=49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that's a big difference. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, the hundreds place for fours is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. That's correct because 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. For eights, in the hundreds place, there are none, so 0. So, fours total: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Eights total:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for eights would have some, but since the book ends at 488, 800 isn't reached, so no eights in hundreds place. So, yeah, the difference is 90.

    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8, so let me count each block. Each block from x80 to x89 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but let's check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many full blocks we have: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90.

So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence.

Now, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.

Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no: 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49th occurrence.

So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, plus 89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct. I think I did this right.

Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? From 8, 18, ..., 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one. Wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*49=482? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 48, plus 1 if the last page is beyond the next multiple. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the 49th group, the last number is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check that again. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me double-check. Wait, in the units place, I thought it was 49 eights. But wait, from 8 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? Let's think differently. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then in the 49th decade, from 480-488, there's another 8 at 488. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place:49. Tens place: as above, 49. So, total eights:49+49=98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours. Units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for fours. Let me check that again. For the tens place, fours appear in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. That's correct. And in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total. Wait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 and 9, total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98 eights in total. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98. Let me check again: units: 49, tens:49, so 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times? The formula is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 >= 4. Wait, 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But since 488 has 8 in the units place, which is greater than 4, so we add 1, making it 49. So that's correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and there are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 in each hundred. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That's correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many sets? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. In the tens place, each hundred block (except the last one) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 0-99: 80-89 (10), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10). That's 4 sets of 10, which is 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, total eights: 98. Fours:188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct. But let me check another way.

Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that set. So, each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, for the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total eights in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98 = 90.

    "text": " So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, considering units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each and 1 block with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. Hmm, but let me double-check the tens place. For 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, which is 488. To find how many times 8 appears in the units place, I can do (488 // 10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is 8.

So, the tens place has 4 sets of 10 (40 numbers) plus 9 numbers in 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me go through the fours again: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. Units place: 8,18,...,488: 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. So, 98 eights. Fours: 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. So, I think my calculation is right.

Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Let me confirm: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers, so 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block is 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks are there up to 488. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Wait, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, the tens place 8 in 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 numbers in 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that seems off because earlier I thought the tens place would have 49, but let me double-check. Wait, when I counted the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the first four are full 10s, and the last is 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. So total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Wait, but earlier I thought 49 units and 49 tens, so 98 eights. But when I was counting fours, I had 188 fours. So, the difference would be 188 -98=90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the eights in the tens place. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 in tens place. Units place: 49, so total 98 eights. Now, fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. So 49+50=99, +89=188. So, 188 fours, 98 eights. Difference is 188-98=90.
