    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, which would give 48 eights, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, since the book ends at 488, 480-489 would be beyond 488, so we only go up to 488. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. But wait, 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but the tens digit here is 8, right? Wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, but the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place, we have 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but the tens digit is 8, so yes, it's included. So, total tens place 8's: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counts.\n\nStarting with the fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = floor(484/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, except maybe the last one if it's cut off. But 440-449 is within 488, so 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nNow for the eights:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, which would be 48*10=480, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in units place. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 800-899, but the book ends at 488, so 0. Correct.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal '4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of '8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is '8' since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal '8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, each block except the last has 10 numbers. Let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That's correct. And for eights, the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last block has only 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9: 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in tens place. Units place: 49 eights. So, total eights: 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488.

Let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: This is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488).

So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) has 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the Number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would give 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 480-488. Let me break this down: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 eights. - 480-488: Here, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit is 8, so numbers from 480 to 488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens place in the 400s contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, it's 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that correct? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9 =49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we'll count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. \n   - This is 49 times (from 4 to 484 in steps of 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is 49 times (from 8 to 488 in steps of 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which would mean 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 times because 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the 49th 4 is at 484. So units place is 49, that's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so from 1-400, that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40, but wait, 400 is included, so actually, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 +89=188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nAgain, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Each full hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So total is 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188. That's correct.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? For fours, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nFor eights, hundreds place is 0, correct.\n\nUnits and tens for fours and eights seem correctly counted.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each set contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, so 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, but I'm only counting the hundreds place. So, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, so how many 8's in the units place? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's the 48th set plus the 8 in 488. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, the tens place 8's are: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. I said that from 80-89, that's 10, same for 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and then 480-488, which is 9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total eights are 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place for 8's was 49, and tens place 49, so total 98. But let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 appears in 488 as the units digit. So, that's 49 eights in the units place. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the tens place, 480-488 gives 9 eights, so 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49. So, units place is 49, tens is 49, total 98 eights.\n\nNow, total fours are 188, eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the fours count because that seems high. Let me recount the fours.\n\n1. **Units place:** From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? Let's see: The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Numbers where tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 5 blocks of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, eights: units place 49, tens place 49, total 98.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for eights again. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, no page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights there.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the tens and hundreds places, I might have made a mistake. Let me try another approach, perhaps using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a three-digit number ABC, where A is the hundreds digit, B is the tens, and C is the units.\n\nThe total number of pages is 488, so we can consider numbers from 001 to 488, padding with leading zeros to make them three digits. This way, each number is three digits, and we can analyze each digit position.\n\nBut maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, I can use the concept of digit frequencies.\n\nFor units digit: In any range, each digit 0-9 appears equally often in the units place, except possibly the last partial set.\n\nSimilarly for tens and hundreds.\n\nBut let's try to compute it more systematically.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: floor(488/10)=48 full groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) will have one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488). So, units digit: 4 appears 48+1=49 times, 8 appears 48+1=49 times.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nIn the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSo, for the first 400 pages (4 hundreds), the tens digit 4 appears 4*10=40 times, and 8 appears 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-488).\n\nSo, for the tens digit 4: numbers 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit 8: numbers 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 40 (from full hundreds) +10 (from 401-488) =50.\n\nTotal tens digit 8's: 40 (from full hundreds) +9 (from 401-488)=49.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:50, 8's:49.\n\nNow, hundreds digit:\n\nFor 488 pages, the hundreds digit is 4 only in pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nNow, summing up:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:50\n\n- Hundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:49\n\n- Hundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems consistent with my earlier calculation. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one 4. From 4, 14, ..., 484, there are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** In each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contribute 10 occurrences. There are 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which only goes up to 488. Let's check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because when I count the eights in the tens place, I thought it was 49, but let me double-check. Wait, when counting the tens place for eights, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, that's correct. Units place for eights: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0, total eights:98. For fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total:188. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but when I first thought about units place for fours, I thought it was 49, but let me confirm: from 4,14,...,484. How many numbers is that? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. So, (484)/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for tens place in fours: 40-49,140-149, etc., each block of 100 has 10 fours in the tens place. There are 5 such blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. For hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: same as fours, 49. Tens place: 49 as above. Hundreds place:0. So, total eights:98. So, 188-98=90.

Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. Let me calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. The last number with 8 in units place is 488, which is 8 in the units. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\nTherefore, there are \\boxed{90} more 4's printed than 8's."

Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers.

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits with 8.

The last number is 484. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So that's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 4 hundreds (1-400, 401-800, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so actually, the hundreds place is only 400-488. Wait, no, the tens place is about the second digit, so 40-49 in each hundred. So, in 1-100: 40-49:10. 101-200:140-149:10. 201-300:240-249:10. 301-400:340-349:10. 401-488:440-449:10.

Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The last number is 488, so (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49.

So, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, and number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 49 numbers, right? Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the book since it goes up to 488. So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 488 is included, so that's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, adding up: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence.

So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.

So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488.

Now, to find how many more fours than eights, subtract the total eights from total fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but let me double-check my counts.

Let me check the tens place for fours again. When counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five sets, but the last one only has 9 numbers, so 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That's correct. Units place for both fours and eights: 49 each. So, the calculation seems right.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours in total. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 four, so 48 fours, plus the 484, which is the 49th. So units place: 49 fours. Tens place: in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each hundred, 10 numbers have 4 in the tens place. From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is part of the hundreds place. So, in each full hundred, like 1-100, 101-200, etc., there are 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours. But wait, from 1-400, that's 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so in 401-488, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? That would be 40-49 in each hundred, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit in the 400s is 0-8. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. So that's another 10 fours. So total tens place fours: 40 (from 1-400) +10 (from 400-488) =50. That seems correct. Hundreds place: from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, hundreds place:89 fours. So total fours:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, giving 48 eights, plus the 488, which is the 49th. So units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens digit occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many. Each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights:40 (from 1-400) +9 (from 401-488)=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but wait: from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but the last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for eights. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 10*4 +9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total fours: 188, total eights:98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That seems right.\n\nAnd for the units place, 4 appears 49 times, and tens place 50 times, so 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the eights, units place 49, tens place 49, so total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again: 188 fours and 98 eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the tens place for fours. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Correct.\n\nAnd units place: 4,14,...484: 484 is 484, so 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nEights: units place, 8,18,...488: 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total fours:188, eights:98. Difference:90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, we need to check how many numbers are in 480-488. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last set which only has 9. So, let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more fours are there than eights. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. Let me count how many sets of 100 have 10 numbers each with tens digit 8. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 numbers in 480-488. So total in tens place is 40+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. But let me check again. Maybe I overcounted in hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. Units place: every 10 numbers, so from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in units? Let's see: 4,14,...,484. The last number is 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5*10=50. So, 50. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is 8*61=488? Wait, 8*61=488? No, 8*60=480, so 488 is 8*61=488, so 61 occurrences? Wait, no, because 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1-488, the units digit 8 appears 488//10=48 full tens, plus one more if 488 is included. 488 is 8*61, so units digit 8 appears 49 times. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 in tens place. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly for the units place. Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But then, the 49th occurrence would be at 484, which is the 484th page. So, that's 49 fours in the units place. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

So, hundreds place:0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0 =98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98 =90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers starting from 4, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10 numbers starting from 8, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), except for the last block which ends at 488, giving 9 occurrences. Total = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49**.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would have the tens digit as 8. Let me count how many such numbers. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, for the tens place, it's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, each hundred block (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, from 0-99: 80-89:10, 100-199:180-189:10, 200-299:280-289:10, 300-399:380-389:10. Now, 400-488: the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in tens place: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the fours:\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct.\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, checking the eights:\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: None, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0. Correct.\nTotal eights: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours. Wait, but I just thought, maybe I overcounted in the hundreds place for fours? Let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nWait another thought: when counting the tens place for fours, I included 440-449, which is correct because 440-449 is within 488. So, that's 10 fours in the tens place for that set.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, I included 480-488, which is correct as it's within 488. So, 9 numbers there.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block contributes 10 numbers except the last, which contributes 9. Total = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488), which include another 4 (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. From 1-400, that's 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 fours. So that's 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. Hundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So total fours: 49 +50 +89= 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8, and then 8 appears again in 488. So, 48 +1=49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights. How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, we have 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the next block would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so from 480-488, the tens digit is 8. That's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the hundreds place. So, how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

The first three sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289) each contribute 10 eights, so that's 3*10=30. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 eights.

Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit in 480-488 is 4, so the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, but let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be another 10, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, so does that mean in the tens place, for the 400s, it's only 9 numbers? Let me think. The hundreds digit is 4, so 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, for the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus the 9 from 480-488. So, total eights in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, subtracting: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. So (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The last number is 488, so (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So that's 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, the tens place 8's in 480-488 would be from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So in the tens place, for 480-488, it's 9 numbers, not 10. So I need to adjust that. So, the first three sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights, that's 4\u00d710=40. The next set would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 sets, but actually, it's 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10, and then 480-488, which is 9. So total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each set contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   \n   Total '4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is '8' since the book ends at 488.\n   \n   Total '8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 exist? Since the book goes up to 488, yes, 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. Units place: 8,18,...,488: from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let's see: 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place is 49. Tens place is 49. So, total eights:98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90.
