So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. And for 8's, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, I might have missed something. Let me think again. For 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? Let's see: The nth term is 10n -6=4? Wait, no, the nth term where the units digit is 4 is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 +10(n-1)=10n -6. So, when does 10n -6 \u2264488? 10n \u2264494, so n \u226449.4, so n=49. So, 49 terms. Correct. Tens place: each hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. From 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place:8,18,...,488. The nth term is 8 +10(n-1)=10n -2. So, 10n -2 \u2264488 \u219210n \u2264490 \u2192n=49. So, 49 terms. Correct. Tens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using digit positions and calculating the number of times each digit appears in each position. For example, for the units digit, the number of times a digit appears is (n / 10) for each digit, but adjusted for the remainder. Similarly for tens and hundreds. Alternatively, using a formula for each digit position. Let me try that approach to confirm. For the units digit: For 488 pages, the number of 4's in the units place is calculated as follows. The number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488 /10=48.8), so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) include another 4 in the units place (484). So, total units 4's:48 +1=49. Correct. Similarly, for the tens digit: Each group of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 488 /100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, that's 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens 4's:4*10 +10=50. Correct. For the hundreds digit: Only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Same as before. Now, for the 8's: Units digit: 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and the remaining 8 pages include another 8 (488). So, 48 +1=49. Correct. Tens digit: Each group of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total tens 8's:4*10 +9=49. Correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, I might have missed something. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position again, but more carefully. Let's start with 4's: Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The first term is 4, which is 4 +10*(n-1) =484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct. Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Correct. Now, 8's: Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. So, the last term is 488, which is 8 +10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 in units place. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0.

    "text": " Maybe I'm overcomplicating, but let me think again. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider each digit position separately for both 4's and 8's.\n\nFor the 4's:\n\n- Units place: Every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is floor(488/10) +1 if the last digit is 4. Since 488/10 is 48.8, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: Every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each 100, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for 400-488, how many hundreds are there? From 0-488, that's 5 full hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since the book stops at 488, it's only 89 numbers. So, in each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-488, how many full hundreds? 0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488. So, 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers with tens digit 4, except the last block, which is only up to 488. Wait, but 400-488 includes the tens digit 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. Wait, no, that's not right. The tens digit is 4 in any number where the second digit is 4, regardless of the hundreds digit. So, in 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199:140-149 (10). 200-299:240-249 (10). 300-399:340-349 (10). 400-488:440-449 (10) because 440-449 is within 400-488. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: As before, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, so number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct.

Totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should think about it differently. Let's consider each digit place separately again. For the 4's: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. So, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For the 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. I think I was just overthinking, but I think the calculation is right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers, such as 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This gives us:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, so:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all page numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. This is:\n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\nAdding these together, the total number of 4's is:\n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\text{ times}\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers, such as 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This gives:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last contributes 9 (since 488 is the last page). Thus:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place for any page number up to 488, so this contributes 0.\n\nAdding these together, the total number of 8's is:\n\\[\n49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\text{ times}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\n\\[\n188 \\text{ (number of 4's)} - 98 \\text{ (number of 8's)} = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"
