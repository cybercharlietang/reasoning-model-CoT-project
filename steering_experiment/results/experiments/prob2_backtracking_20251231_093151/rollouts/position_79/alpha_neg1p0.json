    "text": " So, that seems correct. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering each digit position separately and using a formula. For the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated using a formula, but maybe it's easier to count manually here since n isn't too large. Alternatively, I could use the formula for each digit position. Let me try that for the units place: For the units digit, the number of times 4 appears is floor(488/10) + (if the units digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, actually, the formula is a bit more precise. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is: (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10) if d !=0. Wait, maybe I should think differently. For units digit 4, the number of times it appears is the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 // 10 =48, and then check if the remaining digits (488 %10 =8) are >=4, so we add 1 more, making it 49. So that's correct. Similarly, for the tens place, the number of times 4 appears is calculated by looking at the higher digits and the lower digits. The formula is: higher = n // 100, current = (n // 10) %10, lower = n %10. If current >4, then count += (higher +1)*10. If current ==4, count += (higher)*10 + (lower +1). If current <4, count += higher *10. So, for n=488, let's compute for tens digit 4: higher =488//100=4, current=(488//10)%10=8, lower=488%10=8. Since current=8>4, count += (4+1)*10=50. So, that's 50, which matches our earlier count. Similarly, for hundreds place, the formula would be similar, but since we're dealing with 488, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, that's correct. For the 8's, let's apply the formula as well to confirm. Units digit 8: higher =488//10=48, current=488%10=8. Since current >=8, count += (48)*1 + (8-8+1)=48+1=49. Correct. Tens digit 8: higher=488//100=4, current=(488//10)%10=8, lower=488%10=8. Since current=8 >=8, count += (4+1)*10=50, but wait, that's not quite right because from 480-488, it's only 9 numbers. Wait, maybe the formula needs adjustment. Wait, the formula for the tens digit when current digit is 8: higher=4, current=8, lower=8. So, the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is (higher)*10 + (lower +1). Wait, no, actually, when current digit is 8, the count is (higher +1)*10 if lower digits are >=0. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the formula. Let me think again. The formula for the tens digit: The number of times 8 appears in the tens place is calculated by:\n\n- The higher part is 488//100=4.\n- The current digit is (488//10)%10=8.\n- The lower part is 488%10=8.\n\nIf current >8: count += (higher +1)*10\nIf current ==8: count += (higher)*10 + (lower +1)\nIf current <8: count += higher *10\n\nSince current=8, which is equal to 8, so count += (4)*10 + (8 +1)=40+9=49. That's correct because from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, but the formula accounts for all the previous sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) which are 4 sets of 10, totaling 40, plus the 9 in the last partial set. So, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula confirms that the number of 8's in the tens place is 49, and in the units place, it's 49, totaling 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

    "text": " So, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using digit positions and calculating occurrences more systematically. For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. Let's try that approach to verify. For 4's: - Units place: In each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full blocks of 10 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more numbers (481-488). Each block contributes 1 four in the units place, so 48 fours. Plus, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So total units fours:48 +1=49. Correct. - Tens place: In each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each. So, for the tens digit being 4, each 100 block contributes 10 fours. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, but wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. The tens digit is 4 in 401-410, which is 10 numbers, but 401-488 includes 401-409 (9 numbers) and 410-488. Wait, no, 401-488: the tens digit is 4 in 401-409 (tens digit 0), wait no, 401-410 would have tens digit 0 for 401-410? Wait, no. Wait, 401 is 4 0 1, so tens digit is 0. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, from 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, except maybe the last one if it's cut off. But 440-449 is within 488, so 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. Correct. - Hundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Same as before. For 8's: - Units place: Each block of 10 has one 8. From 1-488, there are 48 full blocks (480 numbers), each contributing one 8 in units place, so 48 eights. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total units eights:48 +1=49. Correct. - Tens place: The tens digit is 8 in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights each, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens eights:40 +9=49. Correct. - Hundreds place: No 8's since the book only goes up to 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 =90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

So, for the tens digit, in each hundred block, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so each digit appears 10 times per hundred. So, up to 400-488, which is 89 numbers, the tens digit 4 appears how many times? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so 440-449 is within 488. So, that's 10 numbers. So, the tens digit 4 appears 5 times 10 (from 0-400, each hundred has 10 tens 4's) plus 10 from 400-488? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, from 0-99: tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). From 100-199: same, 10 times. 200-299:10. 300-399:10. 400-488: the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. So, that's correct. Similarly, the hundreds digit 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Units digit: 4 appears every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 times. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units digit: same logic, 49 times. Tens digit: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 10 each for the first four sets, and 9 for the last set, totaling 49. Hundreds digit: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This occurs every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This occurs every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
