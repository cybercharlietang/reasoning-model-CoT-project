    "text": " Well, starting from 4, each subsequent occurrence is 10 numbers apart. So, how many such numbers are there up to 488? Let's see, the first 4 in the units place is 4, and the last would be 484. To find the total count, I can use the formula: number of terms = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another block. So, how many blocks is that? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, 440-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. Starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence would be 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let me check each block. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the hundreds place, the last block is only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, let me count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can also appear in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 4 at maximum. So, the hundreds place never has an 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Let's see: the first number is 4, then every 10 numbers after that. So, how many sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the 49th set would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last number with 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 4, 14, ..., 484, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check that again. If I take 488 and divide by 10, I get 48.8, which means there are 48 complete decades and then 8 extra numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as for each complete set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one number ending with 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? That's 48 complete sets (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490, but we only go up to 488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last set is 481-490, but we stop at 488. So, in each of the 48 complete sets, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the incomplete set from 481-488, does 484 fall into this? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's an additional 1. So total 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. Let's think about how often that happens. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 8 in the units place, so that's included. So, from 8, 18, ..., 488, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, total 4 full ranges (each contributing 10) and one partial range with 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check. For 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of such numbers: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89 (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of such numbers: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Four full ranges contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and the last range contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one number ending with 4. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the total number of such blocks. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th block would end at 480, and then we have 481 to 488. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 4's are there? Let's see: the first 4 is at 4, then every 10 after that. So, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms are in this sequence, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Here, a_1 = 4, d = 10, and a_n = 484. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, but here it's 49. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check: from 1 to 480, how many 4's in the units place? 480/10 = 48. Then, from 481 to 488, there's another 4 at 484. So, total 49. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, all these ranges are within 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many terms are in this sequence. Using the same approach: a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10. The last term less than or equal to 488 is 488 itself, but 488 ends with an 8, so it's included. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one '4'. From 1 to 488, there are 49 such numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens Place:** Ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contribute 10 '4's.

From 1 to 488, there are 49 such numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens Place:** Ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contribute 10 '8's. The last range (480-488) contributes 9 '8's, totaling 49 '8's.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th set would end at 480, and then we have 481 to 488, which is 8 more numbers. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from 1-480) plus one more at 484. Wait, 480 + 4 is 484, which is within 488. So, that's 49 times? Wait, no, let me think again. From 1 to 480, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times (since 480/10=48). Then, from 481 to 488, we have 484 as the next occurrence, which is the 49th occurrence. So, total 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only interested in how many times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place, which is once for each number in that range. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, that's 49 times. Let me check: from 1-480, that's 48 sets, each with an 8 in the units place, so 48 numbers. Then, 488 is the 49th. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 numbers each and 1 range with 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would happen in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (48 from 1-480 and 1 at 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the range 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (48 from 1-480 and 1 at 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four ranges: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Last range (480-488): 9 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see, the first is 4, then every 10th number after that. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units digit across all page numbers. To find this, I can divide the total number of pages by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there's an extra 4 in the units place at 484? Wait, no, 484 is within 488, so actually, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is 49, because 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Let me check: 484 is 48*10 + 4, so 484 is included. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is beyond 48*10=480, we have one more 4 in 484, which is 484=48*10 +4, so that's 49 times. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these decades contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such decades there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 decades, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. However, we need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, let's add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, which ends with 8, that's 49 times. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10. That's 4 decades, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. But wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? 480-489 would be the next decade, but since our book ends at 488, 480-488 are included. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. So, total tens place 8's: 4 decades (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10, so 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but actually, it's 49. Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each of the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each of the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 9 times in 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, so 48 times. Wait, but let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48*10 is 480, so the last page is 488, which is 480 + 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 is in 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 48 times. Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Oh, so I made a mistake earlier. It's actually 49 times because 488 is the 49th term. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, the number of 8's in the tens place is 4 blocks *10 + 1 block *9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, total 98. Difference: 187 - 98 = 89. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers.

Wait, but wait a second, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 49 numbers ending with 4 because 484 is the last one, and 484 is the 49th number (since 484 = 48*10 + 4). Let me check: starting at 4, every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens digit. The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Well, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 449 exist? Yes, because the book goes up to 488. So, 440-449 is valid. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, looking at the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. So, adding up the counts: units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, numbers like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488 is the last one. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199:180-189 (10). From 200-299:280-289 (10). From 300-399:380-389 (10). From 400-488: Does 480-489 exist? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's only 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the hundreds place, when hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 8 only up to 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs only 9 times (480-488). So, for the tens place, how many blocks? Let's see: From 0-99: 10. 100-199:10. 200-299:10. 300-399:10. 400-488:9. So total in tens place:10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because in each hundred, except the last one, the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times. But in the last hundred (400-488), it's only 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, 4 blocks of 10 (0-399) and one block of 9 (400-488). So total tens place 8's:4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 times. Adding up the counts: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total 8's:49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first such number is 4, and the last is 484. To find how many there are, I can use the formula: ((Last - First) / Step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, I should check if 440-449 is within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's are units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last one has 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place: same as 4's, 49. So, total 98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. That seems correct. So, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - Numbers ending with 4: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Total: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Numbers with 4 in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each range has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.  \n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - Numbers with 4 in the hundreds place: 400-488.  \n   - Total: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - Numbers ending with 8: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Total: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Numbers with 8 in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - The first four ranges have 10 numbers each, and the last range (480-488) has 9 numbers.  \n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).  \n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete groups and a partial group. In each complete group, there's exactly one number with a 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), does 484 fall into this? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that adds one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book ends at 488, 449 is okay because 449 < 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4, which occurs from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's an extra 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8, which occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four ranges, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Wait, does 480-489 fall within the book? The book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the book. But the tens digit here is 8, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. So, that's another 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, actually, the tens place 8 occurs in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was four ranges, but now it's five because 480-488 is another. So, actually, 49 times in the tens place. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total 10\u00d74 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. 8 is not a hundreds digit in any page number here, because the highest is 488, which is 4 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 (48 \u00d7 10 = 480) plus one more in 484.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 (48 \u00d7 10 = 480) plus one more in 488.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last range (480-488) has 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, starting from 4 and adding 10 each time until we reach 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: (Last term - First term) / Common difference + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which would be in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many sets of ten there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these sets has 10 numbers, except maybe the last one if it goes beyond 488. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so each set has 10 numbers. How many such sets are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first set, then each hundred has another set. So, 40-49 (1 set), 140-149 (another set), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Wait, but wait a second. When I get to 440-449, that's 10 numbers, but 449 is within 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place, which would be in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all of these, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only for 400-499, but since our book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count the sets. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: that's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, how many sets? 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10 numbers, and one partial set (480-488) with 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 5 sets.\n   - Number of terms: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) with 10 each, and 480-488 with 9.\n   - Number of terms: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let me calculate that. The first number is 4, and the last number ending with 4 before 488 is 484. To find how many terms are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: (Last term - First term) / Common difference + 1. Here, the first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the last one, and 484 + 10 would be 494, which is beyond 488, so that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count the 4's in the tens place. These numbers would be 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the ranges are 40-49 (which is within 1-488), 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's five ranges. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check the last number ending with 8 before or equal to 488. The last such number would be 488 itself, since 488 ends with 8. So, how many terms? Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8's in the tens place. These would be numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the range. Let me see how many ranges there are. Starting from 80-89, that's one. Then 180-189, another. 280-289, another. 380-389, another. And then 480-488. So that's five ranges. Now, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4 ranges * 10 = 40. The last range, 480-488, has 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The numbers from 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see: The first number is 4, and the last number ending with 4 before 488 is 484. To find how many there are, I can take the range from 4 to 484, stepping by 10 each time. So, the count would be ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is the 49th number. Hmm, but 484 is the last one before 488, so that seems correct.

But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, I need to do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last number ending with 8 is 488. So, how many such numbers are there? Let's calculate: The first number is 8, and the last is 488. The count is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the 49th number. Let me check: 8, 18, 28,..., 488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, from 400-488, the next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. Let's see: Each of these ranges has 10 numbers except the last one, which might be cut short. Let's count them: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total for tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. Number of terms: (484-4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488. 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. When I considered 480-488, I counted 9 numbers. Let me confirm: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers because 488-480=8, so 8+1=9. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Correct.\n\nSo, I think the calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** Numbers ending with 4 occur every 10 pages (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n     - Total count: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n     - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n     - Total count: 5 * 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Numbers from 400-488, where the hundreds digit is 4.\n     - Total count: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Numbers ending with 8 occur every 10 pages (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - Total count: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n     - Each range contributes 10 numbers except the last, which contributes 9 (480-488).\n     - Total count: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - Total count: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete cycles of 10 are there in 488? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, there are 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the 48th cycle would end at 480, and then we have 481 to 488. In that last partial cycle, 484 is within 481-488, so that's an extra 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, is that right? Let me check: from 1-488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is indeed floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last number is >= 484, which it is, so +1, making 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the following ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check the last block. 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The last partial cycle is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's an extra 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but let me check: from 1-488, the units digit cycles 48 full times, each giving one 8, and then 488 is the last number, which is a multiple of 10 (since 488 mod 10 is 8), so yes, that's 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers. Wait, no: 480 is the first, and 488 is the last, so that's 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, so 9 numbers including both). So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, but the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks * 10 + 1 block * 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me count again: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place: 0 8's. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct because 488-400+1=89. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, and the last block is 10 numbers as well because 440-449 is within 488. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place. That's correct. For 8's, in the tens place, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 in total. Units place:49, correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me check the units place again. For 4's: from 1-488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24,...,484. So, how many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, (n-1)*10 \u2264 484 \u21d2 n-1 \u2264 48.4 \u21d2 n \u2264 49.4, so n=49. So, 49 4's in the units place. Similarly for 8's: 8,18,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, (n-1)*10 \u2264 480 \u21d2 n-1 \u2264 48 \u21d2 n=49. So, 49 8's in units place. That's correct. For the tens place, 4's: 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. Correct. For 8's in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks are 10 numbers each, the last is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 4's: 89, 8's:0. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences (with the last block being 480-488, which has 9 numbers).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no page numbers in the 800s.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see, the first number is 4 and the last is 484. The total count would be (484 - 4)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is within 488. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 488. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in that block. Wait, no, 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449. So that's another 10 numbers. So total in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 10. So total 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Because from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for every number, so that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first number is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last one is 480-488. So, each block of 100 contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I overcounted the tens place for 4's. Let me think again. When counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each giving 10 numbers, so 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. That seems correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 1-400, 4 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 40. Then from 401-488, 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct too. So, the difference is indeed 90.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first number is 4, then every 10th number after that. So, the count would be the number of times 4 appears in the units place. To calculate this, I can divide 488 by 10 and take the integer part, then see if the last number includes a 4. Let me see: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last group goes up to 488, so does 488 include a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with 8. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. Wait, but wait, let me check. Starting from 4, every 10th number: 4,14,24,...,484. So, 484 is the last one before 488. So, how many terms are there? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The formula for the number of terms is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Oh, so I made a mistake earlier. It's actually 49 times. Because 484 is included, which is the 49th term. So, units place: 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449. How many blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 (block 1), 140-149 (block 2), 240-249 (block 3), 340-349 (block 4), 440-449 (block 5). So, 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but hold on. The book only goes up to 488. The last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me confirm. 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, the count is indeed 89. So, hundreds place: 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many such numbers there are. Using the same method as for 4's: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, does 488 end with 8? Yes, 488 is included. So, the last number is 488, which is the 49th term. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these blocks. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. So, that's 4 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 480-489 is included. Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of the tens place as 48x, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, 8 is in the tens digit, so 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place. But 480 is 480, which is 4 8 0, so yes, 8 is in the tens place. So, does that add another block? Wait, no, because 80-89 is the first block, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, that's 5 blocks? Wait, no, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 5 blocks. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), but in the tens place, the 8 is in the tens digit, so each of these 9 numbers has 8 in the tens place. So, how many eights in the tens place? For the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 eights. The fifth block is 480-488, which contributes 9 eights. So total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 blocks, but now it's 5. Let me clarify. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's think differently. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. But in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total number of times 8 appears in the tens place: for each hundred except the last, it's 10 times, and for the last hundred, it's 9 times. How many hundreds are there? 400-488 is the last hundred, so up to 4 hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the 400s. So, the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in the first four hundreds, each has a block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 4. The last such number is 484. The count is ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8. The last such number is 488. The count is ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 4 full blocks (each contributing 10) and one partial block contributing 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a number, it's 48 times, but wait, let me check. The last number with 4 in the units place is 484, which is 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, the last block, 440-449, is within 488, so it's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but wait, 488 is included, so the last number is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 49 times? Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48 times, plus one more for 488? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me think: numbers ending with 8 are 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms are there? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (n-1)*10=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49+40=89. So, 89 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 187 - 89 = 98. So, there are 98 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, with the 49th group ending at 488. Thus, 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (since 488 is included).\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) = 89.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's (187) - Number of 8's (89) = 98.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 98.  \n\\boxed{98}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that means there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times, because in each group of 10, there's exactly one number ending with 4. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, from 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. Wait, but 401-488 is only 88 numbers, not a full 100. So, let me calculate how many full hundreds there are. From 1-400, there are 4 full hundreds. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, what about the last partial block, 401-488? The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in this partial block, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? Yes, 440 is 440, and 449 is 449, which is less than 488. So, that's another 10 numbers. Therefore, the total number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 40 (from the full hundreds) + 10 (from the partial hundred) = 50. Wait, but wait a second. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, actually, the total is 4 full hundreds (each contributing 10) and 1 partial hundred contributing another 10, so 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50. That seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, let's add up all the occurrences of 4: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process for 8: units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But let's check the last partial group: 481-488. The units digit 8 occurs once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (from 488) = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred block contributes 10 such numbers. From 1-400, there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's 4\u00d710 = 40. Now, the last partial block is 401-488. The tens digit here goes up to 8, as in 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial block. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n- **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 instances. Additionally, 488 includes another 4 in the units place (484), totaling 48.\n- **Tens Place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred contributes 10 such numbers. With 4 full hundreds (400 numbers), that's 40 instances. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, adding another 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n- **Units Place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 itself is 488, which doesn't end with a 4. So, the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 48th group. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check: starting from 4, 14, 24,..., 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. It should be 49 times because 484 is the 49th term. Let me confirm: from 4 to 484, that's 4, 14, 24,..., 484. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term)/common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another range. So, that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488. Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes, because it's page 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? Let's use the same approach. From 8 to 488, step of 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place would be numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this range. Let me count the number of ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges. The first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each have 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so the last 4 in the units place is 484.

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100.

But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 = 98, and 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. The last 8 in the units place is 488, so that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's count the blocks: 80-89 is the first, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, wait, is there a 480-489 block? But since the book only goes up to 488, the 480-488 numbers are included, but the tens digit is 8 only from 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 numbers, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, I think I need to adjust that. So, the first four blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each with 10 numbers, totaling 40. Then, the 480-488 block adds 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. Wait, let me check that again. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 49 times. Hundreds place: 0. So, 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's: 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 97. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place 48, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units place 48, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. 48 + 49 = 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me recount that. The tens place for 8's: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and then 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 in the tens place. So, 48 units + 49 tens = 97. So, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times (5 blocks \u00d7 10 numbers).\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., plus 480-488, totaling 49 times (4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9).\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one number ending with 4. So, how many blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last block might not be complete. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks and 8 extra numbers. So, the last block is 480-488, which includes 484. So, that's 48 times 4's in the units place. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 numbers ending with 4. Then, from 481 to 488, we have 484, which is another 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, because 480 is included in the 48 blocks, so maybe it's just 48 times? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think differently. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is given by floor(n/10) + (1 if the last digit is >= d else 0). So, for 4's in units place, n=488. floor(488/10) = 48. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1. So, total 4's in units place: 48 +1 = 49. Okay, that makes sense. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond. Let me count how many such blocks there are. Each block is 100 numbers, and in each block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, how many full blocks are there? From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does the last block go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate. floor(488/10) = 48. The last digit is 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1. So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's see. Each block of 100 numbers has a 80-89 block. So, from 1-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. 400-488: 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but there are only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. Difference:188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** A 4 appears every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers will have one 4 in the units place. So, the total number is the number of tens in 488, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, it's 48 times. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 49 sets of 10 numbers, right? Because the last set is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, actually, it's 48 full tens (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490, but stopping at 488). Wait, maybe I should think of it as 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we're counting complete groups, it's 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, let me check: from 1-10, 4 is in 4. From 11-20, 14. From 21-30, 24. And so on, up to 481-490, but since we stop at 488, the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, how many 4's in the units place? Let's calculate it as follows: The first 4 in the units place is at 4, then every 10 after that. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in each ten's group. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete ten's groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, that's okay. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is 488, so from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. But wait, 488 is 488, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 1-99, there's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. 240-249, another 10. 340-349, another 10. 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, the tens digit 4 appears 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can be 4. So, numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Okay, so 187 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's see. The 8 in the units place appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, which is 488, so that's the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, the last range is 480-488. So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, but the last range (480-488) has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and 1 range with 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units:48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: Units:48, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, resulting in 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contribute 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place.\n   - There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers from 400-488 each have a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contribute 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place.\n   - The first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 40 occurrences.\n   - The last range (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers fall in the 800-899 range, so there are 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **97**\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 97 = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see, 4, 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94, 104, 114, ..., 484. To find how many there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include 484? Let me check: 484 is the last number ending with 4 before 488. So, yes, 484 is included. So that's 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the following ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 gives 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98, 108, 118, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so 48 full decades. But wait, does 488 end with 8? Yes, 488 is included. So, how many numbers end with 8? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The last number is 488, which is 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Solving for n: 488 = 8 + 10(n-1) => 480 = 10(n-1) => n-1 = 48 => n=49. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, if I take 488 divided by 10, it's 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but the 49th cycle would be 480-489, but 488 is within that. So, does that mean there are 49 numbers ending with 8? Wait, let me list them: 8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98,108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198,208,218,228,238,248,258,268,278,288,298,308,318,328,338,348,358,368,378,388,398,408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let me count these. From 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers (80-89). - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit from the right):** The digit 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. There are 48 such numbers (since 484 is the 48th occurrence).\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit from the right):** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit from the right):** The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488. This gives 89 occurrences (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see: the first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 itself doesn't end with 4, so it's exactly 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is page 488, which is beyond 480. So, the last 4 in the units place would be 484, right? So, from 4 to 484, that's 48 numbers. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349, each contributing 10. Then 440-449, which is also 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check each place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so how many such numbers? Let's see: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: the first is 8, the last is 488. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, let's see how many full blocks there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens place 8's are: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one partial block of 9. So, total 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, no, wait: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, that's 4 x 10 = 40 plus 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can be 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

This gives 49 numbers.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference = 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let me calculate: The first such number is 4, and the last is 484. To find how many, I can subtract 4 from 484 and divide by 10, then add 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 = 480/10 = 48, then 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is the last one, so 484 is the 49th number ending with 4. Hmm, that seems right. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149 is another, 240-249 another, 340-349 another, and 440-449 another. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, I need to count how many times 8 appears. Let's do the same process for 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last number ending with 8 is 488. So, let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48, then 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. So, ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let me count how many such ranges there are within 1-488. 80-89: yes, that's 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, what about 480-489? Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. So, from 480 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? Let's see: 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, and 488 is the last, so 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus the partial range 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488)\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, starting from 4, each subsequent occurrence is 10 apart. So, how many terms are there in this sequence up to 488? Let's see: The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. The number of terms can be calculated by ((Last term - First term) / Common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many such sets there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. But wait, let me check the last set. 440-449: 440, 441,...,449. That's 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Let me see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. Common difference is 10. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's see how many sets there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four sets each contribute 10, and the last set contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that's 90. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, 49 in tens place. Units place was 49, so total 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I thought earlier the answer might be 90, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct. For 8's, in the hundreds place, none, so 0. So, yes, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 sets: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - First four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the total number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then we have 8 remaining numbers (481-488). In those, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing one set of 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. But wait, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the 4 in the tens place occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's already included in the 4 sets. Wait, no, because 400-488 is part of the 5th hundred, but since 488 is less than 500, we only have up to 488. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers. Wait, no, because 488 is less than 500, so the last set is 440-449, which is within 488. So, total sets are 5, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 sets, but actually, it's 5 sets because 0-488 includes 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs once. So, from 0-488, that's 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Each of these has a set where the tens digit is 4, except the last one, 400-488, which does have 440-449. So, total sets are 5, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, similar to 4's, but let's check. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8, so 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8? Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many sets? Let's see: 0-488 includes 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. In each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs once, except the last one. So, from 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, total tens places with 8: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\), plus one more in 488.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers except the last, which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one number ending with 4. So, how many blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th block ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. So, does the 48th block include 480, which is 48*10=480, so yes, 480 is included. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 numbers ending with 4. Then, from 481-488, the next number ending with 4 would be 484, which is within 481-488. So, that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 480 is the 48th multiple of 10, so 480 is included in the 48th block, and then 484 is the next one, which is in the 49th block, but since 488 is the last page, 484 is within 481-488. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place (second digit):** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which would be numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one block. Then 140-149: another. 240-249: another. 340-349: another. 440-449: another. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 numbers where the tens digit is 4. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which would be numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4. Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many such numbers there are. From 1 to 488, every block of 10 has one number ending with 8. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. The last block is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place (second digit):** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count the blocks. 80-89: one block. 180-189: another. 280-289: another. 380-389: another. So that's 4 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, check if 480-488 includes any numbers with 8 in the tens place. 480-488: the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488? Wait, 480 has tens digit 8? Wait, 480 is 4 8 0, so yes, the tens digit is 8. So, 480-488 includes numbers where the tens digit is 8, which is from 480 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Wait, but in the tens place, the digit is 8 for all these numbers because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, etc., up to 488, which is 4 8 8. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, I think I missed that earlier. So, the blocks are 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds place never has an 8. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the hundreds place would have 0, but let me confirm. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, yes, 0. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but earlier when counting the 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me double-check my counts because 90 seems a bit high. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. I had 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, we had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49 numbers, as from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4, and the last partial block (481-488) includes 484, so 49.\n\nUnits place for 8's: same logic, 49.\n\nSo, the counts seem correct. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nBut wait, when counting the 4's in the tens place, 440-449: that's 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. When counting the units place for 4's, I considered 484 as the last one in the 481-488 range. But 488 is the last page, so 484 is indeed the last one ending with 4 before 488. So, yes, 49 units place 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the last one in units place is 488, which is included, so 49.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (480 numbers), each contributing one 4.\n   - The last partial decade (481-488) includes 484, adding one more 4.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (second digit):**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (third digit):**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n- Units: 49 + Tens: 50 + Hundreds: 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8.\n   - The last partial decade (481-488) includes 488, adding one more 8.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (second digit):**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges each have 10 numbers, and the last range (480-488) has 9 numbers.\n   - Total: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (third digit):**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n- Units: 49 + Tens: 49 + Hundreds: 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 there are. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), there's another 4 at 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, let me think again. Actually, every 10 numbers contribute exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 groups of 10, so 48 fours. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers, and 484 is one of them, so that's one more. So total 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, the last range would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, how many such ranges? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. From 1 to 488, how many groups of 10? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), there's 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count the ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, so in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, and there are 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (48 from 1-480 and one in 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see: the first number is 4, and the last is 484. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. The common difference is 10. The nth term is given by a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtracting 4 gives 480 = (n-1)*10, so n-1 = 48, thus n = 49. So, there are 49 numbers where 4 is in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let me check how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So that's 5*10=50. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me double-check: 400 is included, and 488 is the last. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, the last number ending with 8 is 488. Let's count how many such numbers. The sequence starts at 8, ends at 488, with a common difference of 10. So, using the same formula: a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 488 - 8 = (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 numbers where 8 is in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, does 480-489 exist? Well, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the 8 occurs in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total numbers: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears in the page numbers. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first number is 4, and the last is 484. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1. Let me compute that: (484 - 4) is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, I need to check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can be in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1. Let me compute: (488 - 8) = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be another range, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of that range. Let me count the number of such ranges. From 1-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. So that's 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 9 numbers. So total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

To find how many terms are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d. Here, a_1 = 4, d = 10, a_n = 484. Plugging in: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1 = 48 => n = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page. 484 is within 488, so that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 4's. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, contributing 10 4's. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which is in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence approach: a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 => 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next range, but since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. So, that's 48 times. But wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens and a partial tenth. The last page is 488, which is in the 48th ten (480-488). So, in each of these tens, there's exactly one number ending with 4. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place (second digit):** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another block. Let me count: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the last one, which ends with 8. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is a partial block because 488 is the last page. Let me count the blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each full block (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4 blocks x 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that's a big difference. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems right. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, seems correct.

Wait, but wait, 484 is the last one. Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers.

So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, then 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in numbers like 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last number ending with 8 is 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last block. Each full block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last block, 480-488, only has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).

So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10. Let me calculate that: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 itself end with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Well, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but the last block is 400-488. Does that affect the count? Let me think. The tens digit in 400-488 can be 4 only from 440-449, right? Because from 400-439, the tens digit is 0-3, and from 440-449, it's 4. Then from 450-488, the tens digit is 5-8. So actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times. So, from 0-488, how many hundreds? 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, in the 400-488 block, as I thought earlier, only 440-449 have the tens digit as 4, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 in total. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, meaning 48 occurrences. But wait, 488 is included, which is 488. So, the last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no. Because 488 is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, from 8, 18, ..., 488. Let's see: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so the number of times 8 appears in the units place is 48 times for the first 480 numbers, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th multiple? Wait, no, 8 \u00d7 1 = 8, 8 \u00d7 2 = 16, but wait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in 488 numbers, the units digit cycles 48 full times (480 numbers) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each cycle of 10, 8 appears once. So, 48 full cycles give 48 eights, and in the last partial cycle (481-488), 8 appears once (at 488). So total is 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, maybe I was right. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let me calculate how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full block (like 80-89) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such full blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189 is another. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks. But wait, 480-488 is not a full block because it ends at 488 instead of 489. So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place: 4 full blocks (each contributing 10 numbers) and one partial block contributing 9 numbers. Wait, no, actually, 480-488 is a partial block because 489 would be the next, but we stop at 488. So, let me count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 - 280-289: 10 - 380-389: 10 - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 10\u00d74=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Hmm, but for 8's tens place, it's 49 times. Let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189: 10. From 200-299: 280-289: 10. From 300-399: 380-389: 10. From 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total is 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 can appear in the hundreds place. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because 488 is the last page, which is 4 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought units was 49 and tens was 49, so total 98. But wait, let me double-check the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, yes, 49 times in the units place. Similarly, in the tens place, as calculated, 49 times. So, total 98 times. Wait, but earlier I thought in the units place, 4 appears 48 times, but 8 appears 49 times. So, 4's total is 187, and 8's total is 98. Therefore, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, 4's are printed 89 times more than 8's. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's and 8's separately. For 4's: units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. Total: 48+50=98; 98+89=187. For 8's: units place: 49 times. Tens place: 49 times. Hundreds place: 0. Total: 49+49=98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, 4's are printed 89 more times than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such numbers (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks of 100, such as 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). However, in the 400-488 block, only 440-449 have 4 in the tens place, contributing 10 numbers. Thus, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - **Total for 4:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, plus the last number 488).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each full block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 4 full blocks. The last block (480-488) contributes 9 numbers. Thus, 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total for 8:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe digit 4 is printed 89 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see. The first number ending with 4 is 4, and the last is 484. The difference between 484 and 4 is 480, and since they're spaced every 10, the number of such numbers is 480 / 10 + 1 = 49. Wait, is that right? Let me check. 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full tens, plus the starting point 4 makes 49 numbers. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one set. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So, that's five sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but the last set is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes. So, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, the last is 488. The difference is 488 - 8 = 480. Divided by 10 is 48, so 48 + 1 = 49 numbers. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. That would be numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Let me check: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, right? So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, contributing 4 x 10 = 40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see, the first one is 4, then every 10 after that. So, 4, 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94, 104, and so on. To find out how many there are, I can divide 488 by 10 and take the integer part. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have a units digit of 4? No, it ends with 8. So, the last number ending with 4 is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, but let me check: 484 is 48*10 + 4, so yes, that's correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but let me check: 400 is included, so 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. The last number ending with 8 is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, because 488 is included, so it's 49 times. Let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The count is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is 8. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, yes, so 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges? From 0-99: 80-89. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-489. But wait, 480-489 is within 400-488, so that's another range. So, that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 480-489 is only up to 488, so does that affect the count? Let me see: 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, does that mean the tens place 8's in the hundreds place (400-488) is only 9 numbers? Wait, but when counting digit occurrences, each number in 480-488 has an 8 in the tens place, except 488, which has 8 in both tens and units. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, for the hundreds place (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the count for tens place 8's is: 4 ranges with 10 numbers each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 numbers in 480-488, so total 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 5 ranges, but one of them only has 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 49. Let me double-check: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49. 49 + 49 = 98. Difference: 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but I feel like I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 5 ranges each with 10 numbers, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So, that's correct. So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50. So, 4's count is correct. For 8's, in the tens place, I had 49, which includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers.

So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So total tens place 4's: 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 50. So 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? From 1 to 488, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, does 488 count? 488 is 8 in the units place, so that's included in the 48th cycle, which ends at 480. Wait, no, 480 is the end of the 48th cycle, so the next cycle is 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so in the units place, the 8's are at 8,18,...,488. So how many? Let's see: the first 8 is at 8, then every 10. The last one is 488. So the number of 8's in units place is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, but that can't be right because 488 is the 49th term. Wait, let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so in 488 pages, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's floor(488/10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So total units place 8's: 48 +1 =49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next range, but our book ends at 488, so the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let's check each range: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 4 ranges \u00d710 +1\u00d79 =40 +9=49. Wait, but let me count again: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This occurs from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 =90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems high. Did I make a mistake in counting the 4's or 8's? Let me recount the 4's. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The formula is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. So 49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now, for the 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. ((488-8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So 4 ranges \u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So total 8's:49+49=98. So the difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four ranges have 10 each, last has 9.\n   - Total: 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit (book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first such number is 4, and the last is 484. To find how many there are, I can calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count them: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers So that's 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 numbers. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, in the hundreds place, only the hundreds digit is 4. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: Units + Tens + Hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and 1 range with 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book has only 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: Units + Tens + Hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4. But wait, the last block is 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so does that affect the count? Hmm, actually, 488 is the last page, so the last number in the units place is 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so the 48th block ends at 480. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Each block is 10 numbers, so from 1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the last block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. But in the units place, the 4 would appear in 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in the units place for the last block, the 4 appears once (at 484). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from the first 48 blocks) plus 1 (from the last partial block), totaling 49. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me check. Each full block of 10 has one 4 in the units place. From 1-480, there are 48 blocks, each contributing one 4, so that's 48. Then, from 481-488, we have 484, which is the only number with a 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, we have four blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is the fifth block, and 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many 8's are in the units place? Each block of 10 has one 8, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. The last partial block is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, 480-489 would be the next block, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last one. So, how many blocks are there? From 1-488, we have five blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks are full, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 8's in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total units place 4's:  \n     - From 1-480: 48 occurrences.  \n     - From 481-488: 1 occurrence (484).  \n     - **Total:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Number of such blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - **Total tens place 4's:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.  \n   - **Total hundreds place 4's:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total units place 8's:  \n     - From 1-480: 48 occurrences.  \n     - From 481-488: 1 occurrence (488).  \n     - **Total:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Number of full blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).  \n   - Partial block (480-488): 9 occurrences.  \n   - **Total tens place 8's:** (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - **Total hundreds place 8's:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the 48th group ends at 480, and then there's an incomplete group from 481-488. But in the units place, the next 4 would be 484, which is within 480-488. So, actually, there's another 4 in the units place at 484. So, total units place 4's would be 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (484), totaling 49. Wait, but let me check: from 1-480, how many 4's in the units place? It's 480/10 = 48. Then, from 481-488, the next 4 in units is 484, so that's one more. So, total 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within range, but 540-549 would be beyond 488. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have a 4 in the tens place. From 1-99: 40-49 is one set, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers (440-449). So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4, which is true for all these numbers. So, how many 4's in the hundreds place? Each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89 fours. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? From 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. That's 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 480-488, which includes 488. So, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's included in the 48 groups. So, total units place 8's: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many sets. From 1-99: 80-89 is one set, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) equals 91.\n\nWait, let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:48+49=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: from 1-480, 48 numbers, plus 484, so 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's: from 1-488, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Plus, 488 has an 8, which is included in the 48th group? Wait, let me think. The first group is 1-10: 8 is in 8. Second group 11-20:18. ... 48th group would be 481-490, but our book ends at 488. So, the 48th group would be 481-488, which is 8 numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the 8's in this group would be 488, which is one. So, total units place 8's: 48 groups, each contributing one 8, but the 48th group only goes up to 488, so does that affect the count? Wait, no, because in each group of 10, the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, in the 48th group, which is 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, in the units place, 480 has 0, 481 has 1, ..., 488 has 8. So, the 8 in the units place is present once in this incomplete group. Therefore, total units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (488), totaling 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, so I might have made a mistake here. Let me clarify.\n\nEach group of 10 numbers has exactly one 8 in the units place. So, from 1-480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 groups of 10. So, 48 eights in the units place. Then, from 481-488, that's 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. So, I was wrong earlier; it's 49, not 48. That changes the total.\n\nSo, let's recalculate the 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo, now, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought units place 8's were 48, but upon rechecking, it's 49. Let me make sure.\n\nFrom 1-480: 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in units place: 48.\n\nThen, 481-488: 488 is included, which has an 8 in units place. So, that's one more, making it 49.\n\nSo, total 8's in units place:49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in tens place:49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nTherefore, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in units place were 48, but now it's 49. So, I need to adjust my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, let me correct that.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:98.\n\nNumber of 4's:188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again for 8's. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n\nAnd units place:49. So, total 98.\n\nYes, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"
