    "text": " Since the book goes up to 488, the last number with a 4 in the units place is 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10 and take the integer part. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 occurrences. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 = 48*10 + 4. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4's appear 187 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many times? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 = 48*10 + 8. So, 49 times? Wait, no. Let me check: from 1-488, the numbers ending with 8 are 8,18,28,...,488. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8's appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 occurrences. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8's in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, 8's appear 89 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 89 from 187: 187 - 89 = 98. Wait, that seems correct. But let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 187. For 8's: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. Total 89. Difference is 187 - 89 = 98. So, there are 98 more 4's than 8's. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).

    "text": " Let's see. The first occurrence is at 4, and the last occurrence in the units place before 488 would be 484. So, how many numbers is that? Well, from 4 to 484, each 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, let me check that. Alternatively, since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 itself is 488, which has an 8 in the units place, not a 4. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th set (since 484 = 48*10 + 4). So, that would be 48 times? Wait, but when I count from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 + 1 = 481 numbers, but that's not the right approach. Wait, maybe it's better to think that in each block of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 4's in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th block (48*10 = 480, so 480 + 4 = 484). So, that's 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. So, how many hundreds are there? 488 is less than 500, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the fourth hundred. So, let me think: the blocks where the tens digit is 4 are 40-49 (in 1-100), 140-149 (101-200), 240-249 (201-300), 340-349 (301-400), and 440-449 (401-500). But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 440-449, which is within 401-488. So, how many blocks is that? That's five blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the following blocks: 80-89 (1-100), 180-189 (101-200), 280-289 (201-300), 380-389 (301-400), and 480-488 (401-488). So, that's five blocks. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's each. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, no. Wait, the first four blocks are 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), so that's 4 blocks * 10 = 40. The fifth block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So total is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that can't be right because 187 - 98 is 89, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go through the counts again to ensure accuracy.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4. So, 48 4's in the units place.\n\n- Tens place: The blocks where tens digit is 4 are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units place: From 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's.\n\n- Tens place: Blocks are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: None, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let me consider the total number of digits. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can think about each digit position separately again.\n\nWait, another approach: For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nBut I think my initial approach is correct. So, the difference is 89.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Let's see. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the total number of page numbers divided by 10. But 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 itself end with a 4? No, it ends with an 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 4 to 484, that's 48 times. Wait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, meaning 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. So, the sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms in this sequence is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so I was wrong earlier. It's 49 times. Because 484 is the 49th term. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. That would be numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 488. Let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100, 40-49: 10 numbers. From 101-200, 140-149: 10 numbers. From 201-300, 240-249: 10 numbers. From 301-400, 340-349: 10 numbers. From 401-488, 440-449: 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, how many blocks of 100 do we have? From 1-400, there are four blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, we have another 10 numbers (440-449). So, total 40+10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4, which is true for all these numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. So, total 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms. The last term is 488, so the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many times this happens. From 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189: 10 numbers. From 201-300: 280-289: 10 numbers. From 301-400: 380-389: 10 numbers. From 401-488: 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488-480+1=9 numbers. So, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (each contributing 10) and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So, total 49+49+0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me verify the number of 4's again. Units place: 49, correct. Tens place: 50, correct. Hundreds place: 89, correct. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Now, number of 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 8's, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, 4 blocks of 10 (each giving 10 8's in the tens place) and one block of 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. So, yes, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let's see. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: the first 4 is at 4, and the last one would be at 484. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong before. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place is given by the floor division of the total number of pages by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which is 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, in the last group, from 480 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once at 484, which is within the 480-488 range. So, actually, it's 49 times for the units place. Wait, maybe I should use a formula. The formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + 1 if the units digit of n is >= d, else floor(n/10). Let me apply that. The units digit of 488 is 8, which is greater than 4, so the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many hundreds are there? 488 is less than 500, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), there's one full set of 10 numbers with tens digit 4. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last set, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, 400-488: the tens digit is 0-8 in the tens place. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400s, so does that count as a full set? Let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers. The tens digit in 400-488 ranges from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 50. Wait, but let me think again: from 0-99, 40-49: 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that addition: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Using the same formula as before: floor(488/10) + 1 if the units digit of 488 is >=8, which it is (8=8). So, floor(488/10)=48, plus 1: 49 times. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place. Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. 400-488: 480-488: but here, the tens digit is 8, but the units digit goes up to 8, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in this case, the tens place 8's are 480-488: 9 numbers. So, let's calculate: From 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that's 49 times. Let me confirm: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this happens 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in page numbers 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., but in the last range (480-488), it appears 9 times, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number.\n   - Total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, actually, in each group of 10, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so the 4 appears exactly once in each group. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since the last group might not be complete, I need to check if 488 is beyond 480. 488 is 8 more than 480, so the units digit 4 appears once in each of the 48 complete groups, and in the 48th group, the 4 is at 484, which is within 480-488. So, actually, it's 48 times. Wait, no, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since 488 is the last number, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. So, the first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers: 14,24,...,484. Let me calculate how many terms there are in this sequence. The first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. The formula for the number of terms is ((last term - first term)/common difference) +1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, that's 49 times. So, I think I was wrong earlier; it's 49 times. Because 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 numbers. So, how many ranges? 0-99: 1 range, 100-199: another, 200-299: another, 300-399: another, 400-488: another. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, let's add up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me count how many times. Using the same method as before: the first term is 8, last term is 488, common difference 10. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's check each range: 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the first four ranges, each contributes 10 numbers, and the last one contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would occur in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488)\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. The first 4 is at page 4, and the last one before 488 would be 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers are there where the units digit is 4? Well, every 10 numbers, so from 0 to 480, that's 48 times (since 480/10 = 48). Wait, but 480 is page 480, so 484 would be the 48th occurrence? Wait, no, because 4 is the first, then 14, 24,..., 484. So from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? Let me calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is page 484, so that's correct, 49 times. But wait, does 484 count as the 49th? Let me check: starting at 4, which is the first, then 14 is the second, and so on. So yes, 484 would be the 49th occurrence. So 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449, right? Because 450-488 would be beyond 449, but 440-449 is still within 488. So how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So from 1-99, that's once (40-49). From 100-199, that's another 10 (140-149). Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 more. So total in the tens place: 1 (from 1-99) + 1 (100-199) + 1 (200-299) + 1 (300-399) + 1 (400-488). Wait, no, each of those ranges contributes 10 numbers, so 10 each time. So 10 for each hundred. So how many hundreds are there? From 0-99: 1 set, 10-199: another set, etc. So total sets where tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 for pages 400-488. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes, because the units digit is 8. So how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's calculate. The first occurrence is at 8, then every 10 after that. So from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let me compute it as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the digit 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but the tens digit is 8 only from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488)\n\nSo total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think. The first occurrence is at 4, and the last occurrence before 488 would be 484. So, how many terms are in this sequence? The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 = 4, the common difference d = 10, and the last term an = 484. The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is an = a1 + (n - 1)d. Plugging in the values: 484 = 4 + (n - 1)*10. Subtract 4 from both sides: 480 = (n - 1)*10. Divide both sides by 10: 48 = n - 1. So, n = 49. That means there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. But does 484 + 10 = 494, which is beyond 488, so yes, 484 is the last one. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included because 488 ends with 8. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's use the arithmetic sequence formula again. a1 = 8, d = 10, an = 488. So, 488 = 8 + (n - 1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n - 1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n - 1. So, n = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, let's count each block. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488: how many numbers? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four blocks each have 10, and the last block has 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, every block of 10 numbers has one such number. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, it's 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, and 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So, from 4 to 484, that's 48 times? Wait, let me check: 4 is the first, then 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated as follows. The first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. The formula for the number of terms is ((last - first) / difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so there are 49 4's in the units place. I initially thought 48, but it's actually 49 because we start counting from 4. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens digit. The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let me calculate the number of terms. First term is 8, last term is 488. Common difference is 10. Number of terms = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit. The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's see how many blocks that is. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, the last block contributes 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. Correct. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. As calculated earlier, 49 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For the 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the total number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the incomplete group. The total number of pages is 488, so there are 48 complete decades (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). Each complete decade has exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the incomplete decade, which is 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is within this range, meaning there's one more 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Let's see. The first block is 40-49, which is in the first hundred (1-100). Then, 140-149 is the second hundred, 240-249 is the third, 340-349 is the fourth, and 440-449 is the fifth. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within the range. So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? From 1-400, there are 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred has one block where the tens digit is 4, so that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. That's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, which is 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that adds another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place: 4 * 10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but hold on. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 4's, so that's 4*10=40. Then, 440-449 is in 400-488, so that's another 10, making it 50. So, yes, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? The total number of pages is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 complete decades. Each contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the incomplete decade (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks (except possibly the last one) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count them: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 - 280-289: 10 - 380-389: 10 - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete decades (480 numbers) plus one more in 481-488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be the total number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, actually, from 1 to 480, there are exactly 48 times where the units digit is 4 (since 480/10 = 48). Then, from 481 to 488, the next units digit 4 would be 484, which is within this range. So that's one more, making it 49 times. Wait, no, that might not be correct because when we divide 488 by 10, it's 48.8, meaning there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times plus 1 more in the 484, totaling 49. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as for each group of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the 484, which is the 49th 4 in the units place. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, there's a block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, how many hundreds do we have? 488 is less than 500, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, the 400-488 range is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in each hundred block, there's exactly one block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 400-488 only goes up to 488, but 440-449 is within that, so yes, 10 numbers. So, total 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. But wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks, each with 10, so 4 x 10 = 40 times. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so 380-389 is within 488, so yes, 4 blocks. So, 40 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 89. So, the difference is 188 - 89 = 99.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49 (since 488 is included)\n- Tens: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10, so 40\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 40 = 89.

    "text": " Let's see. The first page with a 4 in the units place is 4, and the last is 484. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 = 4, the common difference d = 10, and the last term an = 484. To find the number of terms, I can use the formula for the nth term: an = a1 + (n-1)d. Plugging in the values: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4 from both sides: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide both sides by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. Wait, that seems high. Let me check. From 4 to 484, how many steps of 10 are there? 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, so there are 49 terms (including both endpoints). So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundred, the 40-49 range gives 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait a second. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's here. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, using the formula an = a1 + (n-1)d: 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Let me count each hundred: - 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). - 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). - 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). - 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 489 is beyond 488). So, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. I said 40-49, 140-149, etc., each giving 10 numbers. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149 is 10. 200-299: 240-249 is 10. 300-399: 340-349 is 10. 400-488: 440-449 is 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, that's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, 49 in total for the tens place. So, yes, 49+49=98 8's. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The last range contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let's see. The first occurrence is at 4, and the last occurrence before 488 is 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers are there? Well, the number of terms in this sequence can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers in each of these ranges. Each range has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers each = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, right? So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but I'm only considering the hundreds place here, so yes, 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes, because it's page 488. So, how many numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. Let's see: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me check: each range like 80-89 has 10 numbers, contributing 10 occurrences. How many such ranges? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four ranges are complete, each contributing 10, and the last one contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place, so 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), does the units digit include a 4? Yes, 484 is within this range. So, that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times this happens. Each hundred has a set of ten numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? Well, 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's five sets. Wait, but 400-488 is only 88 numbers, so the tens digit 4 in the hundreds place would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Let me calculate each hundred: - 1-99: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times. - 100-199: 140-149: 10 times. - 200-299: 240-249: 10 times. - 300-399: 340-349: 10 times. - 400-488: 440-449: 10 times. Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within that range, right? So, that's 10 numbers. So, adding them up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 times in the tens place. Wait, but wait, let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the tens digit from 400-488 would be 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 times in total for the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Wait, let me check my calculations again. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus one more in the last partial ten (484), so 49. That seems correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, etc.), so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since we only go up to 488, does that affect the count? Wait, in the tens place, for 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), 488 is included, so that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, let's count each hundred: - 1-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. - 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. - 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. - 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers. So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I might have miscounted the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. In the tens place, for 8's, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except for the last hundred (400-488), which only has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 hundreds with 10 each: 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last one, totaling 49. That's correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, including the last hundred (400-488), which has 10 numbers (440-449). So, 5 x 10 = 50. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups (480 numbers) plus 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - In each group, 4 appears once in the units place: 48 times.\n   - In the last partial group, 484 has a 4 in the units place: 1 more.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - There are 5 sets of hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences except the last set, which has 10 (440-449).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups plus 8 extra numbers.\n   - In each group, 8 appears once in the units place: 48 times.\n   - In the last partial group, 488 has an 8 in the units place: 1 more.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - There are 4 full sets of hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - The last set (400-488) contributes 9 occurrences (480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the last page with a 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one such number. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480/10 = 48 numbers. But wait, 480 divided by 10 is 48, but 488 is beyond 480, so we have an additional 8 pages: 481 to 488. In these, the next number with a 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within 488. So, that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but wait, 480 is included, so 480 has a 4 in the tens place, but in the units place, the last 4 would be 484. Let me recount: From 1-488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many terms, the nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. Okay, so units place 4's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit from the right. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers have 4 in the tens place. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 10*5=50. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets of 10 numbers, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which is the third digit from the right. This happens in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me compute that: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers end with 8 from 1 to 488? Let's see. The first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. So, the nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 numbers. So, units place 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. Wait, 480-488: how many numbers? 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. Because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs only 9 times, not 10. So, total tens place 8's: 10 (from 0-399) +9=19.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 0-99: 10 numbers. 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10. That's 4 sets of 10, totaling 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 400-488 would have 10 numbers, but it's actually 9 because 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,...,488: 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. For each hundred before 400, the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times. So, 0-399: 4 sets of 10, so 40. Then, 400-488: the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place. But wait, the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, and 1,2,3 for pages 100-399. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's:0.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units + tens + hundreds =49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89:10. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is98. So, how many more 4's than 8's? 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place:49. Correct, as 4,14,...,484:49 numbers.\n- Tens place:50. Because from 0-488, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place, except the last hundred (400-488) has 10 numbers (440-449). So, 5 sets of 10, totaling 50.\n- Hundreds place:89. Because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with 4 in hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49. Correct, as 8,18,...,488:49 numbers.\n- Tens place:49. As calculated above.\n- Hundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the hundreds place for 4's is 89, which seems high. Let me think: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488-400+1=89.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? The last number is 488, which ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, 48 times. But wait, actually, from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 fours in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, there's no 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. But wait, let me check the last hundred. The last hundred is 400-488. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct, 4 full hundreds each contributing 10 fours. So, tens place 4's: 40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 40 + 89 = 177. Wait, let me add that again. 48 + 40 is 88, plus 89 is 177. So, 177 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles. The last 8 in the units place is 488. So, 48 numbers have 8 in the units place. So, units place 8's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place appear in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. So, how many such ranges? Let's see, from 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place 8's:49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total 4's:177, total 8's:97. The difference is 177 - 97 = 80. Wait, 177-97: 177-90=87, then minus 7 more is 80. So, 80 more 4's than 8's. Let me just double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units:48, Tens:40, Hundreds:89. 48+40=88, +89=177. That seems right. For 8's: Units:48, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 48+49=97. Yes, that seems correct. So, 177-97=80. Therefore, there are 80 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 40 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 340-349).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 40 + 89 = 177.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 177 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 80.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{80}"

    "text": " Let's see. The first occurrence is at 4, and the last occurrence in the units place would be 484, which is the 484th page. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10 pages, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does the 488th page have a 4 in the units place? 488 is 4 in the hundreds place, 8 in the tens, and 8 in the units. So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 484th page. So, from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 + 1 = 481 pages, but that seems too high. Wait, no, that approach is incorrect. The correct way is to consider how many times 4 appears in the units place. Every 10 pages, it appears once. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the number of times 4 is in the units digit. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but does the 488th page add another 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with 8, not 4. So, it's 48 times. Wait, but let's check: from 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens digit. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are up to 488. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, totaling 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, all these ranges are within 488. Therefore, 5 ranges \u00d710=50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, but I'm only counting the digit 4 in the hundreds place, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, we'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? It's floor(488 /10)=48. But wait, let's check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets. So, 48 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many ranges are there?\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last one contributes 9. So total in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=40+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=48+49=97.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total 4's:187, total 8's:97. So, 187-97=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units:48\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:48\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:48+49=97.\n\nDifference:187-97=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, we had 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 400-488:89 numbers, each contributing one 4.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 pages. From 1 to 488, there are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages in each range (40-49, 140-149, etc.), totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 pages, totaling 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages in each range (80-89, 180-189, etc.), with the last range (480-488) contributing 9 occurrences, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no 8's in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the total number of page numbers divided by 10, but since 488 isn't a multiple of 10, I need to check if 488 is beyond the last multiple of 10. The last multiple of 10 before 488 is 480. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480/10 = 48 occurrences. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, it's 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 ends with an 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 8's. Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th term because (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, yes, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences. Let's count the blocks: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, so 4*10=40. Now, check if 480-488 includes any 8 in the tens place. The tens digit here is 8 only from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. Wait, no, 480-489 is the next block, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's an additional 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought the blocks were 80-89, etc., each giving 10. But in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit can be 8 as well, from 480-488. So, I think I need to include that. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) giving 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Wait, that can't be right because 49+49=98, but let me double-check. Units:49, Tens:49, so total 98 8's. Wait, but earlier when counting 4's, I had 187, and 8's as 98. So, the difference would be 187-98=89. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 8's. Let me recount the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. Units place: 49, Tens place:49, so total 98 8's. So, 4's:187, 8's:98. Difference:187-98=89. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me recount the units place for 8's. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The nth term is given by 8 + (n-1)*10 =488. So, (n-1)*10=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 terms, correct. For the tens place, as above, 49. So, total 98 8's. Now, for 4's, let me check again. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? 484 is the last term. So, 4 + (n-1)*10=484. So, (n-1)*10=480, n-1=48, n=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Wait, but 484 is the 49th term? Wait, 4,14,...,484. Let me list a few: 4 (1),14(2),...,484 would be the 49th term because (484-4)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. So, units place for 4's:49, not 48 as I initially thought. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, units place for 4's:49. Tens place:50. Hundreds place:89. So total 4's:49+50+89=188. Wait, but earlier I thought units place for 4's was 48, but now I'm seeing it's 49. Let me check again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first is 4, then 14,24,...,484. So, the last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10=484. So, (n-1)*10=480, so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 times. So, I was wrong earlier; it's 49, not 48. So, units place for 4's:49. Then, tens place:50, as before. Hundreds place:89. So total 4's:49+50+89=188. Now, 8's:98. So, difference:188-98=90. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier in counting the units place for 4's as 48 instead of 49. So, the correct total for 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Let me verify this again. Units place for 4's:49, Tens place:50, Hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. 8's: Units 49, Tens 49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place, correct. Tens place for 4's:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct. Units place:49. So, total 4's:188. 8's: Units 49, Tens 49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but that was due to an initial mistake in counting the units place for 4's as 48 instead of 49. So, the correct difference is 90. I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, contributing 10 occurrences each, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all page numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, contributing 10 occurrences each for the first four ranges and 9 for 480-488, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, every block of 10 numbers has one such number. So, total number of 4's in the units place would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 times, but wait, 488 is the last page. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the 49th block (481-490), but since the book only goes up to 488, the 49th block would only have 481-488, so 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 484 is the last number ending with 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 numbers, meaning 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let me count again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's the same as the number of times 4 appears in the units place, which is floor(488/10) = 48 times. So, 48 4's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. Starting from 40-49, that's one block. Then 140-149, that's the second, and so on. How many blocks are there? Well, up to 488, the highest block with tens digit 4 is 440-449. So, that's five blocks in total: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4, which occurs from 400-488. So, all numbers from 400 to 488 have a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The last 8 in the units place would be 488. So, 48 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8's in the tens place occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is a partial block because 488 is the last page. Let me count how many full blocks there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. Then 480-488: how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, the number of 8's is 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the partial block, totaling 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488, so yes, 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97 8's in total.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 48+49=97. Correct.\n\nDifference: 187-97=90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one such number. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, and 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does that mean 488 is included? Yes, but 488 doesn't have a 4 in the units place, so it's okay. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, which is 10 numbers. Then from 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's valid. How many blocks is that? From 40-49: 1 block, then 140-149: 2nd block, 240-249: 3rd, 340-349: 4th, and 440-449: 5th. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, that's 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th number in the units place. Let me think again. The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, how many terms are there in the sequence 8, 18, 28,..., 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. Wait, but earlier for 4's, I had 48 in the units place because 484 was the last. But for 8's, 488 is included, so it's 49. Hmm, that seems correct. So, units place: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place. That would be 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many blocks? From 1-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers. Then 180-189: second block, 280-289: third, 380-389: fourth. Now, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of the book. So, 480-489 would be from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so only 480-488 are included. So, does that count as a full block? No, because 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10. So, the tens place 8's would be in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 4 full blocks (each 10 numbers) and one partial block with 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me double-check. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. That's 40. Then 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total 40+9=49. So, tens place: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think again about the units place for 4's. I had 48 numbers, but 488 is the last page. So, does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 8. So, the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is 484. So, from 4 to 484, that's how many numbers? Let me calculate: The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Wait, but 484 is the 49th term. But earlier I thought units place for 4's was 48. Wait, that's a mistake. Let me correct that. If the nth term is 484, then n=49, so there are 49 numbers with 4 in the units place. So, I was wrong earlier. I thought 48, but it's actually 49. So, units place for 4's: 49. Then, tens place: 50, hundreds place:89. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Similarly, for 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, so I made a mistake earlier by one. Let me check again. Units place for 4's: from 4,14,24,...,484. The last term is 484, which is the 49th term because 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, units place for 4's:49. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, the answer should be 90. I think I made a mistake earlier by not including the 484 as the 49th term, so units place for 4's is 49, not 48. So, the correct difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 4, common difference 10, and last term 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This range has 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The sequence has ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 40, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a count, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), does 484 fall within that? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last one would be 440-449, and then 480-488, but 480-488 is part of the hundreds place as well. Let me count each block. Each block is 100 numbers, and in each block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5\u00d710=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98; 98+89=187. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so does 488 count? Yes, because 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each block. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) -97 (number of 8's) =90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units=48, tens=49, hundreds=0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90.

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. The first such number is 4, and the last is 484. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find the count, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. The common difference here is 10. The first term a1 = 4, the last term an = 484. The formula is an = a1 + (n-1)d, where d=10. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n=49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many numbers have 4 in the tens place. From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). How many hundreds do we have? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is only 88 numbers, so the tens digit from 400-488 is 4 for 40-49 in each hundred. Let me calculate: In 1-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. In 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. In 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. In 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. In 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, totaling 5*10=50. Wait, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for page numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the counts for each place: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence formula: a1=8, an=488, d=10. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place as in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many such numbers. From 1-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: Now, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, let me check: 480 is the first, 488 is the last. So from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, adding up: 10 (from 1-99) +10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488) = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the counts for each place: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in sequences like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in sequences like 80-89, 180-189, etc., but from 400-488, it only appears 9 times (480-488). Totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. The first occurrence is 4, and the last is 484. So, how many numbers is that? Well, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10 each time. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but wait a second. The book only goes up to 488, so 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each set of ten pages contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. So, from 40-49: 10 times. Then, from 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, how many sets are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. Pages from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many times. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the book. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in pages 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last set being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, it's 48 times. Wait, but wait a second. Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many terms are there here? The first term is 4, and the last term less than or equal to 488 is 484. The common difference is 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, actually, it's 49 times. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, the correct count is 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, starting from 40-49, that's one range, then 140-149, another, and so on. How many complete hundreds are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these hundreds has a 40-49 range, contributing 10 each. So, 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 40 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, only the hundreds digit is 4, so how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but actually, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. So, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many times. The last number is 488, so the last occurrence is 488. The first term is 8, last term is 488, common difference 10. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there in 488? From 1-488, the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 178 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let's see. The first occurrence is at 4, and the last one before 488 would be 484. To find how many, I can calculate the number of terms in this sequence. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The difference between each term is 10, so it's an arithmetic sequence with first term a=4, common difference d=10, and last term l=484. The formula for the nth term is a + (n-1)d = l. Plugging in the values: 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. Subtract 4: (n-1)*10 = 480. Divide by 10: n-1 = 48. So, n=49. So, there are 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4, which happens in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, there are 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many terms. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence approach: a=8, d=10, l=488. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Subtract 8: (n-1)*10 = 480. Divide by 10: n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, the first four ranges contribute 4*10=40, and the last range contributes 9. So total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484\n   - This sequence has 49 terms.\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges.\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Ranges: 400-488\n   - There are 89 numbers in this range.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488\n   - This sequence has 49 terms.\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488\n   - First four ranges contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and the last range contributes 9 numbers.\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. The first such number is 4, and the last is 484. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Here, a_1 = 4, d = 10, a_n = 484. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1 = 48 => n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 488. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (40-49). From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is within 400-488. Wait, actually, 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 450-488 doesn't have a 4 in the tens place. So, that's 5 blocks of 10, so 5*10=50 occurrences.

So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence formula: a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 488 - 8 = 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, since the book goes up to 488, 480-489 would be beyond 488, so we only go up to 488. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, but the units digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more. So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, for the 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 8's:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. When I considered the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So that's correct. Units place for 8's: 8,18,...,488. How many terms? Let's see, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (n-1)*10=480, so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 terms, correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. 484 is 4 + (n-1)*10=484 => (n-1)*10=480 => n=49. So, 49 4's in units. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks: 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in tens. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as 800-899 exceeds 488 \u2192 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, total 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 full sets of 10 pages and then 8 more pages. So, the 48th set ends at page 480, and then pages 481-488 are the next set. In the units place, 480 + 4 is 484, which is within 488, so that's another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is 48 full groups (from 1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the 484 which is in the 481-488 range, so that's one more, making it 49. Okay, so 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. I'll go through each digit place again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's similar to the 4's. The number of complete groups of 10 is 48, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group, 481-488, we have 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (since 480-488 is part of the book). Let's count these ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, each of the first four ranges contributes 10, and the last one contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (48 full groups of 10 plus one in 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, contributing 10 per range, totaling 50 times (five ranges).\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 times.\n  \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (48 full groups plus one in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, contributing 10 per range, totaling 49 times (four full ranges plus 480-488 contributing 9).\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? The last number with 4 in the units place before 488 is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count them: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 times. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, but let me double-check. Units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the units digit is 8 in 488. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97 times. Wait, that seems off because 48 + 49 is 97, but let me check again. Units: 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 times. Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4\u00d710 +9=49. So total 8's are 48+49=97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems a big difference. Let me check my calculations again. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds place for 4's is from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, correct. Because 488 - 400 +1 =89. So that's correct. For the tens place of 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 50. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 48 times. So, 187 total 4's. For 8's: units place is correct at 48. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Wait, but I'm wondering if I counted correctly. Let me think about another approach. Maybe using the formula for digit counting. For each digit position, calculate the number of times the digit appears. For units place: For any digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to n is floor(n/10)*1 + min(max(n%10 -d +1, 0), 1). Wait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, for each position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated by considering higher digits and lower digits. But perhaps it's easier to stick with my initial method. Alternatively, maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position again to verify. Let's try that. **Counting 4's:**\n\n- **Units place:** The 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the number of complete decades (488 /10 =48.8, so 48 times) plus if the last partial decade has a 4. The last number is 488, which ends with 8, so no extra. So, 48 times.\n\n- **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers. So, 5 ranges \u00d710=50.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n- **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. 488/10=48.8, so 48 times. The last number is 488, which has an 8 in units, so that's included.\n\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last one has 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** As before, no 8's in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's:48+49=97.\n\nSo, the difference is 187-97=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcounting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, that's correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about how many numbers have 4 in each position. For example, in the units place, as I did, 48 times. Similarly, for the tens place, 50 times. For the hundreds place, 89 times. So, 187 total.\n\nFor 8's, units place:48, tens place:49, so 97 total.\n\nSo, 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for 4's, I included 440-449, which is within 488, so that's correct. Similarly, for 8's, I included 480-488, which is correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 187, and the digit 8 appears 97 times. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. The first such number is 4, and the last is 484. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms. Here, a_1 = 4, d = 10, a_n = 484. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 484 - 4 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but does 484 count as the 49th term? Let me check: 4 + (49-1)*10 = 4 + 480 = 484, yes. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, and then 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, we'll have to adjust. Let's see, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place. Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4. From 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, 10. From 300-399: 340-349, 10. From 400-488: 440-449 and 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers. Wait, so from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in two blocks: 440-449 (10 numbers) and 480-488 (9 numbers). So total in the hundreds place for 4 in the tens digit is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me double-check. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10. 100-199: 140-149 is 10. 200-299: 240-249 is 10. 300-399: 340-349 is 10. 400-488: 440-449 is 10, and 480-488 is 9, so total 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +9? Wait, no, that's 5 blocks. Wait, no, from 0-99 is one block, then each hundred after that. So, 0-99: 10. 100-199:10. 200-299:10. 300-399:10. 400-488: 440-449 is 10, and 480-488 is 9, so total in 400-488 is 19. So total 10+10+10+10+19=59? Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think differently. Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.) has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49:10. 100-199:140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488: Now, the tens digit is 4 in two places: 440-449 (10 numbers) and 480-488 (9 numbers). So, total in 400-488:19. So total tens digit 4's:10+10+10+10+19=59. Hmm, but wait, the 480-488 is part of the 400-488 block, right? So, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 59. So, that's 59 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (59) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 59 = 108; 108 +89=197. So, total 4's:197. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers are there? The sequence starts at 8 and ends at 488, with a common difference of 10. So, the nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488. Let's solve for n: 8 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u219210(n-1) \u2264480 \u2192n-1 \u226448 \u2192n\u226449. So, n=49. So, there are 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place. These occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each block: - 0-99:80-89:10 numbers. - 100-199:180-189:10. - 200-299:280-289:10. - 300-399:380-389:10. - 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488). So, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:197, total 8's:98. The difference is 197 -98=99. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's in the tens place. I thought it was 59, but let me confirm. From 0-99:40-49:10. 100-199:140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10 and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+10+9=59. Yes, that's correct. So, 59 in tens place for 4's. And for 8's, in tens place:10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 4's:49 (units) +59 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=197. 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98. Difference:197-98=99. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 n = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks: 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449, and 480-488.\n   - Total: 10 (0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 19 (400-488) = 59.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488: 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 59 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **197**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks: 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Total: 10 (0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 197 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **99**.\n\n$\\boxed{99}$"

    "text": " Let's see. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last group is 481-490, but 488 is the last page. So, actually, the units digit 4 appears in 488 as 8, not 4. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, there are 4 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is 440, 441,...,449. So, that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 5 * 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but 400 is included, so yes, 89 numbers. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the units digit 8 appears in 488 as well. So, that would be 48 times, but actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 numbers) plus one extra number (488). So, that would be 48 + 1 = 49 times? Wait, no. Let me think. Each 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in 488 numbers, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the number of complete groups of 10, which is floor(488/10) = 48, plus 1 if the last number is >= 488 mod 10. Wait, 488 mod 10 is 8, so yes, the 49th occurrence is in 488. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4*10=40, plus the last block 480-488 contributing 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=187-98=89. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, that's correct. Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. Now, for the tens place of 4's: I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. That seems correct. Units place for 4's: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 48 full groups (since 488/10=48.8), so 48 times. So, 48 4's in units place. So, total 4's: 48+50+89=187. For 8's: units place: 49 times, tens place: 49 times, hundreds place: 0. So, 98 total. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for units place, 48 full groups plus one more in 488, so 49. So, 49+49=98. Yeah, that seems right. So, the difference is 187-98=89. So, the answer is 89.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Let's see. The first occurrence is 4, and the last occurrence would be the largest number less than or equal to 488 where the units digit is 4. That would be 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Let's count each block. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Let's count: 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Wait, but wait. Let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Let's calculate. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in each of these 89 numbers, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so that's included. So, how many numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check each block. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book only goes up to 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, let's count: 80-89: 10. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 380-389, each have 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, checking the 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer would be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. That's correct. And in the tens place, for 4's, I had 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. Units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,...,484. How many terms? (484-4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Now, for 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but wait a second. Let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, yes, 188 total 4's and 98 total 8's, so the difference is 90.

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one number ending with 4. So, the total number of such blocks is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, the last block might not be complete. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last complete block is 480-488, which includes 484. So, actually, there are 49 numbers ending with 4. Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the first number ending with 4 is 4, then 14, ..., up to 484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term can be expressed as 10n - 6. Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate it as (488 + 1) / 10, but taking the floor. Wait, actually, the number of times a digit appears in the units place is floor((N + 9) / 10), where N is the total number of pages. So, for 488, that would be floor((488 + 9)/10) = floor(497/10) = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Let's see, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, from 1-100, there's one block (40-49), from 101-200, another block (140-149), and so on. Since 488 is less than 500, we can see how many full hundreds there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes one block of 10 numbers with the tens digit as 4, so that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Using the same formula as before, floor((488 + 9)/10) = floor(497/10) = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8's in the tens place occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Let's calculate how many full blocks there are. From 1-400, how many full blocks of 100 are there? 400/100 = 4. So, in each 100, there's one block of 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be the total number of such blocks. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 488th page, the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within the 480-489 range. So, 48 times? Wait, but 488 is included, so maybe I should check. Let me think: from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place would be the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and we take the floor of that, which is 48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, 40-49 is one block. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So, that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me check the last block. 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 400 is included, so from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Similar to the 4's, it's the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48. So, 48 8's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, 80-89 is one block (80-89), then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another block, but 488 is within that, so that's the fifth block? Wait, no, because 480-489 is within 1-488. So, how many blocks? Let me list them: 80-89 (1 block), 180-189 (2), 280-289 (3), 380-389 (4), and 480-489 (5). But wait, 480-489 is up to 489, but our book ends at 488, so the 480-488 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, so in the tens place, the 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's five blocks, but the last block has only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, how many 8's in the tens place? For the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 8's. The fifth block, 480-488, contributes 9 8's because 488 is the last page. So, total 8's in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 48 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 times (e.g., 400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 48 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 times.\n   - **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n3. **Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles and then 8 extra numbers. In each full cycle, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so the 4 appears once more (484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, the number of numbers is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book goes only up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each full block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 8's, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counting because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the 4's: Units place: 49. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Now, 8's: Units place: 49. Tens place: 49. Hundreds place: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I counted the hundreds place correctly for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's. That seems correct. For the 8's, in the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is the last page. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49. Units place: 49. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me try another approach to verify. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For 4's: Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, which is another 4, so 49. Tens place: every 100 numbers, there's a block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, 488 / 100 = 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, but wait, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles again. Wait, actually, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50. Hundreds place: as before, 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: Units place: same as before, 49. Tens place: in each 100 numbers, there's a block of 10 where the tens digit is 8. So, 488 / 100 = 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n     - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n     - Total cycles of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full cycles (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n     - Each full cycle contributes 1 '4', so 48 times.\n     - In the remaining 8 numbers, 484 contributes another '4'.\n     - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n     - Each block contributes 10 '4's.\n     - There are 5 such blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n     - **Total in tens place:** 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488.\n     - Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n     - Similar to '4's, the digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - Total cycles: 48 full cycles (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n     - Each full cycle contributes 1 '8', so 48 times.\n     - In the remaining 8 numbers, 488 contributes another '8'.\n     - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n     - Each block contributes 10 '8's.\n     - There are 4 full blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and a partial block from 400-488 (480-488).\n     - Full blocks: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - Partial block: 480-488 is 9 numbers, contributing 9 '8's.\n     - **Total in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a number, it's 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does the 488 include a 4 in the units place? Let me check. The last number is 488, so the last units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, from 4, 14, ..., 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, that's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. Because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles and then a partial cycle. But in the partial cycle, we have 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in the units place, 4 appears once more at 484, making it 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long. Let's count how many such ranges there are up to 488. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's 50 times. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, but let me check. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many times this happens. The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, starting from 8, each step of 10. So, the number of times is (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count the ranges. From 0-99: 80-89. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so it's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's: units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. 49+49=98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the total number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. However, wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? Let's check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last complete group ends at 480, which is 48 times. But wait, 484 is within 488, so actually, it's 48 times because 484 is the 48th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many full decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490). But wait, 488 is less than 490, so the last decade is 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so the units digit 4 appears once in each decade. So, 48 decades mean 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is 488, which is 4 in the hundreds place, 8 in the tens, and 8 in the units. So, the units digit 4 appears 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such groups are there? Each hundred has a group where the tens digit is 4. From 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). So that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, 488 is less than 490, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's okay. So, total 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. So, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so the units digit 8 appears in 488, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, but let's see: from 1-488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place, which is 48 times. Because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, the last group is 480-488. How many groups? Each hundred has a group where the tens digit is 8. From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last). So, the first four groups have 10 each, and the last group has 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. So, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98+89=187. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, that's correct. But let me think again about the tens place for 4's. When counting the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 groups, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50 times. That seems right. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Units place: 48 times. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's: units 48 times, tens 49 times, so 97. So, 187-97=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such groups, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 48 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The first four groups contribute 10 each, and the last group (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 (units) + 49 (tens) = **97**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, total number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears in the units digit. That would be the floor of 488 divided by 10, which is 48, plus one if the last number is a 4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But 488's units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, 48 times. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, the first four blocks (1-399) each have 10 numbers with tens digit 4. The last block, 400-488, has how many? From 400-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is fully included. So, that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 10 from 400-488, totaling 50. Wait, no, wait. Actually, from 1-399, each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, 1-99: 10 numbers (40-49), 100-199: 100-149? Wait, no, 100-199: the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers. Then, 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10, totaling 40. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 50. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount. 1-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149: 10. 200-299: 240-249: 10. 300-399: 340-349: 10. 400-488: 440-449: 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, but 440-449 is within that, so yes, 10 numbers. So, 50 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 +89=187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. So, 48 +50=98, 98+89=187. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 times. Wait, 8,18,...,488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Let's count these. From 1-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389:10. 400-488: 480-488: how many? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89. Wait, that's a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: from 4,14,...,484. 484 is 48*10 +4, so 48 times. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's: units place:8,18,...,488:49 times. Tens place:80-89,180-189,...,480-488:10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place:0. So, 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Total: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   Total: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in numbers 400-488.  \n   Total: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\) times.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n\\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\) times.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Total: \\( \\left\\lceil \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rceil = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   Total: 4 full blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 (for 480-488) = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear as the hundreds digit (pages only go up to 488).  \n   Total: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n\\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\) times.\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's like every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? Let me check. 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, from 4 to 484, that's 48 times. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay. Let me count how many such groups there are. Each group is 10 numbers, so for each hundred, there's a group where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers)  \n100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers)  \n200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers)  \n300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers)  \n400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is less than 499, so it's okay). So that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only interested in the hundreds digit being 4, which is true for all numbers from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but let's check if 488 is included. 488 ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th number ending with 8. Let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The first is 8 (1), then 18 (2), ..., up to 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many such groups there are. Each group is 10 numbers, so for each hundred, there's a group where the tens digit is 8. So, from 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers)  \n100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers)  \n200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers)  \n300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers)  \n400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full groups (each contributing 10) and one partial group contributing 9. So, total tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.

So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49 (first range), then each subsequent hundred: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Let's subtract 400 from 488 and add 1 to include both endpoints. 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 + 1 = 89 numbers. Therefore, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 end with an 8? Yes, 488 is the last page, so it's included. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10 each time. The last such number is 488, which is 8 more than 480. So, 488 is included, so the count is 49? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me think: from 8 to 488, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can only be 8 if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 such occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. This gives 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. The first such number is 4, and the last is 484. To find how many there are, I can use the formula: (Last - First) / Interval + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, let me check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes, that's right. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. First is 8, last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's, but the last block (480-488) is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, for the first four blocks: 4 * 10 = 40. The last block: 9 numbers, so 9 8's. Total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, there's exactly one number ending with 4. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In those extra numbers, 484 is the only one ending with 4. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, that makes sense. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place as well. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a 40-49 range. Let's see: 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers), 101-200: 140-149 (10), 201-300: 240-249 (10), 301-400: 340-349 (10), and 401-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 401-488 only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within that range. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, giving 5*10 = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last, so that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 48 full decades (1-480) give 48 4's, and then in 481-488, 484 is the only one, so 49 total. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and there are 5 hundreds (1-5), so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 ends with 8, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, each of the first four ranges gives 10 8's in the tens place, and the last range gives 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of those, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (48 full decades plus one in 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range (480-488) contributing 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
