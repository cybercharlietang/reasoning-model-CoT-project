    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have tens digit 8? Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks we have. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) and 9 from 400-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\( \\frac{484}{10} + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Total blocks contributing: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\)\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n\\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\)\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\( \\frac{488}{10} + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9.  \n   - Total blocks contributing: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 from 480-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 0\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n\\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\)\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\)\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but wait: from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Let's think differently. The numbers are 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would go beyond 488, so only up to 488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be the next set, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, does that matter? Because in the tens place, 480-489 all have 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought units and tens each had 49, so total 98. But let me double-check the tens place. When I considered the tens place, I thought that 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so that's correct. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 in the tens place. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each place again for both digits. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, step 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, so 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, difference:188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, ..., up to 488. So yes, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but the last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th number. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be next, but the book only goes up to 488, so in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) contributes 10, but the last set (480-488) contributes 9. So total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks are within 488. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488 gives 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that seems off because when I added up, units was 49, tens was 49, so total 98. But let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that's a big difference. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check my counts again. For 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again about the units place for 4's. When I counted units place for 4's, I went up to 484, which is the 49th occurrence. But 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place before 488. So, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for 8's, units place goes up to 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, that's correct. Tens place for 4's: from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50. That's correct. For 8's, tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488, which is 5 sets but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. Hundreds place for 8's: none, correct. So, total 4's:188, 8's:98, difference:90. So, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks up to 440-449.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but wait, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's correct. So total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, moving on to count the number of 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in units place? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. Let's calculate how many. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be next, but the book only goes up to 488. So, let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. So total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the ranges. Let me recount the 4's and 8's. For 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. So, (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, every 10th number up to 488. The total count would be (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488 (9 numbers because 488 is the last page). Wait, so for the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) each have 10, and the last block has 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but let me check the last number. The last number with 8 in units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is within 488, so yes, it's included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so yes, 9. So total tens place eights: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, did I count the hundreds place correctly? Let me check the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. For eights, hundreds place is 0 because 800 is beyond 488. Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many terms? From 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different counting method. Alternatively, for each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. Let's try that.\n\nFor units digit: in numbers 1-488, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last set. For units digit, the number of times a digit d appears is floor(488/10) + (1 if the remainder is >=d else 0). So, for 4: floor(488/10)=48, remainder 8. Since 8>=4, so 48+1=49 fours in units place. Similarly, for 8: floor(488/10)=48, remainder 8. Since 8>=8, so 48+1=49 eights in units place. So, same as before.\n\nFor tens digit: each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for tens digit, the number of times a digit d appears is floor(488/100)*10 + extra. Let's see, 488/100=4.88, so floor is 4, so 4*10=40. Now, the extra comes from the last partial hundred. The last partial hundred is 400-488. The tens digit in this partial hundred goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 400-488? From 400-409: 10 times, 410-419: 10 times, ..., 480-488:9 times. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the tens digit in 400-488 can be 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., 8 (480-488). So, for each digit d from 0 to 8, the number of times d appears in the tens place is 10 for d=0 (400-409), but wait, no. Wait, 400-409: tens digit is 0, so 10 numbers. 410-419: tens digit 1, 10 numbers. Similarly, up to 480-488: tens digit 8, 9 numbers. So, for the tens digit in 400-488, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, the extra for digit 4 in tens place is 10. So, total fours in tens place: 4*10 +10=50. Similarly, for digit 8 in tens place: in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, extra for 8 is 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. That matches our earlier count.\n\nFor hundreds digit: For 4, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For 8, it's 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours is 89, but when I think about it, 400-488 is indeed 89 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my initial calculation was correct. The number of fours is 188, the number of eights is 98, so the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 \u00f7 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 \u00f7 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** There are \\boxed{90} more 4's printed than 8's."

Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, how many sets? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot, but let me check again. Wait, when I counted the tens place for 8's, I had 49, but let me make sure. For the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98. For fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, totaling 188. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " The hundreds digit is 4 for 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488 inclusive. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last one is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, that's (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8? Let me see: 480-489 would be the tens digit 8, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, how many numbers in the tens place have 8? Each hundred block (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers.

Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90. But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's. For 4's: Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, so 48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each hundred has 10, and from 400-488, the last set is 440-449, which is 10. So, 5 sets: 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Correct. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Let's see: The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. So, the last one would be 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers, meaning 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, let's count each set. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds:89, total 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks are there up to 488. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is still 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-489 is a full set, but we only go up to 488, so in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9 more in 480-488, so 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, because 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49 eights, tens place: 49 eights, so total 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units place, every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many? Let's calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 has 10 fours in the tens place, so from 1-400, that's 4 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), each contributing 10, so 40. Then 400-488: 440-449 is another 10, so total 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place. So 89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, so 40, and 480-488 contributes 9, so total 49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 for each number from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences. Because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would be another block, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many such blocks are there? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Let's see, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488-400+1=89. So, total fours in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, but wait, no. Wait, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 4*10 (from 1-400) +10 (from 400-488) = 50. That's correct. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included. Let's see: The first is 8, last is 488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each block of 100 contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 9, not 10. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that can't be right because when I subtract 98 from 188, I get 90. But let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. But wait, does 400 count as one? Yes, because 400 is page 400, which has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 9, not 10. So, total tens place eights: 4*10=40 (from 1-400) +9=49. Correct. Units place eights: 49. So, total eights:98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm thinking that 488 is the last page, so when counting units place eights, does 488 count as one? Yes, because 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, units place eights: 8,18,...,488. That's (488-8)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly, tens place eights: 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is included. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. When I count the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. Let me count how many. The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. So, 88 is the 9th occurrence, 188 is the 19th, and so on. Alternatively, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one.

    "text": " The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many full sets we have. Each set is 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check the counting for the tens place of 8's. When I considered 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all of them, which is 9 eights. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, which is 49 numbers. So, 49 + 50 (tens) +89=188. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but let me check again. When counting the units place for 4's, I thought of 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=49. Correct. For 4's in tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each gives 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Correct. For 8's in tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four gives 10, the last gives 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Hundreds place for 8's: none, since 800>488. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90.

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. So, 484 is the 49th number because (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So that's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-4, so 40-49 is in 0-99, then 140-149 in 100-199, etc.), so 5*10=50. That's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that set. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, which gives 48 eights. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. Wait, no, because 8 is the 1st, 18 is the 2nd, ..., 488 is the (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1= 48 +1=49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is valid. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, total is 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but does 480-489 have 10 numbers? But since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, the tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, seems right.

Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens places with 8: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds places with 8.

Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence. The first term a1 = 8, common difference d = 10. The nth term is a_n = a1 + (n-1)*d. We want a_n = 488. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49.

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total. Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so that's correct. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would have the tens digit as 8. Let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours are 188, eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because 188 seems high for fours. Let me recount the fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 10(n-1)+4=484. So, 10(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 fours in units.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours in tens.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 8,18,...,488. The nth term is 10(n-1)+8=488. So, 10(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 eights in units.\n\n- Tens: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9).\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 4 up to 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8 up to 488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last range contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, so this contributes 0.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but let me check: from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The formula is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full block (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 eights. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, the tens place contributes 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights. Wait, no: 80-89 is one set, 180-189 another, 280-289 another, 380-389 another, and 480-488 is the fifth set but only 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for fours and eights. For fours in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. That seems right. For eights in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10, with the last block contributing 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 fours, but wait, 488 is included, so the 48th ten would end at 480, and then 481-488 would have 484 as the next 4 in units place. So, that would be 49 fours in units place, as I thought earlier. Tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and there are 4 hundreds (1-400, 401-800, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds go up to 4. So, 400-488 is the last set, which is 440-449, right? Wait, no. Let me think again. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 eights, but since 488 is included, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, each of these blocks has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 188 - 98 is 90? Let me check the subtraction: 188 minus 98. 188 - 90 is 98, then subtract 8 more: 98 - 8 = 90. Yes, that's correct.

So, in the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers.

    "text": " The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, let me double-check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, so 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units place: from 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And for the tens place, 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. Units place, 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But let me think again. Another way to count the number of 4's and 8's is to consider each digit position separately, as I did, but perhaps I missed something. Let me recount the eights in the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 full decades (each contributing 10) and one partial decade (480-488:9). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: same as before, 49. So, total 98 eights. Fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as pages don't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484: that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. Thus, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 eights, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. Let me confirm: starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more, so up to 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except possibly the last block. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like that might not be right. Let me check the tens place for eights again. When counting the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40+9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, I had 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, which is 5 blocks of 10, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. For the hundreds place in fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, that's correct. And each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Similarly, in the tens place for fours, we have 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Units place for fours:49. So, total fours:188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. Wait, but I just thought, maybe I made a mistake in the units place for fours. Let me check again. Units place for fours: starting at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms is that? The sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) \u2264488. So, 10*(n-1) \u2264484, so n-1 \u226448.4, so n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. That's correct. Similarly, for eights in units place:8,18,...,488. Same logic: 49 terms. So, that's correct. So, I think my calculation is correct, and the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Wait, but does that include 400? Yes, because 400 is the first number with 4 in the hundreds place. So, total fours in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but let me check if 488 is included. 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, 8,18,...,488 is 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Yes, that's correct. And for eights in the tens place, I had 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. So, 5 sets, but the last set has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct.

Yes, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers.

Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 exist? Since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, let's calculate that: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) give 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.

Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, that set is only up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of eights is 98.

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range. So, how many tens places have 8? Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). Wait, no, wait. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, for the hundreds block 400-499, the 8 in tens place occurs 9 times instead of 10. So, total tens places with 8: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the units place again for 4's: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + 10(n-1) = 484. So, 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. For tens place, 40-49,140-149, etc., each block of 100 has 10 fours in the tens place. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now for 8's: units place, 8,18,...,488. Same as fours: 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

But the book goes only up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except maybe the last block. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 = 9). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488.

So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place.
