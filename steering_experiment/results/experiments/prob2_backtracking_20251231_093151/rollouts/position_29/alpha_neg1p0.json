    "text": " 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188? Hmm, but let me check again. Wait, 49 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th number because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be next, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's see: Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) give 4 sets \u00d710 =40 eights in the tens place. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So total in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, so fours are 188 and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my counts because that seems like a big difference. Let me go through the fours again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The formula is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The last number is 488, which is 8 +10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9, totaling 49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Let's calculate: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10 +10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is the last page, 488 itself is 488, which ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So units place is 49. Tens place: as above, 10 per hundred, and we have 4 hundreds: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.

How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, the last 8 is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page. So, each block except the last has 10 numbers. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

The book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the tens place. So, how many sets? Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.

Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. So 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. Let's check how many terms: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear (pages go up to 488). This is 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) has 9. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, I subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, so I can calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48 full decades, which gives 48 eights. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me think: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So starting from 8, each 10 numbers, so 488 is the 49th occurrence because (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each full set (e.g., 80-89) has 10 numbers, so 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is 488, which is 8 in the units place, so yes, 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks are there. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights. That's 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 =90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would be 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, does 488 include 484 as the last one? Yes, so from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears 49 times because 484 is the 49th occurrence. So units: 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. There are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens digit 4 occurs from 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights. But wait, does 488 count as an extra? 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, yes, 9. So total tens place eights: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10*4 +9=49. So total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.

Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188? Hmm, that seems high. Wait, let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes, that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488.

Wait, 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. Yes, that's 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that's a big difference. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many terms, it's (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens place, 4's: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 10 each, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the last, which is 488-8=480, 480/10=48, +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. Total 49. Correct.

Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Since 488 ends with 8, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488.

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. How many numbers is that? Let's divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. So, taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is 48*10 + 8, it's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the fours: Units: 4,14,...484. From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens: Each hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. From 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units: 8,18,...488. That's 488//10=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. Correct. Tens: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Number of occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in page numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in the range 800-899 exist, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, but wait, does that make sense? Let me think. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let me think differently. For each digit place, we can calculate the number of times 4 appears.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recalculate.\n\nUnits place: For each complete set of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0-9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But then, in the incomplete set from 481-488, the units digit goes from 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, units place has 48 fours, not 49. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me confirm. For example, from 1-40, the units digit 4 appears at 4,14,24,34,44. That's 4 fours up to 44. Then, 45-49 don't add any more units digit fours. Wait, no, 44 is the 4th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so up to 488, the units digit 4 appears at 4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94,104,114,...,484. So, how many such numbers? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1 = 48+1=49. So, that's 49 fours in the units place. So, maybe my initial thought was correct, and the units place has 49 fours. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets?\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place has 0 eights.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, we had 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 4's from 400-488: that's 89 numbers, as 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 10 numbers per hundred, totaling 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 10 numbers per hundred, with an additional 9 in the last partial set (480-488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included. So, starting from 8, the next is 18, ..., 488. So, how many numbers? From 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Let me solve for n: 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in all these, so that's 9 numbers. So total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount. For eights in the tens place: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. For fours in the tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So 5*10=50. That's correct. And hundreds place for fours: 400-488:89 numbers. That's correct. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.

    "text": " Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part gives 48, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, the book ends at 488, so 380-389 is within range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so the last set is 380-389. Each of these sets has 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10. That's 4 sets, so 40 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, 8 appears 89 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 89 (number of 8's) equals 99.

Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49.

So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49.

Now, the last block is 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place here.

Wait, let me check that addition again. 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Starting at 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last one. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total is 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, let me check: 49 +49 is 98. So, total 8's are 98.

Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for fours, I considered 440-449 as 10 numbers, which is correct. And for eights in the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That adds up to 49, which is correct. So, 98 eights and 188 fours. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount. Let me check another way. Alternatively, I could think of each digit place separately and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place. For units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, which would give 48 fours and 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the last number, so the 49th occurrence for both. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights. Then, tens place: For fours, in each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49, etc.). Since we have 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 hundreds (1-400), but wait, 400 is the start of the 400s, so let me think. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500) but since we only go up to 488, the last block is 401-488. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? In each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, for the first four hundred blocks (1-400), that's 4 times 10 = 40 fours. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens fours: 40 + 10 = 50. Similarly, for eights in the tens place: in each hundred block, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in 1-400, that's 4 times 10 = 40 eights. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Now, hundreds place: fours appear in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Eights don't appear in hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit is only 4. So, hundreds fours: 89, hundreds eights: 0. Now, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188. Eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 0. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For eights, since 800-899 isn't included, no eights in hundreds place. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, yes, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers; there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers except the last, which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, which gives 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are there within 488. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check again. Fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. Eights: 49 (units) +40 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 89. 188 - 89 = 99.

Wait, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place, which is floor(488/10) = 48 times, but wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, the next set would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers.

    "text": " 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last one. Let's see: From 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189: 10. 201-300: 280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. 401-488:480-488:9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, so 4 hundreds (1-400) would have 4*10=40, but wait, 400 is the end, so 400-488 is part of the 400s. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. That seems correct. For fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: 49 fours, tens:50 fours. So total fours:188. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers.

Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also count? But the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for fours, I considered 440-449 as 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So that's correct. And in the tens place for fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place: 49. So, 188 fours. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

Each hundred has 10 such numbers, so 4 hundreds (1-400) would give 4*10=40, but wait, 400-488 is the last part. Wait, no, 1-488 includes 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, how many have 8 in units place? Let's see: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 more. So total units place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought 488 would be the 49th. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

So, tens place has 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about units place, I thought maybe 49, and tens place also 49, so total 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89 numbers.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. Number of terms: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nThus, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (9 numbers). Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block except the last one has 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This gives 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
