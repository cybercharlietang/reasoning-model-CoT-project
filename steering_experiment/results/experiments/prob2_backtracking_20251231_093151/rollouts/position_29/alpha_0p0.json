    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So total fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, okay, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each block before 400 has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. Let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 fall within the book? Since the book ends at 488, yes, 480-488 is part of the book. So, each of these blocks has 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more fours than eights are printed. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many sets we have. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) which is 4*10=40, plus the last partial block 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Now, let's add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, then every 10 after that. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The last number is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, in the tens place, we have 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4 appears every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then 14, 24,..., 484. So, how many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Total fours: 49 +50 +89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see, up to 488. So, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, from 400-488, we have 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify the hundreds place for fours: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. For eights in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 9 eights there, plus 40 from the earlier blocks, totaling 49. Units place for eights: 49, same as fours. So, the total eights are 98, fours are 188. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, and 488 is the last, so 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

For eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but 480-488 is actually 9 numbers because 480 is the first and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 480 = 8, but adding 1 gives 9. So, that part is correct. Also, for fours in the tens place, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That seems right because 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. And in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so that's 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188.

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 = 9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Yes. And for the tens place in fours, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. That's (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, the total eights are 49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included. So, starting at 8, the last number is 488. So, how many numbers?

So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, the tens place has 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9.

Wait, but does 488 have a hundreds digit of 4? Yes, because 488 is 4 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 8 (units). So, yes, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.

So, 49 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's 90. But let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: 49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Let me check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct. And in the tens place for fours, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place, 49. So, 188 fours. For eights, units place 49, tens place 49, so 98.

Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count how many full blocks we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights. Now, the last set is 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, no. Wait, in the tens place for 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Let me do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me list them: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because starting from 0, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, the numbers 480-488 have an 8 in the tens place. So, how many sets do we have? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens place has 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Wait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98 eights in total. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

Units: 4,14,...,484: That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49, correct. Tens: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50, correct. Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4, so 89, correct. Total fours: 49+50+89=188, correct. Eights: Units:8,18,...,488: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49, correct. Tens:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 4*10 +9=49, correct. Hundreds: none, so total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but wait a second. I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-499, but the book only goes up to 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Now, let me check that again because I think I might have overcounted somewhere. Alternatively, maybe I should use a formula or a more systematic approach. Wait, another way to count digits is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in each position. So, for the units place, as before, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last digit is >=4. Wait, actually, it's (488 // 10) + 1 if 488 % 10 >=4. Let me compute 488 divided by 10: 488//10=48, and 488%10=8, which is >=4, so the number of 4's in the units place is 48 +1=49, which matches what I had before. Similarly, for the tens place: the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, the number of complete hundreds in 488 is 4 (since 4*100=400, and 5*100=500 which is beyond 488). Each hundred contributes 10 times the digit in the tens place. So, for the tens place, the number of 4's is 4*10=40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's an additional 10, making it 40 +10=50. Wait, no, because 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds part is 4, so the tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, for 4 hundreds (1-400), that's 4*10=40. But then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit can be 4 for 10 numbers (440-449), so that's an additional 10, making it 50. So, that's correct. Now, for the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? It's the number of numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)= 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, we add 1, so 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers, except for the last hundred. Let me count: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189:10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)= 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because it's easy to make a mistake here. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me just verify the counts again. Units place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th term, so 49 fours. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term, so 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges is 10 numbers, and the last is 9, so 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, that's 10 +10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98.

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, let's add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check each place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. Let's count how many. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, let's add up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488:89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. So, the total is indeed 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours. Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the units place again. For 4's, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of occurrences is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last number is >=4 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Then, since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (each 10 numbers) plus one if the last number is >=4. Wait, actually, it's better to calculate it as (n + 9 - d) // 10, where d is the digit we're looking for. Alternatively, for units digit 4: the number of times is (488 + 1) // 10 = 48.9, so 48 times? Wait, that doesn't seem right because 488 is the last page, and 488 mod 10 is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? Let me see: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place for 4 is 49. Similarly, for 8 in units place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 mod 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, both units digits have 49 occurrences. That's correct. So, for 4's, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, but let me double-check. From 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many? It's every 10 numbers, so (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 10 each, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, yes, but each of those numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The last number is 488, which is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. So, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the last set. So, each of these blocks has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So that's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit in 400-488 is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 400-488 includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers, but when considering the tens digit, each hundred block (like 400-499) would have 10 numbers with tens digit 4, but since we're stopping at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 400-409: 10 numbers, 410-419:10, 420-429:10, 430-439:10, 440-449:10, 450-459:10, 460-469:10, 470-479:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. Wait, that's 9 sets, but the first 8 sets (400-479) each have 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) has 9. So total in the tens place for 400-488 is 8*10 +9=89. But wait, earlier I thought it was 10 per hundred, but in this case, since the last hundred isn't complete, it's 89. But earlier, I thought that each hundred block contributes 10, but actually, the hundreds block is 400-499, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit in 400-488 would be 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-488. So, from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let me count:\n\n- 400-409: 10 numbers\n- 410-419:10\n- 420-429:10\n- 430-439:10\n- 440-449:10\n- 450-459:10\n- 460-469:10\n- 470-479:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo that's 8 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 89. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, no, in the tens place, 4 appears in 400-488 as follows: each block of 100 contributes 10, but since we're only going up to 488, the last block is incomplete. So, from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let me think differently. The tens digit is 4 when the number is between 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, and 480-488. Wait, no, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, not 4. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So, for the tens digit to be 4, the numbers would be 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and 480-488. Wait, no, 480-488 has a tens digit of 8, not 4. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 8 blocks, totaling 80 numbers. Wait, but 400-409 is 10 numbers, 410-419 is another 10, etc., up to 470-479, which is 8 blocks, so 8*10=80. Then, 480-488 has a tens digit of 8, so no 4's there. So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit is 4 in 80 numbers. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 89. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct this. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in the following ranges:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n- 540-549: but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 540-549 isn't included. So, actually, in the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit can be 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 470-479, which is 8 blocks of 10, so 80 numbers. But that's within the hundreds place, so I think I'm mixing up the hundreds and tens places. Let me clarify:\n\n- Units place: 49 fours\n- Tens place: In each hundred block, 10 numbers have 4 in the tens place. From 1-488, how many complete hundred blocks are there? 4 hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, no, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds blocks are 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundred blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.). So that's 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. Then, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479. Each of these is 10 numbers, but wait, 480-488 has a tens digit of 8, so we don't include that. So, from 400-479, the tens digit is 4 in 8 blocks of 10, which is 80 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 40 (from the first four hundreds) +80 (from 400-479) = 120 fours. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 50. I think I'm getting confused between the tens place and the hundreds place. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider each digit position separately:\n\n**Units place (4's):**\nNumbers ending with 4: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of such numbers is calculated by (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49.\n\n**Tens place (4's):**\nNumbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. But wait, in the range 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 470-479, which is 8 blocks of 10, so 80 numbers. So, total in tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 400-409 (10), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), 450-459 (10), 460-469 (10), 470-479 (10). Wait, that's 12 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 120. But wait, 480-488 is beyond 480, so the tens digit there is 8, not 4. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 120 times.\n\n**Hundreds place (4's):**\nNumbers where the hundreds digit is 4: 400-488. The number of numbers here is 488 - 400 +1 =89.\n\nSo total fours: 49 (units) +120 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =258.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I'm overcounting. For example, in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, 410-419:10, up to 470-479:10. That's 8 blocks, so 80 numbers. Plus, in the earlier hundreds (1-399), the tens digit is 4 in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349. Each is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. So total tens place fours:40+80=120. Units place:49. Hundreds place:89. Total fours:49+120+89=258.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 188, but now I'm getting 258. I must be making a mistake. Let me think differently. Maybe I should use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nAnother way: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 appears.\n\n**Units place:**\nNumbers from 1 to 488. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the incomplete decade.\n\nNumber of complete decades:488 //10 =48. Each contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48.\n\nBut wait, 488//10 is 48, but the last number is 488, which is in the 48th decade (480-489). So, the units digit cycles 48 times, each contributing one 4. But wait, in each decade, 4 appears exactly once in the units place (e.g., 4,14,24,...). So, total units place fours:48. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 4 in units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place:49.\n\n**Tens place:**\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49,140-149, etc.). So, number of hundreds is 488//100=4 (since 4*100=400, and 488<500). So, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. But wait, in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit can be 4 in 400-409,410-419,...,470-479. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 8 blocks (400-409 is the first, up to 470-479). So, 8*10=80. So total tens place fours:40 (from first four hundreds) +80 (from last partial hundred) =120.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\nNumbers where the hundreds digit is 4:400-488. The count is 488-400+1=89.\n\nSo total fours:49 (units) +120 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=258.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 188, but now it's 258. I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me confirm with a smaller example. Suppose the book has 48 pages. How many fours and eights?\n\nUnits place fours:4,14,24,34,44. That's 5 fours.\n\nTens place fours:40-49: but 48 is the last page, so 40-48:9 numbers. Wait, no, 40-48 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, but since the book ends at 48, it's 40-48, which is 9 numbers. So, tens place fours:9.\n\nHundreds place: none, since it's only up to 48.\n\nTotal fours:5+9=14.\n\nEights: units place:8,18,28,38,48:5 eights.\n\nTens place:48:1 eight.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal eights:5+1=6.\n\nSo, fours - eights=14-6=8.\n\nBut if I use the formula above:\n\nUnits place fours:48//10=4, but since 48>=4, units fours=5.\n\nTens place fours:48//100=0, but in 40-48, it's 9. So, total tens fours=9.\n\nHundreds place fours:0.\n\nTotal fours=5+9=14.\n\nSimilarly, eights: units place=5, tens place=1, total=6.\n\nSo, difference=8.\n\nWhich matches manual counting. So, the formula seems to work for the smaller case. Therefore, applying it to 488 pages:\n\nUnits fours:488//10=48, but since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 in units is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units fours=49.\n\nTens fours:488//100=4, so 4*10=40. But in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 400-409,410-419,...,470-479, which is 8 blocks of 10, so 80. So total tens fours=40+80=120.\n\nHundreds fours:488-400+1=89.\n\nTotal fours=49+120+89=258.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n**Units place (8's):**\nNumbers ending with 8:8,18,28,...,488. The number of such numbers is (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49.\n\n**Tens place (8's):**\nNumbers where the tens digit is 8:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 (480-488). So, total tens place eights:4*10 +9=49.\n\n**Hundreds place (8's):**\nNumbers where the hundreds digit is 8:800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nTherefore, the number of fours is 258, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 258 -98=160.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, earlier in the smaller example, the formula worked, so maybe it's correct. But let me think: 258 fours and 98 eights, so 258-98=160 more fours.\n\nBut wait, let me recount the eights to make sure.\n\n**Units place eights:**8,18,28,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The count is (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\n**Tens place eights:**80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers. So total tens eights:4*10 +9=49.\n\n**Hundreds place eights:**None, since 488<800.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, fours:258, eights:98. Difference:258-98=160.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 160, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting fours. Let me recount the fours.\n\n**Units fours:**49.\n\n**Tens fours:**120.\n\n**Hundreds fours:**89.\n\nTotal:49+120=169+89=258.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 258-98=160.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the answer seems quite high. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.

    "text": " 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is the last page, it's included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many full blocks we have. From 1-400, we have 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488). So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. Let me recount that part. When counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has exactly 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct. So, the total eights are 98, fours are 188, so the difference is 90. But wait, I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours was 89, but let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. That's correct. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. Eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the tens and units places, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can count the number of times each digit appears in each position separately, using a more systematic method. For units place: For any digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to n can be calculated as floor(n/10) + (1 if the units digit of n is >=d else 0). Wait, but I think I might have done it correctly before. Alternatively, for each position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated based on higher digits and lower digits. But maybe it's easier to stick with my initial method since it's straightforward. Alternatively, I can list out the counts again. Let me try to recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The sequence starts at 4, ends at 484, with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49:10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, eights. Units place:8,18,28,...,488. The sequence starts at 8, ends at 488, common difference 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: none, since 800>488. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. I think that's correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as page numbers don't reach 800.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, which gives 48 eights. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so 80-89 is okay. Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Wait, but 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, how many sets do we have? Let me see: from 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, how many sets? 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I counted the units place for 4's, I got 49, and for 8's, I also got 49. Let me verify that.\n\nFor units place of 4's: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nFor units place of 8's: from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: none, since 800 is beyond 488.

Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10). Wait, no: from 480 to 489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 eights.

Let me compute that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times that happens. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place.

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And in the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 fours there, making the tens place total 50. Units place, 49 fours. So, 188 fours. For eights, units and tens each have 49, so 98. Therefore, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. But wait, another way to think about it: maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me recount. From page 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages.

I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, so 48 eights. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. From 8 to 488, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. Yes, that's 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89= 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first is 8, and the last is 488. To count how many, I can do 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's 49 times. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10, last set is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the tens and hundreds places, it's easy to miscount. Let me check again. For 4's in the hundreds place: 400-488. That's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. Correct. For the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. For 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, I think my count is accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 5 sets: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four sets: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Last set: 480-488 (9 numbers).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only interested in how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences (since 488 is included). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see if 480-489 is included, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 would be part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 0-100: 80-89 (10), 100-200: 180-189 (10), 200-300: 280-289 (10), 300-400: 380-389 (10). Now, 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, so that's 9 instead of 10. So, total for the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (each contributing 10 eights) and then 9 more in the last partial block. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let me count how many full sets of 100 there are. Each 100 numbers contribute 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 40. Now, in the last set, 480-489, but the book only goes up to 488, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in all these, so that's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

Let me confirm: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So 89 fours there.\n\nUnits place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers, as (488-8)/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: none, so 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when counting the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, so including both endpoints, it's 9 numbers.
