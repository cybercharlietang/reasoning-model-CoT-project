    "text": " 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the last page is 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds an 8 in the units place. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but let me make sure. Each block from 0-99, 100-199, etc., has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, up to 480, we have 4 sets of 10, which is 40, and then from 480-488, that's 9 more, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. That's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, the total fours are 188. For eights, in the tens place, I had 49. Let me recount that. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each full set (e.g., 80-89) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the partial set at 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 in all these, so that's 9 more eights.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let's recount the fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The last one is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 = 4 + 10*(48), so 48+1=49. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th occurrence. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10*4 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. For the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 4 full sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40 and 9, so total 49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place for fours: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. Units place for eights:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. 188-98=90.

From 8 to 488 with a step of 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me make sure. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total is 10*4 +9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's the difference. But wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 49, which included the 480-488 as 9 numbers. So, 49 eights in tens place. Units place: 49 eights. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me think again about the tens place for fours. I had 5 sets of 10: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That's correct. Units place for fours: 49, because from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. So, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90.

But since we include both endpoints, it's 49 numbers. Wait, let me confirm: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

So, adding up: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) gives 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units place:8,18,...,488, which is 49 numbers.

So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counting to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units place up to 484 is correct at 49, tens place: 5 sets of 10, which is 50, and hundreds place from 400-488 is 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units place up to 488 is 49, tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 480-488, which is 9, so 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences for the first four blocks and 9 for the last (480-488).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (as the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Let's divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. When I counted the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, I had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50. That seems correct. Units place for fours: 4,14,...484. Since 484 is the 49th number, that's correct. Similarly, units place for eights: 8,18,...488. 488 is the 49th, so that's correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90.

So, how many such numbers? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each block. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just quickly verify my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's 4 full blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, wait. Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.

Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, let me just go through that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place had 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For eights, the tens place: up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4 full blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and 9, totaling 49. Units place: up to 488, so 488 is included, making it 49. So, eights total 98. Fours total 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for fours. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last is 484. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and how many blocks? From 40-49 (1st block), 140-149 (2nd), 240-249 (3rd), 340-349 (4th), 440-449 (5th). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds place, 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nFor eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, so how many terms? 488-8 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: none, since the book only goes up to 488. So, 0.\n\nSo, 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98 eights.\n\nFours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 numbers (480-488). So that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.

Yes, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there?

Now, to find how many more fours than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188.

Let me check: 8,18,...,488. The first is 8, the next is 18, and so on up to 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers.

    "text": " 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,... up to 488. How many? The last occurrence is 488, which is the units digit. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through each step again. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in units place? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1 = floor(484/10) +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block of 100 has 10, and there are 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens place is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's fine. So 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So 89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10, the last has 9. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, as the book ends at 488. So total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms = ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total = 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms = ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total = 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 8,18,...,488. Let's see: 8 is the first, 18 the second, ..., 488 is the (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49th occurrence.

The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, we subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, let me think again. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one. From 0-488, how many hundreds are there? Let's see: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.
