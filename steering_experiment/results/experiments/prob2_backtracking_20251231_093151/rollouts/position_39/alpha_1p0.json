So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488.

So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, 8,18,...,488. Let me count: from 0 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? That's 488//10 +1. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer division gives 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is actually 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, 188-98 is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

    "text": " 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first 8 is at 8, and the last one in the units place is at 488. So, how many numbers? If I divide 488 by 10, that's 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full block (e.g., 80-89) has 10 numbers, so that's 10 eights per block. How many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, the number of 8's is 4 full blocks (each 10) and 9 in the last partial block. Wait, no, because each block's tens digit is 8, so in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, that's 4 full blocks (40 eights) plus 9 in the last partial block, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check again. 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 49, which seems right because 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Wait, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9, so 10+10+10+10+9=49. So that's correct. Units place for both digits: 49 each, which seems right because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers for each digit in the units place. So, yes, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90.

For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount. When counting the tens place for eights, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 eights each, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, contributing 9 eights. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens:49, so total 98. Fours: 188, eights:98. Difference: 90.

Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For the units place of fours: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check again. When counting the tens place for fours, from 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, we have 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct. So, I think my calculation is right.

The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 8 appears in the units place 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. But wait, does 380-389 fall within 488? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10. So that's 40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89. So, total eights are 89. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 89 (eights) = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Hmm, but wait, did I count correctly in the tens place for fours? Let me recount. Tens place for fours: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. That's correct. For eights, tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, 40. So, 40. So, yes, 49+40=89. So, the difference is 99. Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the units place for fours again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. We want the last term to be <=488. So, 4 + 10*(n-1) <=488. 10*(n-1) <=484. n-1 <=48.4, so n<=49.4, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct. Similarly, for eights in units place: 8,18,...,488. 8 +10*(n-1)=488. 10*(n-1)=480. n-1=48. So, n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Correct. So, fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. So, 99 more fours than eights. But wait, that seems correct, but let me think again. Wait, in the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. That's correct. So, yes, 89 fours there. So, the total is 188 fours, 89 eights. So, the answer is 99 more fours.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **89**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 89 = **99**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{99}."

So, each block except the last one has 10 numbers. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49.

For the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place fours: 49. So, 188 is correct. For eights, units place: 49, tens place:49. So, 98. Therefore, 188-98=90.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so 98 eights. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recount the units place for fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, so 48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. How many? (488-8)/10=48, so 48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many times that happens. The first 8 is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8, 18, ..., 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but since we stop at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each part again. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. When I was counting the tens place, I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. That seems right. For fours, the hundreds place is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct. Units place for fours: from 4 to 484, which is 49 numbers. Tens place for fours: from 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, I think that's correct.

    "text": " 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one more. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The first occurrence is at 8, which is the 1st, then 18 is the 2nd, and so on. To find how many, we can calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9 =49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9 (480,481,...,488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 49 numbers (since 8 is the first, then 18, ..., 488). Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check if I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place of fours, I had 50. Let me see: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct. Units place for fours: from 4 to 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. For eights: units place from 8 to 488: 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 49. Correct. So, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I feel like that might not be right. Let me check another approach. Maybe I can count the number of times each digit appears in each position for numbers from 1 to 488. Let's do that again, more carefully. **Counting digit 4:**\n\n- **Units place:** For each group of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, in each group, it's 10 numbers, so the 4 appears once per group. So, 48 groups would give 48 fours. But wait, the last group is 481-490, but our book stops at 488, so the last group is incomplete. However, the units digit 4 in 484 is still within 488, so the number of fours in the units place is 48 +1=49. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\n- **Tens place:** For the tens digit, each group of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). From 1 to 488, how many such groups are there? Let's see: 1-100: 10 fours in tens place (40-49). 101-200: 10 fours (140-149). 201-300:10 fours (240-249). 301-400:10 fours (340-349). 401-488: Now, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers. So, total tens fours: 10+10+10+10+10=50. Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 fours in tens place.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 fours in hundreds place.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\n**Counting digit 8:**\n\n- **Units place:** Similarly, for each group of 10, the units digit 8 appears once. From 1 to 488, how many? 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, and then the last group has 488, which has an 8 in units place. So, 48+1=49 eights in units place.\n\n- **Tens place:** For the tens digit, each group of 100 has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). From 1 to 488, let's count:\n\n  - 1-100: 80-89:10 eights.\n  - 101-200:180-189:10 eights.\n  - 201-300:280-289:10 eights.\n  - 301-400:380-389:10 eights.\n  - 401-488: Now, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights in the tens place here.\n\nSo, total tens eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** As before, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. So, 0 eights in hundreds place.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference: 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
