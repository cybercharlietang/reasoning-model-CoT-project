    "text": " 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. Each 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, the next set would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's an additional 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 380-389 is within 488, but 480-489 is also within 488, so 480-488. Wait, so let's see: Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus the 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's 188 -98=90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. I said that in the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. That seems right. So, yes, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

So, how many such numbers? Let's see, 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, that set only goes up to 488. So, how many complete sets do we have? Each set is 10 numbers. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49.

For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct. But let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For eights in the tens place: up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, making the total 49 in the tens place.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers. Let's check how many such blocks exist up to 488. 80-89: yes, 180-189: yes, 280-289: yes, 380-389: yes. 480-489 would be next, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place only goes up to 488. So, in the tens place, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights. How many blocks? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 blocks, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, total eights are 89. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. 49+40=89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. So, there are 99 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? For fours in hundreds place, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, correct. For eights in hundreds place, none, since 488 is less than 800. For the tens place in fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. For eights in tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, 40 eights. Correct. Units place: both fours and eights have 49 occurrences. So, 49+50+89=188 fours, and 49+40=89 eights. So, 188-89=99.

So, starting from 8, the last number would be 488. How many numbers is that? Let's calculate: The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. For fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484.

For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1=49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks gives 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) gives 9 eights, so 4*10+9=49. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: total 98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.

How many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. Now for the 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. Let's see, 488-8=480, so 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. Similarly, in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is included.

Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, etc., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

    "text": " 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488 with step 10. To find the count, we can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 are included. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks are there. From 1-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through the fours again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The count is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. So 49+50+89=188. Good. For the eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Maybe using a different approach for counting. For the fours, maybe considering each digit position separately and calculating how many times 4 appears. Similarly for the eights. But I think my initial method is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think about each digit position and calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nWait, another thought: For the hundreds place, when counting the number of 4's, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers. Let me confirm that: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for the eights in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers. That's correct because 488-480+1=9.\n\nI think my counts are accurate. So, the difference is 90.

So, starting from 8, each step of 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Let me check: 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set (480-488) has 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers: 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just verify my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I counted the units place for 4's, I got 49, but let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. Let's see: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full tens, but since 484 is included, it's 49 times. So, that's correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's, from 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor the eights: units place is 49, tens place is 49, hundreds place 0. Total eights:98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. When I counted 480-488, I considered that as 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. But wait, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, that's correct. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's think about the number of eights in the tens place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's the same as the number of times 80-89, 180-189, etc., occur.\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199:180-189:10.\n\nFrom 200-299:280-289:10.\n\nFrom 300-399:380-389:10.\n\nFrom 400-488:480-488:9.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. So, 49 eights in units place.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nThus, fours:188, eights:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Let me count how many sets: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49.

So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 8 is the units digit in 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. Each of these blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks we have. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) has 9. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check the counts again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98.

Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours than eights there are: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 40 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me see how many there are. The last number is 488, so how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four sets are 10 each, and the last set is 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems correct. For the tens place of fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Units place for fours: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. So, 49 fours in units place. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, the last has 9, so 4*10+9=49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that in the hundreds place for fours, I'm counting correctly? Because 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. So, the difference is 90.

Let me check: from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d. Here, a_1=8, d=10, a_n=488. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 488-8=480= (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49.

Now, the book goes up to 488, so 480-489 would be another set, but since 488 is the last page, 480-488 is part of it. So, each set is 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place.

So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me list them: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is okay, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so we don't include that. So, 4 sets, 40 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 +40=89. So, there are 89 eights in total.

Wait, no, 400-488 includes all numbers where the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit can be 0-8. So, the tens digit being 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Similarly, for the eights in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 49 in total. So, yeah, the calculation seems correct.

So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks within 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
