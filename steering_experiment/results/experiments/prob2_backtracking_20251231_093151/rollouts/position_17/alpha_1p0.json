    "text": " The number of 4's in the units place is actually (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that seems off. Because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten's place, there's one 4 in the units place. So, how many tens are there? From 0 to 48, that's 49 tens (since 488 is the last page, the tens go up to 8, but wait, no. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 times (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8), so each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8 in the last page. So, actually, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 include a 4 in the units place? No, 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, from 1 to 484, how many 4's in the units place? It's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). In 100-199: 140-149 (10). In 200-299: 240-249 (10). In 300-399: 340-349 (10). In 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as for 4's, which would be 48 times, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles. But wait, let's confirm: the last number with 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no. Because 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms are there? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The difference is 480, divided by 10 is 48, so number of terms is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's different from the 4's. Because 488 is included, so the 8's in the units place would be 49 times. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier with the 4's. Let me check again. For 4's in the units place, the last occurrence is 484, which is the 49th term? Wait, no. Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. The difference between 4 and 484 is 480, which is 48*10, so the number of terms is 48 + 1 = 49. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Similarly, for 8's, the last occurrence is 488, so the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, both 4's and 8's in the units place occur 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's in the units place were 48. I must have miscalculated. Let me clarify: For units digit, the number of times a digit appears is floor((last number + 1)/10). For example, for 4's: last occurrence is 484, so (484 +1)/10 = 485/10=48.5, floor is 48. But wait, that's not matching with the earlier count. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Let me think: The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is equal to (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0). So, for 4's: n=488, 488//10=48, and 488%10=8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49. Similarly for 8's: 488//10=48, and 488%10=8 >=8, so 48 +1=49. So, both 4's and 8's in the units place occur 49 times. I think earlier I made a mistake by not considering the last number. So, 49 times each. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for 8's in the tens place. The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199:180-189 (10). From 200-299:280-289 (10). From 300-399:380-389 (10). From 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total 8's in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 4's were 187 and 8's were 98, so the difference would be 89. But let me double-check the counts. Wait, for 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, earlier I thought 4's in the tens place were 50, but let me check that again. 4's in the tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times. So, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. Now, for 8's: units (49) + tens (49)=98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's in the units place were 49, but when I first calculated, I thought 48. So, let me confirm again: For units digit, the number of times 4 appears is (488//10)=48, and since 488%10=8>=4, add 1, so 49. Similarly for 8's, same logic: 49. So, 49 units each. For tens place, 4's: 50, 8's:49. Hundreds place:4's:89, 8's:0. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+49+0=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm getting 90, but earlier I thought maybe 89. Let me check the counts again. Maybe I missed something. Let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Units place:49. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place:49, tens place:49. So, 98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again: when counting the 8's in the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is the last page. So, 9 numbers there. So, 4 ranges of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought maybe 89, but now it's 90. Let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct. Let's say a book with 50 pages. How many 4's and 8's? Units place: 4,14,24,34,44: 5 times. 8's:8,18,28,38,48:5 times. Tens place:40-49:10 numbers, but since the book is only 50 pages, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in tens place. 8's in tens place: only 80-89, but book is only up to 50, so no 8's in tens place. Hundreds place: none. So, total 4's:5+10=15. 8's:5+0=5. Difference:10. Now, using my method: units place for 4's: (50//10)=5, and 50%10=0<4, so 5. Similarly for 8's: (50//10)=5, 50%10=0<8, so 5. Tens place for 4's: 40-49 is 10 numbers. For 8's: none. So, total 4's:5+10=15, 8's:5. Difference 10. That's correct. So, my method works for this case. So, applying it to 488 pages, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Actually, from 4 to 484, that's every 10 numbers, so (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's see how many full ranges we have. The first range is 40-49, which is within 1-488. The second is 140-149, also within range. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's. So 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, similar to the 4's, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 8's. Let's check if 480-489 is within 488. Since 488 is the last page, 480-488 is part of the range, but only up to 488. So, the range 480-489 is only partially included. So, the full ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, for the tens place, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 8's. The last range, 480-488, contributes 9 8's because 488 is the last page. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 8's. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 484 is the 49th number because starting from 4, each step is +10. So from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 occurrences. Let's see how many ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 ranges, so 4*10=40. But wait, does 380-389 go beyond 488? No, because 389 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 40 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49+40=89. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 89 = 99.

    "text": " Let's see, starting from 4, each subsequent occurrence is 10 apart. So, 4 is the 1st, 14 is the 2nd, ..., 484 is the (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49th occurrence. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the last block would be 440-449, which is within 488. So, there are 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each block contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but the book only goes up to 488, so does 440-449 fit entirely? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-489 would only go up to 488. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks are complete (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences. So, total in the tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 can appear in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8 in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n   \nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The pattern is every 10 numbers, so starting from 4, the next is 14, and so on. The nth term can be expressed as 10n - 6. Let me see: when n=1, 10*1 -6=4, which is correct. When n=49, 10*49 -6=484. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 49th number because 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10, so n = (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, yes, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, so 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, how many ranges? 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let's check if 440-449 is fully within 400-488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for page numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99, 99+89=188. So, 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see, the last occurrence is 488. So, how many numbers? Using the same approach as before, the nth term is 10n -2. When n=1, 10*1 -2=8. When n=49, 10*49 -2=488. So, 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the range. So, how many ranges? From 0-99: 80-89 is one range (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, that's only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, for the hundreds place, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, total tens place occurrences: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=40+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98. That also seems correct.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. For the tens digit 8, in the hundreds place 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, yes, 4 ranges of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49. So, 49 in tens place. So, 49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can list out the counts again.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. That's (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n- Tens: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488. 488-400 +1=89.\nTotal 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n- Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. First four ranges are 10 each, last is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires comparing the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo determine the number of 4's:\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTo determine the number of 8's:\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This would be in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers in each of these ranges have 4 in the tens place. - 40-49: There are 10 numbers, each with 4 in the tens place. - 140-149: Similarly, 10 numbers. - 240-249: 10 numbers. - 340-349: 10 numbers. - 440-449: 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, totaling 50 occurrences. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 4,14,...,484: 49 numbers. Tens: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 50. Hundreds: 400-488: 89. So yes, 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. Now, does 480-489 fall within our book? The book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it, but only up to 488. So, in the tens place, 480-488 has 8's in the tens place. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, instead of 10, it's 9. Therefore, the tens place counts are: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. Total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 8's = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 (49 occurrences)\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 (50 occurrences)\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 (89 occurrences)\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 (49 occurrences)\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 (49 occurrences)\n- **Hundreds place:** None (0 occurrences)\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference = 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many such blocks there are. Each block has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences. From 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484: 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers. So total 49+50+89=188. Hmm, seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many blocks. Each block has 10 numbers. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, so 4*10=40. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? 480-489: yes, but the book only goes up to 488. So, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, the tens place blocks are 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 blocks, but actually, there are 5 blocks, with the last one having only 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40 for the first four blocks, plus 9 for the last, totaling 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 8's. Let me check the units place again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 8, then every 10 numbers after that. So, the last occurrence is at 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, plus the 8 at 488. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, yes, 49 is correct. Similarly, in the tens place, we have 49 occurrences as calculated. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so we don't include that. So, 4 blocks, 40 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 +40=89.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 -89=99.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 40\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 89\n\nDifference: 188 -89=99.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488. So, 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 40 + 0 = 89.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{99}"

    "text": " If I take 484, that's 484/10 = 48.4, but actually, it's the 49th number because starting from 4 (which is 4*1), 14 is 4*3 + 2, but maybe a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as floor((N + 1)/10). So for N=488, it's floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. So, 48 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place. Let me confirm: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Oh, so I think my initial calculation was wrong. It should be 49 times. Because from 4 to 484, that's 49 numbers where the units digit is 4. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in the first 100 pages (1-100), the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Now, 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's valid. How many ranges is that? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so it's okay. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding these up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? Let's see, starting at 8, the last one is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is valid, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count the ranges:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 (since 489 is beyond 488)\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding these up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nSo, total 8's printed are 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " If I start counting from 4 as the first, then every 10th number adds another. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each complete set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. The total number of complete sets of 10 in 488 is 48 full sets (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). So, 48 times 1 is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the units place, the last 4 would be at 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 4,14,...,484 is 49 numbers. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full occurrences, but actually, 488 is the 48th set (since 480 is the 48th multiple of 10). So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, no, because 4 is the first, then 14 is the second, so 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. Solving for n: 4 + 10(n-1) = 484 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, yes, 49 times. But wait, 488 \u00f7 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 8 pages beyond 480. So, in those 8 extra pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 481-488: the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, there's one more 4 at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 (from 1-480) +1 (484) =49. Okay, so 49 4's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, counting how many times 4 appears in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these decades has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such decades there are up to 488.\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? This is in numbers from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds =49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** How many times does 8 appear in the units digit? Similar to the 4's, it's every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of complete sets of 10, which is 48 full sets (since 488 \u00f710=48.8), and then check the remaining 8 pages (481-488). In each set, there's one 8 (like 8,18,...,488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 49, because 488 is included. Let me verify: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 +10(n-1)=488. Solving: 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, counting 8's in the tens place. This occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds =49 +49 +0=98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49. Correct, because from 4,14,...,484 is 49 numbers.\n- Tens place: 50. Correct, 5 sets of 10.\n- Hundreds place: 89. Correct, from 400-488 is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place:49. Correct, from 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers.\n- Tens place:49. Correct, as calculated.\n- Hundreds place:0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488)\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the 48th group ends at 480, so the next number is 481, 482, etc., up to 488. So, in the units place, the 4 appears 48 times? Wait, no, because 484 is within the 480-489 range, so that's the 48th occurrence. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. For the units place, the number of 4's is equal to the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9 up to 488. So, for each 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, total number of 4's in units place = floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But does the 48th group include 484? Yes, because 480-489 would be the 48th group, but since we only go up to 488, the 484 is included. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does the 440-449 block go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so does that add one more? Let me see: 8,18,...,488. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. Wait, no, 8 is the first, 18 the second, ..., 488 is the (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last one, which contributes 9 (since 488 is the last page). So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of such numbers is (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49? Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Wait, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me recalculate units place for 4's. The first 4 in units is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the last one is 484. So, how many terms are there in the sequence 4,14,24,...,484? The nth term is 10(n-1)+4. So, 10(n-1)+4=484. 10(n-1)=480. n-1=48. So, n=49. So, units place for 4's is 49. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but actually it's 49. So, that changes things. So, units place for 4's:49. Then, tens place:50. Hundreds place:89. So total 4's:49+50+89=188. Now, for 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. So, total 8's=98. So, difference=188-98=90. Wait, so earlier I had 187-98=89, but now it's 188-98=90. Which one is correct? Let me check again. For units place of 4's: The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? Let me compute (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, units place for 4's is 49. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 40-49:10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers. Correct. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't overcount the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. Correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. So, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Maybe it's better to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete decades. In each decade, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, the number of 4's in the units place should be the number of times the units digit is 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, it's the same as the number of times 4 appears in the units place, which is floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but does the 48th occurrence include 484? Let me list some: 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because 484 is 48*10 +4, so it's the 49th occurrence? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think differently. The number of numbers ending with 4 from 1 to N can be calculated as floor((N + 6)/10). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the count is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units place, which is (488 + 1) // 10. Because when you add 1, you're including the end point. So (488 +1) =489, divided by 10 is 48.9, so floor is 48. Wait, but 488 is the last number, and 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. So, 48 times. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? From 40-49: 10 numbers, 40-49. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 *10 =50. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so that's valid. So, 5 ranges, each with 10 4's in the tens place, so 50 4's. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 < 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) =48+50=98+89=187. Now, let me check if I did that right. Units:48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Similar to the 4's, it's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 end with 8? Yes, 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, how many such numbers? Let's calculate. The first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. So, how many terms are there? The formula is similar: (488 -8)/10 +1. So, (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. Alternatively, since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 ends with 8, it's 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Now, let's see how many such ranges are there up to 488. 80-89: yes, that's 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489: but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, how many full ranges of 10 are there? 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389: that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, the partial range at 480-488 contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 40+9=49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the hundreds digit is 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. So, 187 -98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 187-98=89. Yep, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 89.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in page numbers 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges contributing 40 and a partial range (480-488) contributing 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " If I take 484 - 4 = 480, then 480 / 10 = 48. So that's 49 numbers (including both 4 and 484). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because 484 is the 49th term. So, actually, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, gives us (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included. Let me count how many such blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many blocks are there? Starting from 40-49 (which is the first block), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484: 49 times. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., 5 blocks, 10 each: 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89. So total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 380-389. How many blocks? 80-89: 1 block, 180-189: another, 280-289: another, 380-389: another. That's 4 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check again. 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) = 89. Difference: 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, but wait, in the hundreds place, for 4's, we have 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so that's correct. For 8's, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. So total 89. So, yes, 188 - 89 = 99. Therefore, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

    "text": " From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480/10 = 48 numbers where the units digit is 4. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once more at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many complete blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, all 5 blocks are within the 488-page limit. Therefore, tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but does 488 count? Yes, because the hundreds digit is still 4. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's count the blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens place 8's in 480-488 are 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, 480-489 would have the tens digit as 8, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, I think I need to adjust. Earlier, I considered 4 blocks of 10, which would take us up to 380-389. Then, 480-488 is another partial block. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The formula is usually floor((n + 10 - d)/10), where d is the digit. But maybe a better way is to think that for each complete set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, in the last partial set from 481 to 488, does 484 count as an additional 4? Yes, because 484 is within 481-488, so that's one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, that seems right. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens digit. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488?

So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, totaling 5*10=50 fours. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. Now, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each complete set of 10 numbers contributes one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. That's 48 eights. Now, in the last partial set (481-488), 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many complete ranges of 10 are there where the tens digit is 8? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 4 complete ranges of 10, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, and one partial range of 9 numbers contributing 9 eights. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " Maybe I should calculate it differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, does 484 count as the 49th? Because 484 is 48*10 + 4, so yes, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, but 480-488 is part of the book. Wait, but in the tens place, 4 can appear in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, then 140-149, another 10, 240-249, another 10, 340-349, another 10, and 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, so yes. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number contributes one digit, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so yes, that's 89 times. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers? The formula is (last number - first number)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So units: 49. Tens place: Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-99, 40-49: 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149: 10. 200-299: 240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488: 440-449:10, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 450-488 is beyond that. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So tens place:50. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. So total 4's: 49+50+89= 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many times. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? Using the same formula: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So units place:49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the book. So, let's count each set:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place:0.\n\nSo total 8's: units(49) + tens(49) + hundreds(0)=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units: 4,14,24,...,484. That's every 10th number starting at 4. So from 4 to 484, how many? (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488:89 numbers, each has a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units:8,18,28,...,488. Let's see, 488 is included, so (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

    "text": " If I consider that starting from 4, every 10th number adds another 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The formula would be floor(488 / 10) = 48 times. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is the last page, so 8 is in the units place. So, how many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so maybe it's 49? Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's count: From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 how many numbers? 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: Units: 48, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. Now for the 8's: Units: 49, Tens: 49. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the 8's in the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, total 98. So, the difference is 89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98.

    "text": " Maybe it's better to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The pattern repeats every 10 numbers. So, in 488 numbers, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In those 8 numbers, the units digit is 1-8, so no additional 4's. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another range, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's five ranges in total, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times 8 appears in the units place. From 1-488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so the 8 appears once more at 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these ranges. From 1-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 is beyond 488, so we only go up to 488. So, 480-488 is part of the range, but since we're only considering up to 488, the tens digit here is 8 for 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is in the hundreds place, but the tens digit is 8. So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total ranges: 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to number N is given by floor(N/10) + 1 if the units digit is >= d, but maybe it's better to think of it as for every 10 numbers, the digit appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, which is 48. But wait, in the 480th group, which is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 appears once more at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, each hundred block has another block. From 1-99, we have one block (40-49). From 100-199, another block (140-149). Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349, and 400-488: 440-449. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 40-49 (1), 140-149 (2), 240-249 (3), 340-349 (4), 440-449 (5). That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, in the 440-449 block, does it go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, 50 total. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, count how many times 8 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. But in the last group (481-490), we have 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89 (1), 180-189 (2), 280-289 (3), 380-389 (4), 480-488 (5). So, 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which only has 9 numbers (480-488). So, first four blocks: 4 blocks *10=40. The last block: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.

So, in the units place, each decade contributes one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: The first occurrence is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term can be expressed as 10n - 6, where n starts at 1. So, 10n -6 = 484 \u2192 10n = 490 \u2192 n=49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so yes, 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 10 numbers. So, each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many hundreds do we have? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only up to 449, right? Because 450-488 would have tens digits 5,6,7,8,9. So, yes, 440-449 is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 5\u00d710=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-499, but our book ends at 488, so 400-488. So, the number of times 4 appears in the hundreds place is 89. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is within the book. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers. The nth term is 10n - 2. So, 10n -2 = 488 \u2192 10n=490 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's see: From 1-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 how many numbers? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This occurs in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188-98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me verify the 4's again: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99+89=188. 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's correct. For the tens place of 4's, we had 5 sets: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct. For the units place of 4's, we had 49 numbers, which seems correct because 484 is the last one, and 484/10=48.4, so 49 times. For the 8's, units place:49, which is correct because 488 is included. Tens place:49, which is correct because 480-488 is 9 numbers, plus the other four sets of 10 each. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each range contributes 10 numbers except the last, which contributes 9. Total = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. The pattern repeats every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, which gives 48 occurrences. But wait, 488 is the last page. So, in the units place, from 1 to 480, each 10 numbers contribute one 4, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, but does 449 exceed 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 occurrences. So, 4's in the tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be pages 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 +89=187. So, 187 occurrences of 4. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last page is 488, so the units digit 8 appears in 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers up to 488. So, how many times does this happen? Let's divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 occurrences. But wait, does 488 count as an extra? Let me check: 8,18,...,488. The first is 8, the next is 18, and so on. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8 (1*8), then 18 (2*8), up to 488 (488 is 8*61). Wait, 8*61 is 488. So, 61 occurrences? Wait, that can't be right because 8*61 is 488, but 8*1=8, 8*2=16, etc., up to 8*61=488. So, that would be 61 numbers where the units digit is 8. Wait, but 8*61 is 488, so the number of times 8 appears in the units place is 61. Hmm, that seems conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me clarify: the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so in each block of 10, there's one 8. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, total 48 +1=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). Now, from 400-488: The next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 are included. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the 400-488 range. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89 up to 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So, 98 occurrences of 8. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times up to 480, with no additional 4 in 481-488.\n   - Total: 48\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n   - Total: 50\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - Total: 89\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (including 488).\n   - Total: 49\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with an additional 9 in 480-488.\n   - Total: 49\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 never appears as the hundreds digit.\n   - Total: 0\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should calculate it differently. The number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence. So, yes, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, right? So that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, but does 449 count? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? Let's see, starting at 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The last number is 488, which ends with an 8. So, how many terms are there? The first term is 8, which is 8 = 8*1, the next is 18=8*2 + 2, wait, perhaps a better way is to think of it as the sequence 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The difference between each term is 10, so it's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The nth term is given by a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10. We want a_n \u2264 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, there are 49 terms. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, how many ranges? From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 contributes 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. I thought it was 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 4 full ranges of 10 and one partial range of 9, totaling 49. So, yes, 49. So, 187-98=89.

    "text": " If I list them, starting from 4, each subsequent number is +10. So, the nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Solving for n: 484 - 4 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488. So, does 484 exist? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers long. Let's count how many such blocks there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one block. Then 140-149: another. 240-249: another. 340-349: another. 440-449: another. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let's check if 440-449 is within the book's page count. Since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is within that range. So, yes, 5 blocks, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, let me confirm: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Using the same approach: nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 488 - 8 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last block. Let's count the blocks: 80-89: 10 numbers, but wait, 80-89 is within 1-488, so yes. 180-189: yes. 280-289: yes. 380-389: yes. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four blocks each have 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So, total occurrences in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89, that's 10, then 180-189: another 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence formula: ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers. How many blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 is one. From 100-199: 180-189 is another. 280-289 and 380-389. That's 4 blocks. 4 blocks * 10 = 40 occurrences. Wait, but does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489. So that's a fifth block. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50 occurrences. Wait, but 480-489 is within 488, so 480-488 is part of that. But since we're only counting up to 488, the numbers 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, for the hundreds digit 4, it's only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. The blocks where the tens digit is 8 are: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Wait, that's different from my initial thought. So, units place had 49, tens place has 49 as well. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49+50=99; 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. I thought that in the hundreds place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so in the tens place, that's 9 occurrences. So, the tens place for 8's is 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. Units place: same as 4's, 49. So, 98 total 8's. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many complete blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so all five blocks are within 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, no, that's not right. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so each contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same formula as before: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. Now, from 400-488, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but only 480-488 is within the book. So, how many complete blocks do we have? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four blocks, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, the 480-488 block is incomplete. From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so the numbers are 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 8's. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the tens place, each block contributes 10 8's, but the last block is only 9 numbers. So, the total in the tens place is 4 complete blocks (each 10) plus 9 in the incomplete block. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid.

So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, inclusive. The number of numbers is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within 488. 480-489 is up to 489, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place for 8. So, how many blocks? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total blocks: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and the last partial block 480-488 contributing 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9 =49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 =98. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188 -98 =90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers. How many blocks? From 40-49:1, 140-149:2, 240-249:3, 340-349:4, 440-449:5. So, 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. Now, 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place:0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, when counting the tens place for 8's, in the 480-488 range, does that include 480-488, which is 9 numbers? Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 full blocks of 10, and one partial block of 9, totaling 49. Correct. So, 98 8's. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can think of each digit position separately and count the number of times each digit appears. For units place: 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so total number is floor(488/10)=48 full tens, but since 488 is included, we have 49 times. Similarly for 8: same logic, 49 times. Wait, but in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. But in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. In the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-100, 101-200, ..., 401-488. Wait, 401-488 is only part of the 400s. Let me see: 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is fully included.

Now, let me count the number of 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Now, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but in the tens place, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. Wait, let me check again. From 80-89: 10. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49? Wait, no, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for those 9 numbers. So, total in tens place is 49? Wait, no, because 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, adding up: 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me recount the tens place. The 8's in the tens place are: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 in tens place. Units place is 49, so total 8's is 49+49=98. Now, the 4's were 188. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each block (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 numbers, and 480-488 contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since page numbers go up to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " From 4 to 484, how many numbers with 4 in the units place? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the ranges would be 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, right? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: 80-89 is within 488, so that's one range. Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 380-389 is within 488, but 480-489 would be the next, but 488 is the last page. So, how many ranges? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, does 380-389 count? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So, 40 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 40 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 380-389).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 40 + 0 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " Maybe it's better to calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1. So, (484 - 4) is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times 4 appears in the page numbers. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The last number with 8 in the units place before or equal to 488 is 488. So, starting from 8, each step of 10. The count would be (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's check how many such blocks exist within 488. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears only 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) and 1 block of 9 (from 400-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times 8 appears in the page numbers. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated as floor(488 / 10) = 48. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Let's count the blocks: 40-49 (1), 140-149 (2), 240-249 (3), 340-349 (4), 440-449 (5). So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. That's 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4's appear 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, breaking it into units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? Similar to the 4's, it's floor(488 / 10) = 48. But wait, 488 is included, so does that make it 49? Let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see if 480-489 is within 488. Yes, 480-489 is within 488, so that's another block. Wait, but 480-489 is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Hmm, so does that affect the count? Let me think. For the tens place, each block is 10 numbers, except possibly the last one if it exceeds 488. So, from 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, the first four blocks each have 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences in the tens place. So, total tens place: 40 (from the first four blocks) + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8's appear 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, 4's are printed 89 more times than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me calculate how many numbers between 1 and 488 have 4 in the units place. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms in this sequence can be found by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count them: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers So, that's 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 numbers. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so all these are valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 4's. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count them: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers Now, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Wait, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range is 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, instead of 10, it's 9 numbers. Therefore, the tens place 8's are in 4 ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 4 full ranges of 10 and one partial range of 9. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me double-check. The first four ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10. The next would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, total 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 8's. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, in the tens place, I thought it was 49, but let me recount. The tens place 8's are in the ranges: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. Units place is 49, so total 98. Now, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify the count of 4's: Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 =48 +1=49. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, for the 8's: Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's=49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit surprised because I thought maybe the hundreds place would have more 4's, but it's 89, which is a significant number. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For a three-digit number, each digit can be considered separately. Let's consider each digit position:\n\n- **Units place:** For each digit from 0-9, each digit appears equally in the units place. Since there are 488 numbers, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 full cycles, and then 8 extra numbers (488 = 48\u00d710 + 8). So, for digits 0-7, they appear 48 times, and digits 8 and 9 appear 48 +1 times each because the extra 8 numbers include 8 and 9. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the units digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for 488 numbers, the number of full cycles is 48 full cycles (48\u00d710=480 numbers), and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, for each digit 0-9, in the units place, they appear 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, digits 1-8 each get an extra 1 count, and digits 9 and 0 don't get any extra. So, total counts in units place:\n\n- Digits 0: 48\n- Digits 1-8: 48 +1=49\n- Digit 9:48\n\nSo, for digit 4: 49 times in units place.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8: 49 times in units place.\n\nNow, for the tens place:\n\nIn the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers. So, for 488 numbers, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 numbers (401-488). Wait, no, 488 is less than 500, so it's 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488). But actually, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 full hundreds (1-400), each digit appears 4\u00d710=40 times in the tens place. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last). So, from 401-409: tens digit is 0 (401-409 is 9 numbers, but 401-409 is actually 9 numbers, but wait, 401-409 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 0 for 401-409? Wait, no. Wait, 401-409: the tens digit is 0 for 401-409? Wait, no. Wait, 401 is 4 0 1, so tens digit is 0. 410 is 4 1 0, so tens digit is 1. Wait, no, 401 is 401, so the tens digit is 0. Then 410 is 4 1 0, so tens digit is 1. Wait, but 401-488 includes 401-499, but we only go up to 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-409) to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place in 401-488?\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-409: 9 numbers\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 2: 420-429:10\n- Tens digit 3:430-439:10\n- Tens digit 4:440-449:10\n- Tens digit 5:450-459:10\n- Tens digit 6:460-469:10\n- Tens digit 7:470-479:10\n- Tens digit 8:480-488:9 numbers\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488:\n\n- Digits 1-7: 10 each\n- Digit 0:9\n- Digit 8:9\n\nSo, adding to the previous 40 times each from the first 400 pages, the total for each digit in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 0:40 +9=49\n- Digits 1-7:40 +10=50 each\n- Digit 8:40 +9=49\n- Digit 9:40 (since 488 doesn't reach 490, so digit 9 in tens place doesn't appear in the last partial hundred)\n\nWait, but wait, in the first 400 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, in 401-488, digit 0 appears 9 times, digits 1-7 appear 10 times each, and digit 8 appears 9 times. So, total for each digit in the tens place:\n\n- 0:40+9=49\n- 1:40+10=50\n- 2:40+10=50\n- 3:40+10=50\n- 4:40+10=50\n- 5:40+10=50\n- 6:40+10=50\n- 7:40+10=50\n- 8:40+9=49\n- 9:40\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the first 400 pages, the tens digit cycles 0-9 four times, so each digit appears 4\u00d710=40 times. Then, in 401-488, as above, digits 1-7 get 10 more, 0 and 8 get 9 more, and 9 doesn't get any. So, for digit 4 in the tens place: 40 +10=50. Similarly, digit 8 in the tens place:40 +9=49.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place:50, and 8's in the tens place:49.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place:\n\nIn the hundreds place, digits go from 1 to 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, digit 1 appears 100 times (100-199), digit 2 appears 100 times (200-299), digit 3 appears 100 times (300-399), and digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488). So, for digit 4 in the hundreds place:89, and for digit 8:0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 90 seemed high, but upon checking each digit place, it seems correct. Let me just confirm the counts again.\n\nWait, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. In the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. In the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, 49+50+89=188 for 4's, and 49+49+0=98 for 8's. The difference is indeed 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49 numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many full decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades. In each decade, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last full decade is 480-488, which includes 484 as the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, 484 is within the 480-489 decade, but since we only go up to 488, does that affect it? Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is equal to the number of times 4 appears in each decade. Each decade has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 decades, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is included, which is another 4 in the units place. So that's 49 times in total for the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 484 is within 481-488, so yes, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10) From 200-299: 240-249 (10) From 300-399: 340-349 (10) From 400-488: 440-449 (10) Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, how many ranges is that? 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's okay. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me double-check each part. Units place: 49 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? The last occurrence is 488, which is the units digit. So, how many full decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 480-488 range, the units digit 8 occurs at 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10) From 100-199: 180-189 (10) From 200-299: 280-289 (10) From 300-399: 380-389 (10) From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all, so 9 times). So, total tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, let me check: units 49, tens 49, so 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89, total 188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0, total 98. 188-98=90. That seems correct.

    "text": " The sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) where n is the count. So, 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. Solving for n: 10*(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 484 is within the range, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, 484 is the last 4 in the units place. So, from 4 to 484, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges exist. The first range is 40-49, which is within 1-488. The next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. How many ranges is that? 40-49 is the first, then each hundred block adds another. From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let me add them up: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The sequence is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 8,18,...,488. So, solving for n: 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488 => 10*(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, how many ranges are there? 80-89: valid, 180-189: valid, 280-289: valid, 380-389: valid, and 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 8's in the tens place. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds:89, total 188. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 4's. Let me recount the tens place for 4's. The ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, and 480-488 contributing 9, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. So, 188 - 98 =90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 488 -400 +1 =89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct. So, the total 4's are 49 +50 +89=188. 8's are 49 +49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 is in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's the number of complete decades (sets of 10 numbers) times 1, plus any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence? Wait, no, because 480-488 is the 49th decade, right? Wait, no, 1-10 is the first decade, 11-20 the second, etc. So 481-490 would be the 49th decade, but since we're only going up to 488, in the 481-488 range, the units digit 4 occurs once (484). So, total number of 4's in units place is 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (484), totaling 49. Wait, but earlier I thought 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48. But then 484 is in the 48th decade, which is 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so 484 is included. So actually, it's 48 times. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. For the units digit, the number of 4's is equal to the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9. From 1 to 488, how many full cycles of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full cycle, the units digit 4 appears once. So 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So total 48 +1=49 times in the units place. Okay, so units place: 49 4's.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. In the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 +89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nSimilarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) contribute 10 numbers, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds =49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Yes.\n\nSo now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The question is how many more 4's than 8's. So 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units:49. Let me count: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The last one is 484, which is the 48th occurrence in units place because 484 =4 +10*(n-1). So n= (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens:50. Each 40-49, 140-149, etc., 5 ranges, each 10 numbers. 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds:89. From 400-488, inclusive. 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49. From 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so 49.\n\n- Tens:49. Ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four ranges gives 10, and the last gives 9. 4*10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check if I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, when counting the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488 as a range with 9 numbers. So that's correct because 480-488 is 9 numbers (including both 480 and 488). So that's 9 8's in the tens place for that range.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, I think that's all correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me list them. From 1-488, the numbers ending with 4 are 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms in this sequence can be found by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Let's count how many numbers there are in each of these ranges. - 40-49: 10 numbers (40 to 49 inclusive)\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nBut wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges. So, 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in numbers like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 480-488 range would have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and then 480-488 contributing 9. So, total is 4*10 +9=40+9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are up to 488. - 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nThat's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is a partial range because the book ends at 488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 4 full ranges and one partial. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's see how many complete blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. Now, from 400-488: The next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the hundreds place for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many 8's? Each of the first four blocks (0-399) contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, we have 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Finally, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, but in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So, in each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, for 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is fully included. So, how many hundreds have the tens digit 4? Let's see: 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). 101-200: 140-149 (10). 201-300: 240-249 (10). 301-400: 340-349 (10). 401-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences in the tens place. Wait, but 401-488 is only part of the last hundred, but since 440-449 is within 401-488, it's fully included. So, 50 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, no, that's not right. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89. Wait, but actually, each page number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 480-488. So, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 1-100: 80-89 (10). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480-488). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, for the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) and then 9 in the last partial block. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Another way to calculate this is to take the total number of pages, 488, and for each ten's place, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page. So, does the 49th 4 in the units place occur at 484, which is within 488? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Wait, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me think again. For each ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, total 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. Let's consider how often this happens. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there in 488 pages? Let's see: The first range is 40-49, which is within 1-488. The next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Now, 440-449 is within 488, but what about 540-549? That's beyond 488, so we don't include that. So, how many ranges is that? Let's count: 40-49 (1), 140-149 (2), 240-249 (3), 340-349 (4), 440-449 (5). So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but I need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place as well. Let's see: from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400 to 488 inclusive is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? Let's see: The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. To find how many, I can take 488 and divide by 10, which gives 48.8. So, there are 48 full sets of ten, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Let's count how many full ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, each of the first four ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last range contributes 9. So, total 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89: yes, 10 numbers. 180-189: same. 280-289: same. 380-389: same. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9, total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 98 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as starting from 4 and adding 10 each time. So, the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's one block. Then 140-149: another. 240-249: another. 340-349: another. 440-449: another. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, right? So, that's five blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but does 400-488 have 89 numbers? Let me check: 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10. So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in tens place is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For the 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
