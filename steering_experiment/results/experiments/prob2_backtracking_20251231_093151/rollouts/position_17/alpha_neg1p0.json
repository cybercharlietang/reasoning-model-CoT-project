    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check the last number: 488. So, starting from 8, the last one is 488. How many such numbers? The formula is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let me check if 480-489 is within the book's pages. The book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block. Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so numbers from 480-488 have the tens digit as 8. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (since 480 is the first and 488 is the last). So, how many blocks? 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Occurs in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Occurs in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, with 5 blocks in total.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Occurs in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Occurs in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers for the first four blocks and 9 for the last.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. The formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to number N is floor((N + 1)/10). So for 488, it would be floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. But wait, 488 has 488 as the last page, so the units digit 4's would be 4,14,...,484. Let me list them: from 4 to 484, each step of 10. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So that's 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included. So units place 4's: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So from 1-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: 10. From 200-299: 240-249:10. From 300-399:340-349:10. From 400-488:440-449:10, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but from 400-488, the tens digit 4 goes from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 5*10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So that's 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. So hundreds place 4's:89. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds:49 +50 +89= 188. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So total 4's:188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers:8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So number of terms: (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48 +1=49. So units place 8's:49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each block. From 1-99:80-89:10 numbers. From 100-199:180-189:10. From 200-299:280-289:10. From 300-399:380-389:10. From 400-488:480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, inclusive. 488 -480 +1=9 numbers. So total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's:0. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds:49 +49 +0=98. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. From 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, not 10. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So total 8's:49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This totals 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong before. Let me correct that. So, in the units place, 4 appears 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 up to 440-449, that's 5 ranges. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is fully included. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are present. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The last number is 488, so (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 numbers. The last range, 480-488, contributes 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " That's 484 - 4 divided by 10 plus 1, which is (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so it's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number contributes a 4, so that's 89 4's. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189 is another. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. That's four blocks. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Now, check if 480-489 is within the book. 480-489 would be another block, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this block. So, does that count as a full block? No, because only 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the tens place, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but only 9 numbers. So, actually, the tens place 8's would be: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now it's 49. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) gives 10 8's, so that's 4\u00d710=40. Then, the last partial block 480-488 gives 9 8's in the tens place (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. So, 49 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let's count how many full sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and each set contributes 10 4's in the tens place. The first set is 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets there are. The first four sets are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Now, the last set is 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the tens place, each of these has an 8, so that's 9 more. So total in the tens place is 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. So total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 +49 +0=98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488.

There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages don't reach 800.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, starting from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's calculate how many such blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10 numbers), 240-249 (10 numbers), 340-349 (10 numbers), and 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times this happens. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the range. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me recount. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\) times.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\) times.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\) times.\n\n**Difference:**\n- \\( 188 \\text{ (4's)} - 98 \\text{ (8's)} = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's one block. Then 140-149: another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 also count? Since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is within the range, so yes, it counts. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = floor(484/10) +1 = 48 +1=49. That's correct. Tens place: each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. From 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks \u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in numbers ending with 8: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block is 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10. From 100-199:180-189, another 10. 200-299:280-289, 10. 300-399:380-389, 10. 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, 8 in the tens place is 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the hundreds place 4, the tens place 8 occurs 9 times. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. However, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only up to 449, right? Wait, no, actually, 400-488 includes 400-409, 410-419, ..., 440-449, and then 450-488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there? From 0 to 4 hundreds. Let me see: 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count these. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many hundreds we have. 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: Does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 would be from 480 to 489, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but in the tens place, the 8 is in the tens digit, so 480-488 has the tens digit as 8 only for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480 is the first and 488 is the last). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) and 9 from 400-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Therefore, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so does the 440-449 range count fully? Yes, because 449 is less than 488.

I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? Using the same method: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers from 80 to 89, 180 to 189, 280 to 289, 380 to 389, and 480 to 488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 40 + 9 = 49. Therefore, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding them up: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, that's different from my initial thought. So, in the units place, 4 appears 49 times. Let me confirm: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In those extra 8 numbers, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (at 484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The blocks are 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check the last block. 440-449 is within 1-488, so yes, all 10 numbers are present. So 5 blocks * 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 occurrences. But wait, that's not correct. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me think again. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times this happens. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block of 10 numbers contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but only 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, for the first four blocks, we have 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus the last block's 9, so total 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This occurs in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 blocks.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, so actually, there are 49 occurrences in the units place. Hmm, maybe I was too quick to take the integer part. Let me think again: For numbers from 1 to N, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is floor((N - d)/10) + 1 if d <= N. So, for N=488, d=4: floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = floor(484/10) +1 = 48 +1=49. Similarly, for d=8: floor((488 -8)/10)+1= floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, so both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place? Hmm, that seems a bit counterintuitive because 488 is a higher number, but maybe it's correct. Let me check with an example. From 1 to 100, how many 4's in units place? 4,14,24,...,94: that's 10 times. Similarly, 8's: 8,18,...,98: 10 times. So, in each set of 10 numbers, each digit appears once in the units place. So, for 488, which is 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20,..., 481-490), but wait, 488 is less than 490, so actually, it's 48 full decades and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each full decade, each digit appears once in the units place. So, 48 decades would give 48 occurrences for each digit. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So total for units place: 48 +1=49 for 4, and 48 +1=49 for 8. So, same number. Hmm, so in units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. Now, moving on to the tens place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Similarly, 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set for 8 is 480-488. Let's count how many times each digit appears in the tens place. For 4: Each block of 100 numbers has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1,2,3,4. So, for each hundred, except the last one, we have a full set of 10 numbers with tens digit 4. Let's see:\n\n- 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total for 4 in tens place: 5 sets of 10, so 50 times.\n\nWait, but let me check the last set. 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So total 5 sets, 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 480-488: but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the last set, instead of 10, it's 9.\n\nSo, total for 8 in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus the last set 480-488 which is 9, so total 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480 is the start and 488 is the end). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for 8 in tens place: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nTherefore, 4 appears 50 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nSo, so far, for tens place: 4's:50, 8's:49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since our book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Units place: 4's=49, 8's=49\n- Tens place: 4's=50, 8's=49\n- Hundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0\n\nNow, total number of 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal number of 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nWait, so 4's:188, 8's:98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- For 4: floor((488-4)/10)+1= floor(484/10)+1=48+1=49\n- For 8: floor((488-8)/10)+1= floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49\n\nSo, units: both 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4: in each hundred, 10 numbers with tens digit 4. From 0-488, how many hundreds? 5 (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). But in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 sets, each with 10 numbers: 5*10=50.\n\n- For 8: similar, but in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 full sets (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399) each with 10 numbers: 4*10=40, plus 9 in the last set: total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4: 400-488: 488-400+1=89 numbers.\n- For 8: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8. In the range 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this by considering each digit position separately and calculating the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nAnother way: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 appears and the number of times 8 appears.\n\nLet me try that approach to cross-verify.\n\n**Units digit:**\n\nFor any digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(N/10)\nPlus 1 if the remainder is >=d.\n\nBut actually, the formula is:\n\ncount = (N // 10) * 1 + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, no, more accurately, it's:\n\ncount = (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(N % 10 - d +1, 0), 1)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think as:\n\nFor units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each block of 10 numbers. So, for N=488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488//10=48 blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, in the partial block (481-488), check how many 4's and 8's are there.\n\nSo, for 4 in units place:\n\n48 blocks *1=48, plus in the partial block (481-488), check if 4 is present. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once. So total 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly for 8: 48 blocks *1=48, plus in the partial block, 8 appears once (at 488). So total 48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place: both 49.\n\n**Tens digit:**\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit, each digit appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times in each block. So, for N=488, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 4 blocks (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400). Each block contributes 10 times the digit in the tens place. So, for 4 in tens place: 4 blocks *10=40. Then, in the partial block 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nFor 8 in tens place: 4 blocks *10=40. Then, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total 40+9=49.\n\n**Hundreds digit:**\n\nFor the hundreds digit, each digit appears in a block of 1000 numbers, but since N=488, the hundreds digit can only be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but since N=488, there are none.\n\nSo, hundreds digit: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding it all up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " That's 484 - 4 divided by 10, plus 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, 4 can appear in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are: - 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nBut wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, for the hundreds place, 4 can appear in numbers from 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many 8's are there? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, 8 can appear in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such ranges there are: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n\nBut wait, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges are full (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10 numbers, and then 480-488 with 9 numbers. So, total 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check. From 80-89: 10 numbers\nFrom 180-189: 10\nFrom 280-289:10\nFrom 380-389:10\nFrom 480-488:9\n\nSo, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, for the hundreds place, 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such blocks are there? From 0 to 488, the blocks are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. In each of these blocks, the tens place is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, how many complete blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, and 300-399: 340-349. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 numbers. Now, the last block is 400-488. In this block, the tens place is 4 from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, and then from 410-419, etc., but wait, no, in the 400-488 block, the tens place is 4 only from 400-409. So that's another 10 numbers. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10, making it 5 blocks? Wait, no, because 400-488 is the fifth block, but the tens digit is 4 only in 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 4 blocks (each 10 numbers) plus 10 in 400-409, so 4*10 +10=50? Wait, no, because from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. In each of the first four blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So that's 4*10=40. Then in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (400-409). So total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50. So 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. So from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. So each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99; 99+89=188. So total 4's:188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189,..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many complete blocks and partial blocks. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So in the tens place, how many 8's? For the first four blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), each contributes 10 numbers. So that's 4*10=40. Then in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) =90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** No 8's appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. Let's count each set: - 40-49: 10 numbers (40 to 49 inclusive). - 140-149: 10 numbers. - 240-249: 10 numbers. - 340-349: 10 numbers. - 440-449: 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: How many numbers here? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 4 sets with 10 each and one set with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

    "text": " So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I should add 1 to my initial calculation. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 484 is within 480-489, it's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so it's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? Let's see: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except maybe the last one. Let's check each: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, so numbers are 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last. Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). So, for the tens place, we have 4 ranges with 10 numbers each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4*10=40, and the last range 480-488 contributing 9. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. Total: 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That's correct. So, yes, 98 8's. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " That's 484 - 4 divided by 10, which is 480/10 = 48, plus 1 gives 49. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again. The number of terms in the sequence from 4 to 484 with a common difference of 10 is given by ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the numbers 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4.

So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). Now, 400-488: the next would be 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 are present, which is 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs only 9 times. So, how many ranges? Let me see: 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and 1 range with 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 4 and ending at 484. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This results in:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is:\n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\nAdding these together, the total number of 4's is:\n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8 and ending at 488. This results in:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9 numbers, totaling:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\nThere are no 8's in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.\n\nAdding these together, the total number of 8's is:\n\\[\n49 + 49 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\n\\[\n188 \\text{ (number of 4's)} - 98 \\text{ (number of 8's)} = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's 49 times because starting from 0, it's every 10th number. Wait, no, actually, starting from 4, which is the first occurrence, then 14 is the second, and so on. So, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? Let me think: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers in each of these ranges. Each range has 10 numbers, except possibly the last one if it exceeds 488. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? Let's calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. However, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the first four ranges have 10 each, and the last one has 9. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place of 4's, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. That's correct. Units place for 4's: from 4,14,...484, which is 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place is 49, as from 8,18,...488, which is 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** \n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. \n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges.\n   - Number of terms: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of '8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** \n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four ranges have 10 each, last range has 9.\n   - Number of terms: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - No page numbers from 800-899 exist.\n   - Number of terms: 0.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's 484 - 4 divided by 10, which is 480/10 = 48, plus 1 gives 49. Wait, so maybe I should use a different approach. The formula for counting digits in a specific place is to take the higher digits, the current digit, and the lower digits. For the units place, it's (n divided by 10) times 1, but I think I'm complicating it. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10th number after that. So, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many terms is that? The last term is 484. The sequence is 4 + 10*(k-1) = 484. So, 10*(k-1) = 480, so k-1 = 48, so k = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting how many times 4 appears in the tens place. This would be numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-99, 40-49 is one block (10 numbers). Then 140-149 is another, 240-249 another, 340-349 another, and 440-449 another. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, but let's see. The numbers ending with 8 from 1 to 488. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The last number is 488. So, using the same approach as before, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + 10*(k-1) = 488. So, 10*(k-1) = 480, so k-1 = 48, so k = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, numbers where the tens digit is 8. These are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place. Let me count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, let me check: from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, yes. 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only in the number 800-899, but since the book is only up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, the 4 can appear in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 would be up to 449, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check. From 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Then 140-149: another 10, so 20. 240-249: 30. 340-349: 40. 440-449: 50. So yes, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, then 401, 402, ..., up to 488. So, yes, 89 numbers. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: another 10, so 20. 280-289: 30. 380-389: 40. Wait, but 480-489 would be another range, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. So, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so in the tens place, each of these has an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 more 8's. So, total in the tens place: 40 (from the first four ranges) + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check again. The first four ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can only have an 8 if the number is in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 188. Total 8's: 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds:89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because when counting the hundreds place for 4's, I went from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. That seems right. Units place for 4's: 49, correct. For 8's, units:49, tens:49. Wait, but in the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 except the last one, which contributes 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, total 8's:98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 4's, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Number of 4's: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 8's, and the last range contributes 9.\n   - Number of 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's 49 numbers because from 4 to 484, each step is 10, so (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 up to page 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNext, I need to count the number of times the digit 8 appears. Again, I'll check each digit place separately.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same method as before: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, from 400-488: The next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the hundreds place starting at 400, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences (pages go up to 488).\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, in the 40-49 range, each number has a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but wait: the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's okay. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks each contribute 10, and the last block contributes 9. So total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so actually, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range, and 494 would be beyond 488, so maybe I should check up to 488. Let me recalculate: The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. In each group, the units digit is 4 once. So, 48 times. But wait, in the 48th group, which is 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so the 480-488 group includes 484 as the 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, when I thought earlier, I considered 484 as the 49th occurrence. So, which is correct? Let me list a few: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. But since 484 is within 488, that should be correct. So, maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach. So, perhaps the correct count is 49 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, so the count is 49. Okay, so units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're dealing with three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit starts from 1. So, let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. How many blocks is that? 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks give 50 occurrences. But let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's see how many complete blocks there are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: Here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9.\n\nSo, the first four blocks are complete, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block contributes 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 40+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would occur in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98.

Let me check with smaller numbers to confirm. For example, from 1 to 20: 4,14,24. Wait, 24 is beyond 20, so actually, from 1-20, there are two 4's in the units place. Using the formula: (20 - 4)/10 + 1 = 16/10 +1 = 1.6 +1=2.6, which doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the formula isn't correct. Alternatively, the number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if the digit is <= N mod 10 else 0). Let me try that. For units place 4: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10=8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1. So total units place 4's: 48 +1=49. Okay, that makes sense. So units place has 49 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place can have 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let's see how many such sets there are. Each set contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. The highest such number before 488 is 440-449, because 450-459 would have 5 in the tens place, but 450 is beyond 449. Wait, no, 440-449 is the last set before 450. So how many sets are there? The first set is 40-49 (40 to 49), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So total 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check the last set. 440-449: 449 is less than 488, so yes. So total 5 sets, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. So total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula as before: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10=8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1. So units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. Wait, but 480-489: 480 is within 488, but 489 is beyond 488. So the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many sets there are. The first set is 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: that's 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488-480=8, so 8+1=9. So the last set has 9 numbers. So how many full sets do we have? The first four sets: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389: each has 10 numbers, so 4 sets *10=40. The last set: 480-488: 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in sets like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in sets like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full set contributes 10 occurrences, with the last set (480-488) contributing 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's 49 numbers because from 4 to 484, each step is 10, so (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, 240 to 249, 340 to 349, and 440 to 449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440 to 449 is within the range. Let's count how many numbers in each set. Each set (40-49, 140-149, etc.) has 10 numbers. How many such sets are there? From 0 to 488, the tens place cycles every 100. So, 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 400 to 488 is correct. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484: 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, total 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 is the last page. So, starting at 8, each step is 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's see: Each set (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers. How many such sets are there? From 0 to 488, the tens place cycles every 100. So, 80-89 is the first set, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, for the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each has 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 =40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in the tens place is 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. For 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The formula is floor((488 -4)/10) +1= floor(484/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 sets, 5x10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Now, 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. How many? Let's see: 8 to 488, step 10. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4x10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " That's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, the last occurrence is 488. Let's find how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, for the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) each have 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, the last block has 9 numbers. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences (pages go up to 488).\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me correct that. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place can have 4 in positions like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 goes up to 449, but the book has 488 pages, so 440-449 is within 488. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. However, wait, does 440-449 include 440, which is within 488? Yes, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. For the first four ranges (80-89, etc.), each contributes 10 numbers. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many sets there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. How many such sets are there? Well, the first set is in the 40s, which is 40-49, then each subsequent hundred has another set. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only interested in the hundreds digit being 4, so each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 full sets of 10, and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting in ranges, I might have missed something. Let me verify the hundreds place for 4's: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, correct. For 8's in the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. Units place for both digits: 49 each, which makes sense because they both cycle every 10 numbers. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but let me think again: in the hundreds place for 4's, it's 89, but in the hundreds place for 8's, it's 0. So, that's a big difference there. So, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 times**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 numbers (480-488) = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98 times**\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, 240 to 249, 340 to 349, and 440 to 449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has a 40-49 range. Wait, 400-449 is 50 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, the last range is 440-449, right? So, from 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: 10. 240-249:10. 340-349:10. 440-449:10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Wait, but that's not just the hundreds digit; each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. But wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 ranges, so 4*10=40 times. Wait, but does 480-489 exist? Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of the book. So, does 480-489 count? Well, the tens place is 8, so numbers from 480 to 489 would have 8 in the tens place. But since the book ends at 488, the last number is 488, which is included. So, from 480-488, how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, that's an additional 9 numbers in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me check that again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 440-449. Let's count how many such sets there are. Each set (like 40-49) has 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So, that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences. But wait, I should check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many? Let's see: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. So, 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, total is 4 full sets (each 10) and 1 partial set with 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, so 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the 4's in the hundreds place, I considered 400-488, which is 89 numbers. That seems right because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4\u00d710 +9=49. That seems correct too. So, I think the difference is 90.

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me confirm. From 4 to 484, the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many complete blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is within 1-99. The second block is 140-149, which is within 100-199. The third is 240-249 (200-299), the fourth is 340-349 (300-399), and the fifth is 440-449 (400-488). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. Now, how many blocks are there? Each block contributes 10 occurrences. So, 5 blocks would give 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are valid. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many blocks there are. 80-89 is within 1-99, 180-189 within 100-199, 280-289 within 200-299, 380-389 within 300-399. Now, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), right? So, how does that affect the count? Each complete block (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, but the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, how many complete blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 complete blocks and one incomplete. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98=90? Wait, 188-98 is indeed 90. Hmm, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, inclusive. The number of numbers is 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. Now, for the 8's in the tens place: I had 4 complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and the last block 480-488 contributing 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. Units place: same as 4's, 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again. When counting the 4's in the units place, I had 49 numbers, but wait, 488 is included, so does that affect the count? Let me see: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. That's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Each block of 100 numbers has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 numbers.

But wait, the last block is only up to 488, so does that affect the count? Let me check: In the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, each block contributes 10. So, total tens place 4's: 5 blocks * 10 = 50. Wait, but wait, from 0-99 is actually 1-99, right? Because page 1 is the first page, but page 0 doesn't exist. So, does 40-49 exist? Yes, because page 40 is valid. So, maybe it's okay. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is only 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's check each block: - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). - 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). - 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). - 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in this block, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks * 10 (for 80-89, etc.) plus 9 for 480-488. That's 4*10=40 + 9=49. Wait, but let me recount: from 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify the counts again. For 4's: units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. The blocks are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. In each of the first four blocks, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. In the last block, 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 blocks *10=50. Correct. For 8's in the tens place, the last block is 400-488, which has 480-488, so 9 numbers, not 10. So, 4 blocks *10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " That's 484 - 4 = 480, and 480 / 10 = 48, but since we include both endpoints, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The number of terms in the sequence from 4 to 484 with a common difference of 10 is given by ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1 to 488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each hundred, the 40-49 range contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for the first four hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1 to 488, we have 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488)\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 48 in steps of 10 gives 49 terms. Wait, no, actually, 484 is the 49th term because (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one set, then 140-149 is another, 240-249 another, 340-349 another, and 440-449 another. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 count fully? Since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are present. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Let me count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: since 488 is the last page, this range is 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, so 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. Let me confirm: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. And for the tens place for 8's, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total 8's in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) is 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. Units place for 8's: 49. So, 98 total 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, 440-449 is the fifth set, and 440 is the first number in that set. But since the book ends at 488, 449 is still within the book, so it's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 = 9). So, for the hundreds place, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus one if the last number in the units place is 4. Wait, but 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, the number of 4's in the tens place is 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first is 8, the last is 488. How many such numbers? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges are there up to 488. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. But wait, 380-389 is within 488, so that's fine. However, is there another range beyond 380-389? The next would be 480-489, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the tens place, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but only 9 numbers. So, I think I need to adjust. So, up to 380-389: 4 ranges, 40 numbers. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such sets are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 count? The book goes up to 488, so yes, 440-449 is within the range. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 count? The book goes up to 488, so yes, 480-488 is part of this. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: How many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, total in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is in the first hundred, 180-189 in the second, 280-289 in the third, 380-389 in the fourth, and 480-488 in the fifth. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets x 10 + 1 set x 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49. Total 8's: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 8's in the tens place. Let me check again. The tens place for 8's: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. That's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I think I might have missed something. Let me check the hundreds place again for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place.\n   - Number of sets: 5 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Number of 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each hundred (except the last) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place.\n   - Number of sets: 5, but the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers.\n   - Number of 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488. So, there are 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each block gives 10 4's, so that's 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 up to 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, let's add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same method as before: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many blocks are there? Since the book ends at 488, the last block is 380-389. So, there are 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). Each gives 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99.

From 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times.

Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks give 5*10=50 occurrences. Wait, but the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, starting from 400 up to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189 is another. Similarly, 280-289 and 380-389. That's 4 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 occurrences. Wait, but the last block is 380-389, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 40 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds places with 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (40) = 89. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: units:49, tens:40, hundreds:0. Total 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Yes, because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. And for the tens place of 4's, I had 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each contributing 10, so 50. Units place:49. So, yes, 188 fours. For 8's, units:49, tens:40, so 89. So, the difference is 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
