    "text": " The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: one block (40-49). From 100-199: another block (140-149). Similarly, from 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the last page is 488, so the units digit is 8 in 488. So, how many such numbers? Starting from 8, each step of 10. The last one is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 exist? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 would be the tens block, but only up to 488. So, let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9 =49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, that's 90. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, let me check the last block. 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, I'm only counting the hundreds digit here, which is 4 for all these numbers. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The last occurrence is at 488. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these blocks. Each block is 10 numbers, so 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, and so on. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, so 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is beyond 389, so 400-488 doesn't have a block where the tens digit is 8 because 480-489 would be the next, but 488 is within that. Wait, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but 488 is part of that. So, 480-489 is another block, making it 5 blocks. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 50 = 99. So, there are 99 eights in total. Now, the difference is number of fours minus number of eights: 188 - 99 = 89. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89). Total 188. For eights: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (0). Total 99. So, 188 - 99 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For the tens place of eights, I initially thought 4 blocks but realized it's 5 because 480-489 is another block. So, 50 eights in the tens place. Units place for eights is 49, same as fours. So, 49 + 50 = 99 eights. So, 188 fours minus 99 eights equals 89 more fours than eights. Therefore, the answer is 89.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of terms = ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of terms = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489.  \n   Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 99.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 99 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " That's 484 - 4 divided by 10 plus 1, which is (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the hundreds digits can be 0 (for 1-99), 1, 2, 3, or 4. But 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks? For hundreds digit 0: 40-49 (1 block). Hundreds digit 1: 140-149 (1 block). Similarly, hundreds digits 2,3,4: each has one block. So that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. But each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But let's check using the same method as before: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 (1 block), 180-189 (1), 280-289 (1), 380-389 (1). So, 4 blocks. Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 380-389 fall within 488? Yes, 389 is less than 488. So, 4 blocks, 40 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 +40=89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) -89 (eights) = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 40 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 40 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\n\\boxed{99}"

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? 0-99: 1 range, 100-199: 1, 200-299:1, 300-399:1, 400-488:1. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is only 10 numbers, right? Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but I should check if 488 is included. Yes, because 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many times. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. Let me count how many ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, for the tens place, we have 4 full ranges of 10 numbers each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial range of 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, let's see how many full ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is fine.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book's pages. Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, that's 5 ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10. So, let me correct that. The first four ranges (80-89, etc.) each have 10 numbers, but the last one (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, the total for the tens place is 4 ranges * 10 + 1 range * 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8 in units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, there are 98 eights printed. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since pages don't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The difference between each is 10, so the count is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4, so each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. Let's calculate how many. The first is 8, last is 488. The count is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the tens place, how many times does 8 appear? Let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges. The first four are full ranges with 10 numbers each, and the last one is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, 8's appear 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Number of ranges: 5 (each contributing 10 numbers).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Number of full ranges: 4 (each contributing 10 numbers).\n   - Partial range 480-488 contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in page numbers up to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 occurrences. Wait, but the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. Solving: 10*(n-1) = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count the ranges: 80-89 is within 488, 180-189 is within, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, 480-489: but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, does that count as a full range? No, because 489 is beyond 488. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me check that again. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So total is 40+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488?

Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Let's calculate how many terms there are. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range contributes 10 numbers. Let's count how many ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next range, but since the book only goes up to 488, we need to check if 480-488 is included. 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, for 480-488, only 9 numbers have 8 in the tens place. Therefore, total in the tens place is 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check that again. The first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total is 40+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

    "text": " That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 484, there are 485 numbers, and every 10th number has a 4 in the units place. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, for each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one number with a 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last set is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the 48th set ends at 480, and then we have 481-488, which is 8 more numbers. So in the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 more at 484. So that's 49 4's in the units place. Wait, no, because 484 is within 481-488, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 (from 1-480) +1 (484) =49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So how many such blocks are there? The first block is 40-49, which is the first set. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 x 10 =50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So total tens place 4's:50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. So how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So total 4's:188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: from 1-488, how many numbers end with 8? It's every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th number because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So units place 8's:49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So how many blocks are there? 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's:0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (from 1-480: 48 times, and 484: 1 time).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:**\n- Units: 49 + Tens: 50 + Hundreds: 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (from 1-488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last, which contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**\n- Units: 49 + Tens: 49 + Hundreds: 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's (188) - Number of 8's (98) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " The number of terms in this sequence can be found by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. However, I need to check if 440-449 is within the 488-page limit. Since 449 is less than 488, it's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, in the hundreds place, only the first digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 89 numbers. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 ranges * 10 = 40. The last range is 480-488, which has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None (pages \u2264 488) \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. From 1 to 488, we have four full blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, the last block is 401-500, but our book only goes up to 488. So, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in the 400s, which is 10 numbers (440-449). Wait, no, actually, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But from 400-409, the tens digit is 0, so 400-409 don't count. So, in the 400s, only 440-449 have the tens digit as 4, which is 10 numbers. Therefore, total tens place 4's: 40 (from the first four blocks) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Wait, but let me double-check. From 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10. 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10. 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10. 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find the number of terms, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count: From 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10. 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10. 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10. 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " The difference between 484 and 4 is 480, and since each step is 10, the number of terms is (480 / 10) + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, from 100-400, there are four blocks (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499). Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last block is 400-488. Let me calculate each block: - 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. - 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. - 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. - 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, does 440-449 fall entirely within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 40 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: Units place: 49, Tens place: 40, Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's = 49 + 40 + 89 = 178. Now, I'll do the same for 8's. Let me count the number of 8's in each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. Let's calculate how many: The first is 8, last is 488. The difference is 488 - 8 = 480, divided by 10 gives 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-488. Let's check each block: - 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. - 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. - 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. - 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first three blocks give 3 * 10 = 30, and the last block gives 9. So, total 30 + 9 = 39 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding them up: Units place: 49, Tens place: 39, Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's = 49 + 39 + 0 = 88.

    "text": " The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: from 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449. Does 449 exceed 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so it's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, no. Actually, in the hundreds place, each number contributes one 4. So, from 400 to 488, every number has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. For example, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these blocks. From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks. Each block contributes 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Wait, but 480-489 would be another block, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, from 480-488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? 480-488 is 9 numbers, but only 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. Wait, no: 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) contributing 40, plus 9 from 480-488. Wait, no. Let me clarify: in the tens place, the 8's appear in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 5 blocks, but the last one has only 9 numbers. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last partial block, so 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 blocks, but actually, it's 5 blocks because 480-488 is another block where the tens digit is 8. So, 5 blocks, but the last one has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10=40, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9. So total 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's. So, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each of these is 10 apart, starting at 4. So, the number of 4's in the units place is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that seems correct because 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484, so n = (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block would be 440-449. Let's see how many full blocks there are. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. The next is 140-149, another 10, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does the 440-449 block go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This would be from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only counting the hundreds place digit, which is 4 for each of these numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400-488 is indeed 89 numbers, so yes, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks and the partial one. The first four blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 numbers. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last partial block, totaling 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, so the answer would be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place of 4, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. Units place for 4: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers, correct. For 8's: units place, 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each full block is 10, so 4 blocks give 40, and 480-488 is 9, so total 49. That's correct. So, yes, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't include that. Let's count how many such sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and each set contributes one 4 in the tens place for each number. So, for each hundred, there's one set. From 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 4's in the tens place. But wait, from 401-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's. - 180-189: 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's. - 280-289: 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's. - 380-389: 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's. - 480-488: 9 numbers, contributing 9 8's. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 8's. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89, that's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. Similarly for 180-189, etc. But 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488, so we have 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total 10*4 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 8's. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, since the book goes up to 488, the last block is 440-449, because 488 is less than 500. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (1 block) From 100-199: 140-149 (1 block) From 200-299: 240-249 (1 block) From 300-399: 340-349 (1 block) From 400-488: 440-449 (1 block) So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure. The last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so yes, that's included. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, 50 total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. Now, does 480-489 exist? Yes, since the book has 488 pages, so 480-488 is part of the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so how many are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the hundreds place, let's see: 0-99: 80-89 (1 block) 100-199: 180-189 (1 block) 200-299: 280-289 (1 block) 300-399: 380-389 (1 block) 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page) So, that's 4 full blocks (each with 10 occurrences) and 1 partial block with 9 occurrences. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Next, I'll count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. To find the number of terms, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 occur? Yes, but 480-489 is within 488, so we include 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 is actually 10 numbers, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last number is 488. So, in the tens place, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, how many full blocks of 10 are there? Let me think. The first four blocks (80-89, etc.) are full, each contributing 10 numbers. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total occurrences in the tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last partial block, totaling 49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high. Let me go through the counts again. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total 188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me check that again. In the tens place, the blocks are: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 full blocks and one partial block. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many terms? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49 (page 40 to 49), the next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and the last one would be 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. In the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 end with an 8? Yes, 488 is the last page. So, the last occurrence in the units place is 488. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me check how many complete blocks there are. The first block is 80-89 (8 occurrences? Wait, no, each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and then 480-488 is 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, the first four blocks contribute 4*10=40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me make sure. 80-89: 10 numbers, tens digit 8. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 eights printed. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding them up: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's see how many blocks there are: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: Units: 49, Tens: 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the 4's in the tens place, I considered 5 blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block (400-488) has 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, 50. That's correct. For the 8's in the tens place, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 90.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488 => 10(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the hundreds range. Let me check each range. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, each of the first four ranges gives 10 numbers, and the last range gives 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, is that correct? Let me think: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, etc.) has a 40-49 block. How many hundreds are there up to 488? Well, 488 is in the 400-499 range, but since the book ends at 488, the 440-449 block is complete, and the next block would be 450-459, etc., but 488 is less than 499, so the 400-449 block is complete, but 450-488 is partial. Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, the 4 can appear in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in numbers ending with 8: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place for 8. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So that's 4 blocks with 10 each and 1 block with 9. So total 4*10 +9=40+9=49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 8's. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n  \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So starting from 4, each step adds 10. The number of terms is given by ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So there are 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many complete blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. The next is 140-149, another 10, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, the last block is 440-449. How many blocks are there? From 0 to 400, there are 5 blocks (0-9, 10-19, ..., 400-409). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. So, for each hundred, we have 10 fours in the tens place. So 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10 fours. So total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me recount. The tens digit cycles every 100, so in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times. So from 1-100, 40-49: 10 fours. From 101-200, 140-149: 10 fours. From 201-300, 240-249: 10 fours. From 301-400, 340-349: 10 fours. That's 4*10=40 fours. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. So that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, in the hundreds digit, how many times does 4 appear? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 +1 = 89). But the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499. But since our book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, let me sum up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89= 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The difference between each term is 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. So 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count each block. From 1-100: 80-89: 10 eights. From 101-200: 180-189:10 eights. From 201-300:280-289:10 eights. From 301-400:380-389:10 eights. From 401-488:480-488:9 eights (since 489 is beyond 488). So total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So 4*10 +9=40+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. So there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. So 9 eights. So yes, 49 eights in tens place. So total eights:49+49=98. So the difference is 188-98=90. So the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n     - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n     - Each block contributes 10 fours.

    "text": " That's 484 - 4 divided by 10 plus 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 = 480/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check each place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89 is the first, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences. Wait, but 80-89 is within 1-488, so that's valid. Similarly, 180-189, etc., up to 380-389. But wait, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Wait, but in the tens place, 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place. So, actually, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, that's 5 sets. But 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, the first four sets are complete (each 10 numbers), and the fifth set is partial with 9 numbers. So, for the tens place: 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, making it 49 occurrences. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now I'm getting 49. Let me double-check. The tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

There are 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens place 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many. The last occurrence is at 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 contributes 10 numbers. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. From 401-488, the tens place 8 occurs in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me confirm: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, yes, 9. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which would be from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The ranges are 40-49 (which is up to 49), 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is a partial range because 488 is the last page. So, let's calculate each range. a. 80-89: 10 numbers. b. 180-189: 10 numbers. c. 280-289: 10 numbers. d. 380-389: 10 numbers. e. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers). So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer would be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for 8's. When counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five ranges. The first four are full decades (10 numbers each), and the last one is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, I had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That also seems correct. Hmm, but wait, in the 4's hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400+1=89. That's correct. So, adding up, 49+50+89=188 for 4's. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me think again. Wait, when counting the tens place for 8's, in the range 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. Similarly, in the units place, 8 appears every 10 numbers, so from 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so that's (488-8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. So, I think the calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place. 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 48, there are 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges would give 50 fours. But wait, does the last range go up to 449? Since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is within the book, so that's 10 fours. So, total in tens place is 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4 ranges \u00d710 = 40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, let me check again. Units: 49, Tens: 49, so total 98 eights. Now, subtracting the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of such numbers: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of such numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of such numbers: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four ranges: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Last range (480-488): 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, 4 can appear in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. 4 can appear in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that block. Let's see: Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks? From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, does 480-488 include 9 numbers? Let me check: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers because 488-480=8, so 8+1=9. So, for the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, I can think about each digit position again to confirm. For 4's: units place, every 10 numbers, so 4,14,...484. As 484 is the last one, so (484-4)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each block except the last has 10, the last has 9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, yes, 98 8's. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " The difference between each number is 10, so the count is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. The count here is from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, so how many are there? Let's calculate: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 ranges with 10 each and one range with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488. Let's count how many full blocks there are. Each block is 100 pages, and in each block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). How many full hundreds are there? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499). Wait, but 400-499 includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 in 400-488 is only up to 488. Let me see: For the tens place, the number of times 4 appears is: - In 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 times. - In 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 times. - In 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 times. - In 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 times. - In 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so 440-449 is within that. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50. But wait, 400-488 is only up to 488, but 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so yes, 10 more. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me confirm: 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10. That's 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. Setting equal to 488: 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488 \u2192 (n-1)*10 = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks and partial blocks we have. Each block is 100 pages. So: - 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 times. - 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 times. - 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 times. - 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 times. - 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 here, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but in the tens place, each number from 480-488 has an 8 in the tens place. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, for the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9 =40 +9=49. Wait, but let me think again. For each hundred block, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, except the last block, which is only up to 488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. How many such sets are there? Each hundred has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So from 1-99, there's 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199, 140-149 (another 10). From 200-299, 240-249 (another 10). From 300-399, 340-349 (another 10). From 400-488, 440-449 (another 10). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. Wait, but let me check the last set. 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, each set contributes 10 except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So yes, 49 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high. Let me recount the 4's and 8's. For 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for 8's, the tens place goes up to 488, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 in the tens place for 8's. So, 49+49=98. So, yes, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the units place for 4's, I had 49 numbers. Similarly, for 8's, units place also 49. Tens place for 4's: 50, and for 8's: 49. Hundreds place: 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49+0=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, I might have included numbers beyond the book's page count. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488-400+1=89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, yes, 49 (units) + 49 (tens) =98 8's. So, the difference is indeed 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let me count these ranges. - 40-49: That's 10 numbers. - 140-149: Another 10. - 240-249: Another 10. - 340-349: Another 10. - 440-449: Another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, totaling 50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449, which is fine because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same method: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 4 full ranges of 10 and one partial range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " So starting from 4, each step adds 10. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. We want 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. Let's solve for n: (n-1)*10 \u2264 484 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48.4 \u2192 n \u2264 49.4. So n is 49. Wait, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me recalculate. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of times 4 is in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, for each ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. How many such tens are there? From 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Divided by 10, that's 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490) and then 8 more numbers (491-498). But wait, 488 is less than 490, so actually, the number of full decades is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So in each of the 48 full decades, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), does the units digit 4 appear? Let's see: 484 is within this range, so that's one more occurrence. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5*10 = 50 times. Wait, but the last range is 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's fine. So total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, but with 8's. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1 to 488. Each 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, as before, there are 48 full decades (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full decade, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the last 8 numbers (481-488), does 8 appear in the units place? Yes, at 488. So that's one more. So units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This happens in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10. From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So for the last range, it's 9 numbers instead of 10 because 488 is the last page. So total tens place 8's: 4 ranges with 10 each, and 1 range with 9. So 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10.

The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same method: 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = 10(n-1) => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count each block: From 1-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Finally, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

    "text": " The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many full sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets there are. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 4 sets with 10 numbers each and 1 set with 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking 4's: units: 4,14,...,484 \u2192 49 numbers. Tens: 40-49, 140-149, etc., 5 sets \u00d710 = 50. Hundreds: 400-488 \u2192 89 numbers. Total 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Checking 8's: units: 8,18,...,488 \u2192 49 numbers. Tens: 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, +9=49. So, 49 in tens place. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct. For 8's, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, which is correct. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 in tens place. So, 49+49=98 8's. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Number of 4's:**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n     - Number of 4's = ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit 4 appears in every block of 100 numbers, specifically in 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n     - Number of blocks = 5 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n     - Each block contributes 10 numbers, so total = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** The digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488.\n     - Number of pages = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Number of 8's:**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - Number of 8's = ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit 8 appears in every block of 100 numbers, specifically in 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n     - Full blocks: 4 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 numbers = 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - Partial block (400-488): 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n     - Total = 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - Number of 8's = 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's = 188.\n   - Number of 8's = 98.\n   - Difference = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The number of terms can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the last block would be 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each block contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 blocks contribute 5*10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so all 5 blocks are valid. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 49 times. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. How many terms? Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers (80-89). - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, so 4's occur 188 times and 8's occur 98 times. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me just double-check my counts for 4's and 8's. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 484, the units digit cycles every 10, so (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated by (N // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >= 4. Wait, but N is 488 here. So, for units digit 4, the number of times is floor(488 / 10) = 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then check if the last partial ten has a 4. Since 488 ends with 8, the last full ten is 480, so the units digit 4 appears 48 times. Wait, but when I count from 4 to 484, that's 49 times. I'm confused now. Let me list a few: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49, that's one set, then 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 < 488. So, the tens digit 4 appears 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers here? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's count how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's calculate each range: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would be in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is within that, so yes, it's 10 numbers. So 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each contributes one 4. So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Let me check each range: - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 100-199: 180-189 (10). - 200-299: 280-289 (10). - 300-399: 380-389 (10). - 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So that's 4 ranges with 10 each and one with 9. So total tens place 8's: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking 4's: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So that's right. For 8's in the tens place, I had 4 ranges with 10 each and one with 9. Wait, from 400-488, the 8 in the tens place is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So that's correct. So 49 8's in tens place. So, total 8's are 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. \u2192 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488 \u2192 0 times.\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, and 488 is beyond that, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400-488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: Does 480-489 exist? 480-489 is within 400-488, but 489 is beyond 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, that's 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, let me double-check: From 0-99: 80-89:10. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, with 5 such ranges.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers except the last, which contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each step increases by 10, so from 4 to 484 is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one set. Then, 140-149: second set. 240-249: third set. 340-349: fourth set. 440-449: fifth set. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. But wait, I need to check if 440-449 is within the 488-page limit. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all these ranges are valid. So, 50 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400-488. Let me think: the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these ranges. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next range, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, and one partial range (480-488) contributing 9 eights. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights printed. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages don't reach 800.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
