    "text": " Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 -480 +1=9. So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me try another approach: instead of counting each digit position separately, maybe I can use a formula or a different method to verify. For example, for each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. Let me try that. **Counting 4's:**\n- Units place: For each complete set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 four, so 48 fours. But wait, the last partial set is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's an extra four in the units place. So, 48 +1=49 fours in units place. Correct.\n- Tens place: For each set of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are 488 numbers, so 4 full hundreds (1-400) and 88 extra numbers (401-488). So, in each hundred, 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many tens places are 4? From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours:40+10=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- Units place: Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 eight, so 48 eights. The last partial set is 480-488, which includes 488, so that's an extra eight in the units place. So, 48+1=49 eights in units place. Correct.\n- Tens place: For each set of 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: As before, no eights here since 800 is beyond 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.

    "text": " Wait, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when I count digits, I might have missed something. Let me try another approach: calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again, but this time more carefully. For 4's: Units place: numbers ending with 4 from 1 to 488. The first is 4, last is 484. The count is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: numbers where the tens digit is 4. These are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks: 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: numbers ending with 8 from 1 to 488. First is 8, last is 488. Count is ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: numbers where the tens digit is 8. These are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, the last block from 480-488 has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.
