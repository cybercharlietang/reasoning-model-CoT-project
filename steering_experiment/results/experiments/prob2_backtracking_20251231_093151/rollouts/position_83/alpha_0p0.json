    "text": " So, 9 eights in the tens place there. So, adding up, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49 in the tens place for 8's. Units place:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digit positions, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately and ensure I'm not missing any. For 4's: Units: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of such numbers is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 484 is included, it's 49. Correct. Tens: For the tens digit being 4, it's every 100 numbers, 10 times each. So, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Up to 440-449, which is within 488. So, 5 sets, 10 each, 50. Correct. Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units: 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, and the last set 480-488 has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds: 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).
