    "text": " So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, total eights in tens place:49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. Let me just think if there's any other way to approach this problem. Alternatively, I could calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units and tens, it's similar for both 4 and 8, except that for 8, the last set in the tens place is cut short because the book ends at 488. But in the units place, 8 appears up to 488, which is fine. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. In the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, while 8 appears 49 times because the last set (480-488) only has 9 numbers instead of 10. In the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, while 8 appears 0 times. So, adding up: 4's:49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188. 8's:49(units)+49(tens)+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488, inclusive).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The last range has 9 numbers instead of 10 because the book ends at 488. Thus, there are 49 occurrences (10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9).\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
