    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the range 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. I need to figure out how many such numbers there are. \n\nThe total number of pages is 488, so the number of complete tens is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). Each complete ten contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the last incomplete ten (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. Does 484 fall into this incomplete ten? Yes, because 484 is within 480-488. So, that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The total number of tens is 48 full tens (1-480) and then 481-488. So in each full ten, there's one 4 in the units place. So 48 full tens give 48 fours. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are.\n\nFrom 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're dealing with page numbers, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the tens digit is 4 in the following ranges:\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So each of these blocks has 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's count them:\n\n1. 40-49: yes\n2. 140-149: yes\n3. 240-249: yes\n4. 340-349: yes\n5. 440-449: yes\n\nSo that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on. The last block is 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's fine. So 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in pages 400-488. So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The hundreds digit is only 4 for numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours.\n\nSo total fours in all digit places: units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So total fours are 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll count the number of 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place. Similar to fours, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So in each block of 10, there's one 8. From 1 to 488, how many complete tens are there? 48 complete tens (1-480), and then 481-488. Each complete ten has one 8 in the units place, so 48 eights. Now, in the last incomplete ten, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more 8. So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in the following ranges:\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488)\n\nWait, so each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 eights each. The last block, 480-488, only has 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, how many eights in the tens place?\n\nFirst four blocks: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Then, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on. 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So yes, 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nSo total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 49, so total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier for fours, I had 188 fours. So the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nStarting with fours:\n\nUnits place: 49 fours. That seems right because 48 full tens and one more in 484.\n\nTens place: 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Plus, wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So 50 fours.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours from 400-488. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, plus one more in 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 eights, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the tens place correctly for eights. From 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. That's 40. Then 480-488: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So 9 eights. So 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the tens place, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place for fours, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 fours. That seems right.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. So the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every block of 10 numbers contributes one 4.\n   - There are 48 full tens (1-480), contributing 48 fours.\n   - In 481-488, 484 adds one more 4.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 each contribute 10 fours.\n   - Total: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing one 4.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 48 full tens contribute 48 eights.\n   - 488 adds one more 8.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10 eights.\n   - 480-488 contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No numbers with hundreds digit 8 in 1-488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll do this by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the last partial set (481-488), there's a 484, which adds another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, the last block is 440-449. Since our book goes up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 1-488, so it's okay. So, tens place 4's: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. \n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets and 8 extra numbers. Each set contributes one 8, so 48 times. In the last partial set (481-488), there's 488, which adds another 8 in the units place. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9. So, let's count: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. That's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place 8's: 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full sets (48) + 1 in 484 = 49\n- Tens: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full sets (48) + 1 in 488 = 49\n- Tens: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in 480-488 = 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, it's 4; 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, in the partial block from 481-488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 484 is within this range, which adds another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, for every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? That's 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the remaining pages are from 401-488. In the tens place, 400-409 would have 4 in the tens place, but 401-409 is part of the 400 block, which is the fifth block. Wait, no, 401-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but our book stops at 488. So, in the tens place for 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, up to 8 for 481-490. But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449. So, that's another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that adds 10 more 4's in the tens place. So, total tens place 4's are 40 (from the first four blocks) + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The first four blocks (1-400) contribute 4 * 10 = 40 4's in the tens place. Then, in the range 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that's 10 more, making it 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's are units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. As before, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488, so that's 48 8's. The partial block from 481-488 includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For every block of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are four complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, in the range 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nFinally, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units place: 48 full blocks give 48, plus 488 gives one more, so 49. Tens place: 4 blocks give 40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, making 49. Hundreds place: 0. So total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting for 4's in the tens place. I had 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, making 50. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, 4 blocks give 40, and then in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, making 49. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place, 488 is included, so units digit 8 occurs once more, making 49. So, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds: total 98 8's.\n\n4's: 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds: total 188.\n\n188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute 1 '4'. With 48 full decades (1-480) and one partial (481-488), we get 48 + 1 = 49 '4's.\n- **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers contribute 10 '4's. Four full centuries (1-400) give 40 '4's. The range 401-488 adds another 10 '4's in 440-449, totaling 50 '4's.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 each have a '4', contributing 89 '4's.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to '4's, we get 48 + 1 = 49 '8's.\n- **Tens place:** Four full centuries give 40 '8's. The range 401-488 adds 9 '8's in 480-488, totaling 49 '8's.\n- **Hundreds place:** No '8's appear here.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Units place: I need to find how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. For every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each of the 48 blocks, 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more.

For every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so there are four full hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. Wait, actually, 488 is in the 400-488 range, so that's the fifth hundred. But let me think carefully.\n\nWait, from 1 to 488, the hundreds are 0-99 (which is 100 numbers), 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So that's five blocks, but the last one is only up to 488. Now, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Then, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 appears in the 440-449 range, which is 10 times. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 times. So total tens place 4's are 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 only in the 400-488 range. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? It's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in terms of the hundreds digit, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, then 401, up to 488. So yes, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1 to 488. Similar to the 4's, for every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place. Again, for every 100 numbers, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). From 1 to 488, how many hundreds? As before, five blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times? Wait, no. Wait, in the tens place, 8 is in 480-489, but our range is up to 488, so from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all those numbers. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. Wait, but wait, actually, in the tens place, each block is 100, so in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is only in 480-489, but since we're stopping at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this block. So total tens place 8's: 40 (from first four blocks) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the 400-488 block, the tens digit 8 is from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the 800-899 range, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, so the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the tens place for 4's, I considered the 400-488 block as having 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (440-449). That's correct because 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, hence 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me think about the units place again. For both 4 and 8, I considered that in each block of 10, the digit appears once, and then in the last partial block, once more. So, for 488 pages, the units digit 4 and 8 each appear 49 times. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place for 8. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so that's zero. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for 4 again. I had 4 blocks of 100 each contributing 10 times, so 40, and then the 400-488 block contributing another 10 times, so 50 total. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 4 blocks contributing 10 each, so 40, and then the 400-488 block contributing 9, so 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers or miss any ranges.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: every 10 numbers, so 48 full blocks (1-480) contribute 48, and 481-488 adds 1 more, total 49.\n- Tens: every 100 numbers, 4 in the tens place 10 times per block. 4 blocks (1-400) contribute 40, and 400-488 contributes another 10 (440-449), total 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: same as 4's, 49 times.\n- Tens: 4 blocks contributing 10 each, 40, and 480-488 contributing 9, total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. Up to 488, there are 48 full blocks (1-480) contributing 48, plus one more in 481-488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every block of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Four blocks (1-400) contribute 40, plus 10 times in 440-449, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4, contributing 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every block of 100, 8 appears 10 times. Four blocks contribute 40, plus 9 times in 480-488, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 never appears in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90. So, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I think this method will help me avoid missing any numbers. So, I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the units place, then the tens place, and finally the hundreds place across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with the units place: For each set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of ten, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit (like 4 or 8) appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and considering the remainder.\n\nWait, but the total number of pages is 488, so let me see. The number of complete tens in 488 is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then there are 8 more pages (481-488). So, for the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place for the complete tens, and then in the incomplete last set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, for the units place, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nIn the complete tens (1-480), each digit appears 48 times, so 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times. Now, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial set, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, total 4's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so they're equal in the units place? Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n\nNow, since we have 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, no, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds plus 88 pages, but let me think about how the tens digit works.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. Therefore, for 4 full hundreds (1-400), each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. Now, the remaining pages are 401-488, which is 88 pages. Let's break this down into tens and units.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410 (but wait, 401-410 is actually 10 numbers: 401,402,...,410. Wait, no, 401-410 would be 10 numbers, but 401 is 401, so the tens digit is 0 for 401-410? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 401 has a tens digit of 0, 410 has a tens digit of 1. Wait, no, 401 is 401, so the tens digit is 0, and 410 is 410, so the tens digit is 1. Wait, actually, the tens digit is determined by the second digit from the right. So, 401 has tens digit 0, 402 has 0, up to 409, then 410 has 1, 411 has 1, etc.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (401-410, 411-420, ..., 481-490). Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so the last partial ten is 481-488. So, each full ten contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is the same. So, in 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; up to 481-490, tens digit is 8. But since we only go up to 488, the last ten is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for those 8 numbers.\n\nWait, so for the tens digit in 401-488, how many times does each digit appear?\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers.\nFrom 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers.\n...\nFrom 481-490: tens digit 8, but only 8 numbers (481-488).\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear?\n\nDigits 0 through 7: each appears 10 times (since each ten is complete except the last one).\nDigit 8: appears 8 times in the last partial ten.\n\nSo, for the tens place in 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450, I think), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). Wait, but let me check: 441-450 is a full ten where the tens digit is 4, so that's 10 times. Similarly, 431-440 would have tens digit 3, etc. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place for the entire book, we have 4 full hundreds (1-400) where each digit appears 40 times, and then 401-488 where digit 4 appears 10 times and digit 8 appears 8 times. So, total for the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\nNumber of 8's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 48 times. So, 4's are more by 2 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\nDigit 1: 100-199, which is 100 numbers, so 100 times.\nDigit 2: 200-299, 100 times.\nDigit 3: 300-399, 100 times.\nDigit 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Wait, 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 does not appear at all because the hundreds digit can't be 8 in this book (since the book only goes up to 488). So, number of 8's in hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, now, let's tally up the total number of 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nFirst, let's sum up the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- For 1-480, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place. So, 4 and 8 each appear 48 times.\n- Then, 481-488: units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place total: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 1-400: each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. So, 4 and 8 each appear 40 times.\n- From 401-488: tens digit cycles through 0-8. Each digit 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n- So, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488).\n- So, total tens place: 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +8=48 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 1-99: no hundreds digit, so 0.\n- 100-199: hundreds digit 1, 100 times.\n- 200-299: hundreds digit 2, 100 times.\n- 300-399: hundreds digit 3, 100 times.\n- 400-488: hundreds digit 4, 89 times.\n- So, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97.\nDifference: 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I was calculating the units place for 481-488, I considered 484 as having a 4 in the units place, which is correct. Similarly, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother check: Let's verify the total number of digits printed. Each page from 1-9 is a single digit, so 9 digits. Pages 10-99 are two digits each, so 90 pages *2=180 digits. Pages 100-488 are three digits each, so 488-99=389 pages, but wait, 100-488 is 389 pages? Wait, 488-100+1=389 pages. So, 389*3=1167 digits. So total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167=1356 digits.\n\nNow, total digits from 1-488: 1356.\n\nNow, let's see if the total number of 4's and 8's makes sense. Each digit 0-9 appears roughly the same number of times, except for the hundreds place which only has 1,2,3,4.\n\nBut let's see: The total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97. So, 188-97=91, which is the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those 89 pages, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's calculate the number of times 4 appears in each place:\n\nUnits: 49\nTens: 50\nHundreds:89\nTotal:188.\n\nSimilarly for 8's:\n\nUnits:49\nTens:48\nHundreds:0\nTotal:97.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97, so the difference is 91. Therefore, there are 91 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed in the page numbers is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0, then 11-20, and so on. In each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each complete set, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 sets would give 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place.\n\nNow, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. So, in the units place, the number of 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 100 pages. For example, from 1-99, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's. There are 4 complete hundreds, so that's 4*10 = 40 4's and 40 8's from the tens place in the complete hundreds.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. Let's see: from 401-488, the tens digits are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). \n\nIn this range, the tens digit 4 appears once, from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears once, from 481-488, but wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so actually, the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, right? Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but actually, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but 480 is included in 401-488. Wait, no, 480 is 480, which is within 401-488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, no, 480 is 480, so the tens digit is 8, and 481-488 have the tens digit 8 as well. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, no, 480 is 480, so the tens digit is 8, and 481-488 have the tens digit 8 as well. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, but 480 is 480, so the tens digit is 8, and 481-488 have the tens digit 8 as well, so that's 9 numbers. But actually, 480 is included, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, in the tens place, we have 9 instances of 8 in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. But in the last partial hundred, we have only 9 instances of 8 in the tens place. Hmm, maybe I should check that again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by considering the range 401-488. The tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each tens digit appears a certain number of times. Let me list them:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488 \u2192 8 numbers\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred. So, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times (in 441-450) and the digit 8 appears 8 times (in 481-488). \n\nSo, adding that to the complete hundreds, which gave 40 4's and 40 8's, the total in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50 4's and 40 + 8 = 48 8's. Wait, that can't be right because in the complete hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times. So, total 50 4's and 48 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because in the partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, yes, the totals would be 50 4's and 48 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear at all. So, in the hundreds place, we have 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens place: 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. So, 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute 1 4 (484) and 1 8 (488). So, total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: In each complete hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50 4's and 40 + 8 = 48 8's. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's. No 8's. So, 89 4's.\n\nAdding up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 4's.\n\nFor 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97 8's.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to calculate the total number of digits printed. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can think about each digit place separately again.\n\nWait, another thought: in the tens place, when considering 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred, not 8. Wait, that might be an error.\n\nWait, 480 is 480, which is within 401-488, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Let's count how many numbers that is. 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 8. So, in the tens place, for the last partial hundred, 8 appears 9 times, not 8. Therefore, my earlier count was wrong. It should be 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from partial hundred) = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times because 481-488 is 8 numbers, but I forgot that 480 is also included, which is part of 480-488, making it 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, correcting that, the tens place would have 40 + 9 = 49 8's, and 40 + 10 = 50 4's.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, the 4's come from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's, and the 8's come from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, adding to the complete hundreds:\n\n40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 4's.\n\n40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49 8's.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, units place: 49 each.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 91, but now I'm getting 90. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, in the tens place, 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49 8's.\n\nSo, units place: 49 8's.\n\nTens place: 49 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place: 49 4's.\n\nTens place: 50 4's.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so earlier I made a mistake in counting the number of times 8 appears in the tens place in the last partial hundred. It's 9, not 8, so total 8's are 98, leading to a difference of 90.\n\nWait, let me verify that again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 9 instances. So, in the tens place, 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49 8's.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 49 8's, so total 49 + 49 = 98 8's.\n\nWait, but in the units place, from 1-488, how many 8's are there? Let me think differently. For every 10 numbers, there's one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so one more 8 (488). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, as we've corrected, it's 49 8's.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 50.\n\nHundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 91. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again for 4's. In 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. So, in the tens place, 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50 4's. That's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 91, but after correcting the count, it's 90. So, the correct answer should be 90.\n\nWait, let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nCalculating the number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each 10 numbers, one 4. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: For each 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100, 10 4's in the tens place. 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, number of 8's:\n\n- Units place: Same as above, 49.\n\n- Tens place: In each 100 numbers, 10 8's in the tens place. 4 hundreds contribute 4 * 10 = 40. In 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each set of 10 consecutive numbers contributes one '4' and one '8'.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n   - Total: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - In 401-488, the tens digit '4' appears 10 times (441-450), and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place, contributing 89 '4's.\n   - No '8's appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. Now, how many such groups are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10 and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). In each full group, there's one 4, so that's 48 fours. Then, in the partial group, I need to check if the units digit is 4. The numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, in the tens place, the digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, in each block of 100, there are 10 fours in the tens place. Now, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks of 100 and a partial block of 88 numbers (400-488). In each full block, that's 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Now, in the partial block (400-488), the tens digit cycles again. Let's see: from 400-409, the tens digit is 0, so no fours. 410-419, tens digit 1, no fours. 420-429, tens digit 2, no fours. 430-439, tens digit 3, no fours. 440-449, tens digit 4, so that's 10 fours. 450-459, tens digit 5, no fours. 460-469, tens digit 6, no fours. 470-479, tens digit 7, no fours. 480-488, tens digit 8, no fours. Wait, but from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. So that's 10 fours. So, total fours in the tens place: 40 (from full blocks) +10=50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place. As before, in each group of 10, the units digit cycles 0-9, so each group has exactly one 8. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10 and a partial group of 8 numbers. So, 48 eights from the full groups. In the partial group (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, in each block of 100, there are 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-488, there are 4 full blocks of 100 and a partial block of 88. So, 4*10=40 eights from the full blocks. Now, in the partial block (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only from page 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights there. So, yes, 40 from the full blocks and 9 from the partial, totaling 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nWait, when I counted the units place for 4's, I had 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in the last group (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, 4's: in each block of 100, 10 fours, so 4 blocks give 40, plus in 440-449, another 10 fours, so total 50. That seems right.\n\nFor hundreds place, 4's: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 full groups, each with one 8, so 48, plus in the last group, 488 has an 8, so 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: each block of 100 has 10 eights, so 4 blocks give 40. Then, in the partial block 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all cases correctly. For example, in the hundreds place, 488 is included, so from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. Yes, 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 8's, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. That's correct.\n\nAnother check: let's count the total number of digits printed. Each page from 1-9 has one digit, 10-99 has two digits, 100-488 has three digits. So, total digits: 9*1 + 90*2 + (488-99)*3 = 9 + 180 + 389*3. Wait, 488-99=389. 389*3=1167. So, total digits: 9+180=189 +1167=1356 digits. Now, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188-98=90. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. For each digit place, calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: floor(488/10) =48, plus if the last partial group has a 4, which it does (484), so 49.\n- 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last partial group has an 8, which it does (488), so 49.\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. Total 50.\n- 8's: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. Total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n- 8's: none, since 488 <800.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll do this for both 4 and 8 to make it systematic. \n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with complete sets, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does the last set go beyond 480? Let me check: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, so the units digit 4 appears once more at 484. So, total units place 4's would be 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (from 484), totaling 49. Wait, but wait, let me think again. Each full decade (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has one 4 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many full decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the 489th decade (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, we check if 484 is within that range. 484 is indeed in 481-488, so that's an additional 4, making it 49. So, units place: 49 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10, and so on. Let's see how many full hundreds are there in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the 401-500 range, but our book only goes up to 488, so we need to check how many fours are in the tens place from 401-488. The tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. Wait, but 440 is in 401-488, so yes, that's 10 more. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but wait, 400-499 is the next hundred, but since we're only going up to 488, does that affect it? Let me confirm: from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. So, hundreds place: 89 fours.\n\nAdding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me recount. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct, 89 fours.\n\nNow, units place: 49 fours, tens place: 50 fours, hundreds place: 89 fours. Total fours: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours printed: 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to the fours, in each set of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many full decades? 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 8 appears at 488, which is one more. So total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such range contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes one such range, so 4*10=40 eights. Now, in the 401-500 range, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489. But our book goes only up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So that's 9 more eights. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that's 98 eights. So, total eights printed: 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nLet me recount the fours:\n\nUnits place: For every 10 numbers, one 4. From 1-488, how many tens? 48 full tens (1-480) and then 481-488. So, 48*1 = 48 fours in units place from 1-480, and in 481-488, 484 has a 4 in units, so 1 more, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: For every 100 numbers, 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40 +10=50 fours in tens place. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place, so 89. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49 +50 +89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, eights:\n\nUnits place: Same as fours, 49 eights. Correct.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, each hundred has 10 eights in tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 more. So total tens eights: 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: None, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So 0. Correct.\n\nTotal eights: 49 +49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that in the hundreds place, the 4's count includes 400-488, which is correct, but when counting eights, the tens place in 401-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to check: Maybe using a formula or different approach. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in units place from 1 to n is floor((n + 1)/10) + extra if the digit is less than the units digit of n+1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nIf n >= d, then floor(n/10) + 1 if the units digit of n is >= d, else floor(n/10).\n\nWait, maybe I should use this approach to confirm.\n\nFor digit 4 in units place:\n\nn=488.\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place: floor(488/10) = 48. Now, check if 488's units digit (8) >=4, which it is, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in units place:\n\nfloor(488/10)=48. Check if 8 <=8, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in tens place from 1 to n is floor((n)/100)*10 + extra.\n\nIf the tens digit of n is >d, add 10. If it's equal, add (n%100 +1). If it's less, add 0.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, the formula is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10\n\nremainder = n % 100\n\nif remainder >= 10*d:\n    count += 10\nelif remainder >= d*10:\n    count += remainder - 10*d + 1\nelse:\n    count += 0\n\nWait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, for digit d in tens place, the count is:\n\nfull hundreds = n // 100\ncount = full hundreds * 10\n\nremaining = n % 100\nif remaining >= 10*d:\n    count +=10\nelif remaining >= d*10:\n    count += remaining - 10*d +1\nelse:\n    count +=0\n\nWait, let's try this for digit 4 in tens place, n=488.\n\nfull hundreds = 488 // 100 =4\ncount=4*10=40\n\nremaining=488%100=88\n\nSince 88 >=10*4=40, so count +=10, making total 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in tens place, n=488.\n\nfull hundreds=4\ncount=4*10=40\n\nremaining=88\n\nNow, 88 >=10*8=80, so count +=10, but wait, 88 is less than 80+10=90, so we add 88 -80 +1=9.\n\nWait, no, the formula says if remaining >=10*d, add 10, else if remaining >=d*10, add (remaining -10*d +1). Wait, but 10*d for d=8 is 80. So, 88 >=80, so we add 88 -80 +1=9. So, total count=40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in hundreds place from 1 to n is:\n\nif d=0: special case, since 0 can't be a leading digit.\n\nelse:\n\ncount = (n // 1000) * 100\n\nremaining = n % 1000\n\nif remaining >=100*d:\n    count +=100\nelif remaining >=d*100:\n    count += remaining - 100*d +1\nelse:\n    count +=0\n\nBut in our case, n=488, which is less than 1000, so:\n\nfor d=4:\n\ncount=0*100=0\n\nremaining=488\n\nsince 488 >=400, so count +=488 -400 +1=89.\n\nSo, 89 fours in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nFor d=8:\n\ncount=0*100=0\n\nremaining=488\n\nsince 488 <800, so no addition. So, 0 eights in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, I get the same counts as before.\n\nThus, total fours:188, total eights:98, difference:90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours was 89, which is correct, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, let me think about the page numbers:\n\nFrom 1-99: single and double digits.\n\nFrom 100-488: three-digit numbers.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, only numbers 400-488 have 4 in hundreds place, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nFor the tens place, as calculated, 50 fours.\n\nUnits place:49 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, units and tens as calculated.\n\nI think the calculations are correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.\n   - Total full decades: 48 (1-480), contributing 48 fours.\n   - In 481-488, 484 has a 4, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 fours (e.g., 40-49).\n   - Total full hundreds: 4 (1-400), contributing 4\u00d710 = 40 fours.\n   - In 401-488, 440-449 contributes 10 fours.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89 fours.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.\n   - Total full decades: 48 (1-480), contributing 48 eights.\n   - In 481-488, 488 has an 8, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 eights (e.g., 80-89).\n   - Total full hundreds: 4 (1-400), contributing 4\u00d710 = 40 eights.\n   - In 401-488, 480-488 contributes 9 eights (480-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 eights.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights.\n\n**Difference:**\n- 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll take the integer part, which is 48 full blocks. Each block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial block from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, actually, it's 48 full blocks plus one more, making it 49 times in the units place. \n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a range of 10 numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, and so on. Let's see how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then each subsequent range is 100 numbers apart. So, starting from 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Now, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's five ranges in total. Each range contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place, so that's 5 * 10 = 50 times. \n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for page numbers from 400 to 488. Let's calculate how many numbers that is. 488 minus 400 plus 1 equals 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nAdding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me do that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges. \n\nFirst, 80-89: that's 10 numbers. Then, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: each is another 10 numbers. So that's four ranges in total. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, for the tens place, we have:\n\n- 80-89: 10 times\n- 180-189: 10 times\n- 280-289: 10 times\n- 380-389: 10 times\n- 480-488: 9 times (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 - 480 + 1 = 9)\n\nSo, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The last range, 480-488, contributes 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for page numbers from 800 to 899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the range 480-488, how many 8's are there in the tens place? Each number from 480 to 488 has an 8 in the tens place, right? So, 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9 times. So, the tens place for 8's is 49, and units place is 49, so total 98.\n\nNow, comparing the counts: 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check that again.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, I considered ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. That's correct because 440-449 is within 488.\n\nWait, but when I think about 440-449, that's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, yes, 50 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nFor the 8's, in the tens place, I have 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 49, correct.\n\nUnits place: 49, correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be an overcount. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For 4's: How many times does 4 appear in the units place from 1 to 488?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, floor(488/10) is 48, and since 488's units digit is 8, which is >=4, so we add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same calculation. floor(488/10) is 48, and since the last digit is 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- For 4's: The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n\nEach of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges * 10 = 50. Correct.\n\n- For 8's: The tens digit is 8 in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n\nFirst four ranges have 10 each, last has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: 400-488. That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Correct.\n\n- For 8's: 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

I'll consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra numbers. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so no additional 4's there. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: \n\n- 40-49: that's one block, contributing 10 fours.\n- 140-149: another block, another 10 fours.\n- 240-249: another block, 10 fours.\n- 340-349: another block, 10 fours.\n- 440-449: another block, 10 fours.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Now, let's count how many blocks that is. From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 blocks. So, 5 times 10 is 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours. \n\nWait, but 488 is included, so 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the fours from each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total number of 4's is 187.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Hmm, units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds: 89. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Plus, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so that includes one more 8 (488). So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are up to 488.\n\n- 80-89: 10 eights.\n- 180-189: 10 eights.\n- 280-289: 10 eights.\n- 380-389: 10 eights.\n- 480-488: Now, from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all these, contributing 9 eights.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (each contributing 10 eights) and one partial block of 9 eights. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 eights. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because 49 + 49 is 98. But wait, when I added the units and tens, I got 98, but let me check again.\n\nWait, units place: 49 eights, tens place: 49 eights, so 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated the 4's, I got 187. So, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 8's. Let me go through it again.\n\nUnits place: For every 10 numbers, one 8. From 1 to 488, how many 8's in units place?\n\nNumber of complete tens: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete tens. Each contributes one 8, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers: 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 8 is present once (488). So, total units eights: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nEach of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 blocks * 10 = 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place: As the book ends at 488, there's no 800-899 range, so 0 eights. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 4's: 187, 8's: 98. Difference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the count for 4's in the tens place. I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 fours, as each 10 numbers contribute one 4, and in the last partial set, 481-488, units digits go up to 8, so no extra 4's. So, 48 fours.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, 8's: 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. But 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 from the other blocks plus 9 gives 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the 4's count, when I counted the hundreds place, I included 440-449 as a block, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 50 fours.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the difference is 89.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 fours. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any more 4's in the units place.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (including 440-449), each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50 fours.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, adding 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. There are 48 complete groups, contributing 48 eights. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one more 8 (488), adding 1.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks contributing 40 eights, and the partial block 480-488 adds 9 eights, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up for the total counts.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. For example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. \n\nBut wait, the book goes up to 488, which is not a multiple of 10. So, I need to calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then check the remaining numbers.\n\nFirst, let's find how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does 8. So, for 48 blocks, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and similarly, 8's are also 48. \n\nNow, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488). Let's list their units digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so so far, they're equal.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, the page numbers go up to 488, so there are four hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so it's four full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. \n\nWait, no, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, in terms of hundreds, the first hundred is 1-99, the second is 100-199, third 200-299, fourth 300-399, and fifth 400-488. But since 488 is less than 500, the fifth hundred isn't complete. \n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to think of each hundred as 1-99, 100-199, etc., up to 400-499, but since we only go up to 488, the last hundred is incomplete. \n\nBut for the tens place, each full hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for each hundred, 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8. \n\nSo, how many full hundreds do we have? From 1 to 488, the hundreds are 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's five segments, but the first segment is 1-99, which is a hundred, and then each subsequent hundred is 100-199, etc., up to 400-488. So, 400-488 is the fifth segment but only 88 pages. \n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of the number of hundreds as 4 (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488 as the fifth segment, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). \n\nWait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the first four hundreds each have 100 pages, and the fifth has 89 pages. \n\nNow, for the tens place, in each full hundred, the digits 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, for the first four hundreds, each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place. \n\nNow, the fifth segment is 400-488. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nLooking at 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digits are 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), 3 (430-439), 4 (440-449), 5 (450-459), 6 (460-469), 7 (470-479), and 8 (480-488). \n\nWait, but 488 is the end, so the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). \n\nSo, in the tens place for 400-488, how many times does 4 appear? It's in the group 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. \n\nHow about 8? It's in the group 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. \n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this segment. \n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from first four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. \n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 40 (from first four hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. \n\nSo, so far, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's: 49. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears only in the pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. \n\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0. \n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. So, 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute 1 each. So, 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred (1-99, 100-199, etc.) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are four full hundreds, so 40 each. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times). So, total 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49. That looks correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I feel like 90 might be high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so yes, 89 times. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the hundreds digit is 4 only once per hundred, but no, in each hundred, the hundreds digit is fixed. So, 400-488 is one segment where the hundreds digit is 4, and it's 89 pages. So, 89 times. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, since the book doesn't go beyond 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 blocks (1-480).\n   - Each block contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8.\n   - Total from blocks: 48 each.\n   - Remaining pages 481-488: 484 (4) and 488 (8) add 1 each.\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Four complete hundreds (1-399): 40 each.\n   - Pages 400-488: \n     - 40-49 in tens place (440-449): 10 times for 4.\n     - 80-88 in tens place (480-488): 9 times for 8.\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0.\n   - Pages 100-399: hundreds digits 1, 2, 3.\n   - Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14; and so on. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of these 48 groups, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 times. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8. The digit 4 appears once here as well (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every group of 100 numbers, the digit in the tens place cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of these 4 hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, giving 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 times. So, adding that, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1). But wait, actually, each page number in 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, but let me check: 400 is included, so from 400 to 488 is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so that's correct. Units place: 48 full tens plus 1 in the last 8 pages, so 49. Tens place: 4 full hundreds (each contributing 10) plus 10 in the last partial hundred, so 50. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in each group of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 48 full groups (1-480) give 48 times. Then, in 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so page 488 is included. So, in the last group, 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For every group of 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). So, in 4 full hundreds (1-400), that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages: 480-488. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. Wait, but actually, in the tens place, it's 480-489, which is 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 pages, but 488 is the last page, so in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, the 8's are 40 (from the full hundreds) + 9 (from the last partial hundred) = 49.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the tens place, for the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, it's from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place in the last partial hundred. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, but 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. So, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. Now, how many more 4's than 8's? 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit 4 is at 484, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 more. Total 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit 8 is at 488, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 more. Total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. Since 488 is the last page, does that affect the count? Let me check: 400-488 is indeed 89 pages because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Maybe I can write a small program or use another method, but since I'm doing it manually, I think my counts are accurate. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (1-480) contribute 48, plus 1 in 481-488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40, plus 10 in 401-488, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 contributes 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 contribute 48, plus 1 in 481-488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds contribute 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up for each digit.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 consecutive numbers will have one 4 and one 8. For example, from 1-10, 4 is in 4 and 8 is in 8. Similarly, from 11-20, 14 and 18, and so on. So, I need to figure out how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages. \n\nDividing 488 by 10 gives 48 complete groups with a remainder of 8. So, in each group, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Therefore, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. But wait, the last group is only up to 488, which is 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the last partial group. Let me check if 488 includes an extra 4 or 8 in the units place. \n\nLooking at the last group, 481-488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, there's an extra 4 in 484 and an extra 8 in 488. That means for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from the complete groups) plus 1 (from the last partial group), totaling 49. Similarly, the number of 8's is 48 plus 1, totaling 49. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking how many more 4's than 8's, so maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the last group, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is within the 480-489 range, which is part of the 488 pages. So, 484 is included, adding one more 4 in the units place. Similarly, 488 adds one more 8. So, yes, both 4's and 8's in the units place have 49 each. So, the count for units place is 49 for both.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (in 1-9) to 9 (in 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so it's four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) plus the last 88 pages (401-488). \n\nSo, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the same for 8. So, that's 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 for each digit. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 times. So, in the tens place, the number of 4's is 10 (from 440-449) plus the 10 times from each of the four full hundreds, totaling 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, wait. Each full hundred contributes 10 times, so four hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), so total 4's in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place: each full hundred contributes 10 times, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and in the last partial hundred, 480-488 contributes 9 times, so total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times. So, the count for tens place is 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 89 times. \n\nWhat about the hundreds digit for 8? Well, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. There's no page where the hundreds digit is 8, because 800 would be beyond 488. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 49 + 49 is 98. So, total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98. The difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me go back to the units place. I thought that in the units place, each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8. Then, with 488 pages, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the last group is 481-488, which has units digits from 1 to 8. So, in that last group, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4's and 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. There are four full hundreds, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 times, and 8's don't appear at all, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering each digit position separately and using a formula.\n\nFor the units place, as we did, it's every 10 numbers, so total groups = 488 // 10 = 48, remainder 8. So, units digit 4's: 48 + (1 if 4 <= remainder else 0). Wait, no, actually, in the units place, each group of 10 contributes one 4, and if the remainder is >=4, we add one more. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 groups, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus if the remainder is >=4, which it is (8 >=4), so add 1, total 49. Similarly for 8's: 48 groups, plus if remainder >=8, which it is, so add 1, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each group of 100 contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. So, 488 // 100 = 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40 each. Then, the remainder is 88, so in the tens place, how many 4's and 8's? For 4's, it's the number of times 40-49 appears in the last 88 numbers. 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8's, it's 80-88, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 +9=49 for 8's.\n\nFor hundreds place, as before, 4's appear 89 times, 8's 0.\n\nSo, same result: 4's total 188, 8's 98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers. For example, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Correct.\n\nIn the units place, from 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once, 8 appears once. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up, yes, 188 4's and 98 8's, difference of 90.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if my method works. Suppose a book with 20 pages. How many more 4's than 8's?\n\nPage numbers 1-20.\n\nCounting 4's: in units place, 4 and 14: 2 times. In tens place, 40-49, but since we only go up to 20, no 4's in tens place. So total 4's: 2.\n\n8's: in units place, 8 and 18: 2 times. Tens place: none. So, difference is 0.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits place: 20//10=2 groups, so 2 4's and 2 8's. Remainder 0, so no extra. So, units: 2 each.\n\nTens place: 20//100=0 full hundreds, so 0 each. Remainder 20, so in tens place, 4's: 40-49 not present, so 0. 8's: 80-89 not present, so 0.\n\nHundreds place: 4's: 400-488 not present, so 0. 8's: same, 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 2, 8's: 2. Difference 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 50 pages.\n\n4's: units place: 4,14,24,34,44: 5 times. Tens place: 40-49: 10 times. So total 4's: 5+10=15.\n\n8's: units place: 8,18,28,38,48: 5 times. Tens place: 40-49: no 8's. 50: no. So, 8's: 5.\n\nDifference: 15-5=10.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits place: 50//10=5 groups, each with one 4 and one 8. Remainder 0, so units: 5 each.\n\nTens place: 50//100=0 full hundreds. Remainder 50, so in tens place, 4's: 40-49: 10 times. 8's: 80-89 not present, so 0.\n\nHundreds place: 4's: 0, 8's:0.\n\nTotal 4's: 5 (units) +10 (tens) =15. 8's:5 (units) +0=5. Difference 10. Correct.\n\nSo, my method seems to work. Therefore, in the original problem, the difference is 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The last partial group (481-488) adds one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n   - Total 8's in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each group of 100 numbers contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete groups of 100, contributing 40 each.\n   - In the last partial group (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: \\(40 + 10 = 50\\)\n   - Total 8's in tens place: \\(40 + 9 = 49\\)\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - The hundreds digit 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nSummarizing the counts:\n- Total 4's: \\(49\\) (units) + \\(50\\) (tens) + \\(89\\) (hundreds) = \\(188\\)\n- Total 8's: \\(49\\) (units) + \\(49\\) (tens) + \\(0\\) (hundreds) = \\(98\\)\n\nThe difference between the number of 4's and 8's is:\n\\[ 188 - 98 = 90 \\]\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\(\\boxed{90}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the range 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers. Dividing that by 10 gives me 48 sets of 10, so 48 times the digit 4 appears in the units place. But wait, from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, but 488 is the last page. So, from 481 to 488, the units digit cycles through 1 to 8. So, in that last partial set, there's a 4 in the units place on page 484. So, that adds one more 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each set of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that would be 4 * 10 = 40 times. But wait, let me check: the first hundred (1-100) has 40-49, which is 10 numbers. The second hundred (101-200) has 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349 each contribute 10. That's 4 sets, so 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is beyond 449, so 440-449 is fully within 401-488. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's would be 4*10 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, because 4 hundreds would be 400, but I think I'm double-counting. Let me think again. From 1-400, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's 10 times per hundred, so 4 hundreds would have 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers, so 89 times. \n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place. Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles. So, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once more on page 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see, from 1-400, how many sets of 100 are there? 4 sets. Each set contributes 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place in 401-488. The tens digit 8 is in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times, correct. So, 40 from 1-400, plus 9 from 401-488, totaling 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49, tens 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify. Maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers has one 4 in units. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is in there, adding one more. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. From 1-400, that's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is another 10. So, 40 +10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, 49 +50 +89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 8 is on page 488, so one more. Total 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. From 1-400, that's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, yes, 188 -98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I should check with an alternative method or a formula to ensure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, the count can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor a given digit d and position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times d appears can be calculated by:\n\n- For units place: floor(n/10) + (1 if the remainder is >= d else 0), but adjusted for when d=0.\n\nWait, but since we're dealing with digits 4 and 8, which are non-zero, maybe a formula applies.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nIn general, for a number with m digits, the count of digit d in the k-th position (from right, starting at 0) can be calculated as:\n\nhigher = number formed by digits to the left of k-th position\ncurrent = digit at k-th position\nlower = number formed by digits to the right of k-th position\ncount = higher * 10^k\nif current > d: count += 10^k\nif current == d: count += lower + 1\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated, but perhaps it can help verify.\n\nLet me try applying this formula for the units place (k=0) for digit 4.\n\nn=488.\n\nFor units place (k=0):\n\nhigher = 488 // 10 = 48\ncurrent = 488 % 10 = 8\nlower = 0\n\ncount = higher * 1 + (if current >4: add 1 else 0) + (if current ==4: add lower +1)\n\nWait, no, the formula is:\n\ncount = higher * 10^k\nif current > d: count += 10^k\nif current == d: count += lower +1\n\nSo, for d=4, k=0:\n\nhigher = 488 //10 = 48\ncurrent = 8\nlower = 0\n\ncount = 48 *1 =48\nsince current (8) >4, add 1: 48 +1=49\nsince current !=4, no further addition.\n\nSo, units place 4's:49, which matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place (k=1), d=4:\n\nhigher =488 //100=4\ncurrent= (488 //10) %10=8\nlower=8\n\ncount= higher *10=4*10=40\nsince current (8) >4, add 10: 40 +10=50\nsince current !=4, no further addition.\n\nSo, tens place 4's:50, which matches.\n\nFor hundreds place (k=2), d=4:\n\nhigher=488//1000=0\ncurrent= (488//100)%10=4\nlower=88\n\ncount= higher *100=0\nsince current=4, add lower +1=88 +1=89\nso, total hundreds place 4's:89, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place (k=0), d=8:\n\nhigher=488//10=48\ncurrent=8\nlower=0\n\ncount=48*1=48\nsince current=8, which is equal to d=8, add lower +1=0 +1=1\nso, total units place 8's=48 +1=49, which matches.\n\nTens place (k=1), d=8:\n\nhigher=488//100=4\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8\nlower=8\n\ncount=4*10=40\nsince current=8, add lower +1=8 +1=9\nso, total tens place 8's=40 +9=49, which matches.\n\nHundreds place (k=2), d=8:\n\nhigher=488//1000=0\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4\nlower=88\n\ncount=0*100=0\nsince current=4 <8, no addition\nso, total hundreds place 8's=0.\n\nThus, total 8's=49+49=98, which matches.\n\nSo, using the formula, I get the same counts, so I'm confident that the counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times\n- **Tens place:** 50 times\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times\n- **Tens place:** 49 times\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, I need to find how many such groups there are in 488 pages.\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, for every group of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, I need to count how many such groups exist in 488.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, that's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Wait, let me check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nNow, let's calculate each place for 4:\n\n- Units place: The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, that's not quite right because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is actually the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra if the last partial decade includes a 4. The last number is 488, so the last group is 480-488. The units digit in this group goes up to 8, so 484 is included. Therefore, the units digit 4 appears once in each of the 48 complete groups (1-10, 11-20, ..., 471-480) and once in 481-488 (which is 484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but actually, from 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Then, from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So total is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: For the tens place, each group of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many such groups are there in 488? The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're considering the tens place, let's see:\n\nIn the range 1-99: the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 times.\n\nIn 100-199: the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, another 10.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10.\n\n300-399: 340-349, 10.\n\n400-488: Here, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, so that's 10. So, total tens place 4's: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 5 groups of 10, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but 400-488: the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, so 440-449 is indeed within 400-488, so yes, that's 10.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: As I thought earlier, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me double-check each component.\n\nUnits place: 48 groups of 10 up to 480, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, 481-488 includes 484, so that's one more, making 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has a 40-49, which is 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-4). Wait, but 0-4 in hundreds? Wait, 1-99 is considered as hundreds digit 0, right? So, yes, 0-4 in hundreds digit, but actually, in 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, 89.\n\nAdding them up: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Units place: Similar to 4's, but we need to count how many times 8 appears in the units place. So, for every group of 10, 8 appears once. From 1-488, how many such groups?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last group, 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's one more 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, same as 4's? Hmm, but let me check. From 1-480, 48 groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, 481-488 includes 488, so that's one more, making 49. So, units place 8's: 49.\n\n- Tens place: Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? For each group of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each hundred, that's 10 times.\n\nSo, from 1-99: 80-89, which is 10.\n\n100-199: 180-189, another 10.\n\n200-299: 280-289, another 10.\n\n300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n\n400-488: Here, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here, not 10.\n\nWait, so in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 instead of 10.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49.\n\nWait, let me add that up: 10 +10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, tens place 8's: 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, so 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49 (correct, as each group of 10 up to 480 gives 48, plus 484 in the last group).\n\n- Tens place: 50 (each hundred up to 400-488, which includes 440-449, so 10 each for 5 hundreds, total 50).\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488, inclusive).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 (same logic as 4's).\n\n- Tens place: 49 (10 each for first four hundreds, and 9 in the last partial hundred).\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the tens place for 8's, I might have missed something. Let me verify the tens place for 8's again.\n\nIn the range 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\n- 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers.\n\n- 100-199: 180-189, 10.\n\n- 200-299: 280-289, 10.\n\n- 300-399: 380-389, 10.\n\n- 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive).\n\nSo, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, we had 5 groups of 10, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems correct too.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The hundreds place for 4's is 89, which is correct because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. But wait, 488 - 400 +1 = 89, yes.\n\nAnd for the hundreds place for 8's, it's zero, correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I think it's easier to count the number of times each digit appears in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. Wait, actually, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once every ten numbers. But in our case, the page numbers go up to 488, so I need to see how many complete sets of ten there are and if there's a partial set at the end.\n\nLet me calculate how many complete sets of ten there are in 488 pages. Dividing 488 by 10 gives me 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and a partial set of 8 numbers (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). \n\nNow, for each complete set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for each set, both 4 and 8 contribute 1 each. Therefore, for 48 complete sets, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. \n\nBut wait, I also have a partial set from 481 to 488. Let me list those page numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Now, looking at the units digits here: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial set, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nSo, total units place 4's: 48 (from complete sets) + 1 (partial set) = 49.\nTotal units place 8's: 48 (from complete sets) + 1 (partial set) = 49.\n\nSo, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, interesting. So, units place doesn't contribute to the difference. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nBut again, since our book ends at 488, I need to consider how many complete hundreds there are and any partial hundreds.\n\n488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of 4's in the tens place in each complete hundred.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred, specifically 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, for each complete hundred, 10 times. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place 10 times per hundred, so 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, the partial hundred is from 401-488. Let's look at the tens digit here. The numbers go from 401 to 488, so the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). Wait, actually, 401-410 would have a tens digit of 0, 411-420 would be 1, and so on up to 481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which has a tens digit of 8.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the 4's in the tens place would be in the set 440-449. But wait, in the partial hundred, we start at 401, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's 10 numbers: 440-449. So, 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 in the tens place would be in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\nTotal 4's: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial hundred) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from partial hundred) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. That means the 4's have 1 more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, etc.) has the same hundreds digit for all its numbers.\n\nSo, let's see how many times each hundreds digit appears.\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no contribution to 4 or 8.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4 or 8 here.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, no 4 or 8.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, no 4 or 8.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so every page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the next hundred after 400-499 would be 500-599, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place in this book.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's have 89 more than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\nDifference: 0\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\nDifference: +1\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\nDifference: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each set of ten has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- 48 complete sets: 48*1 = 48 each.\n- Partial set 481-488: 484 has a 4, 488 has an 8. So, 484 adds 1 to 4's, 488 adds 1 to 8's.\n- Total units: 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each complete hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 complete hundreds: 4*10 = 40 each.\n- Partial hundred 401-488:\n  - 4's in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n  - 8's in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n- So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n- Difference: +1. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- From 400-488: 89 numbers with hundreds digit 4.\n- 8's in hundreds place: 0\n- So, 89 more 4's. Correct.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I count the hundreds place, I considered all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. Since 8 never appears in the hundreds place, that's 89 more 4's.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's have 50 and 8's have 49, so 1 more.\n\nUnits place: equal, so no difference.\n\nSo, total more 4's than 8's: 89 +1 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Yes, correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: 400 is page 400, 401 is 401, ..., up to 488. So, 89 pages.\n\nSo, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99 +89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the total counts again to make sure.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the places and the counts seem accurate.

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, from 1 to 488, how many groups of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll take the integer part, which is 48 full groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last group is from 481-490, but our book only goes up to 488, so the 49th group isn't complete. However, since 488 is less than 490, the units digit 4 still appears once more in 484. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, maybe I should think differently. \n\nAlternatively, the number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by taking the total number of pages, dividing by 10, and taking the floor of that. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But then, in the last partial group from 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has ten numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? \n\nLet's see: The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks in total. Each contributes ten 4's in the tens place, so that's 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does the last block go up to 449? Yes, because 440-449 is within 488. So, 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNext, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. \n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours printed.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears once every ten numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial group, 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full blocks do we have? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers instead of 10. \n\nEach full block (80-89, etc.) contributes ten 8's in the tens place. So, four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4 * 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 9 more. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's.\n\nAdding up the units, tens, and hundreds place 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. To find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor the 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSubtracting 98 from 188 gives 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems right. I think I considered all the cases correctly. Let me just check the tens place for 8's again. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has ten numbers, contributing ten 8's each, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nAnd for the 4's in the tens place, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these five blocks has ten numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full tens, plus one in 484, so 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 48 full tens, plus one in 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires comparing the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo find the number of 4's:\n- **Units place**: 48 full groups of ten (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8) contribute 48 fours, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place**: Five blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) each contribute ten fours, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place**: Numbers 400-488 contribute 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTo find the number of 8's:\n- **Units place**: 48 full groups contribute 48 eights, plus one in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place**: Four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 40 eights, plus nine in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place**: No eights appear here.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then add them up. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once in every block of 10. \n\nBut wait, the book has 488 pages, so I need to see how many complete blocks of 10 there are and if there's a partial block. Let me calculate how many tens are in 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and an additional 8 numbers. \n\nIn each complete block of 10, as I thought earlier, the digit 4 appears once and the digit 8 appears once. So, for 48 blocks, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48, and the same for 8's. \n\nNow, in the remaining 8 numbers (which are 481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nSo, total 4's in the units place: 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from partial block) = 49. \nTotal 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nHmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero. \n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digits go from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in every 100 numbers. \n\nBut let me check: For 1-99, the tens digits are 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., up to 9 (90-99). So, each tens digit from 1 to 9 appears 10 times, and 0 appears 9 times (since 1-9 don't have a tens digit, but when considering 00-99, it's 10 times, but we're starting from 1, so maybe 9 times). Wait, no, actually, in page numbers, 1-9 are single-digit, so their tens digit is 0, but I think when considering two-digit numbers, the tens digit starts at 1. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.\n\nFor the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. But since we're starting from 1, the first 9 numbers (1-9) have a tens digit of 0, and then 10-19 have a tens digit of 1, and so on up to 90-99 with a tens digit of 9. So, in 1-99, each tens digit from 1 to 9 appears 10 times, and 0 appears 9 times (from 1-9). But when considering 100-199, the tens digit cycles again, so 0 appears 10 times (100-109), then 1 appears 10 times (110-119), etc., up to 9 in 190-199. So, each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has each tens digit appearing 10 times. \n\nBut our book goes up to 488, so let's see how many hundreds we have. From 1-400, there are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Then from 401-488, which is 88 pages. \n\nWait, but actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488, which is 88 pages. \n\nSo, for each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well. \n\nSo, for four complete hundreds (1-400), the number of 4's in the tens place would be 4 * 10 = 40, and similarly, 8's would be 4 * 10 = 40. \n\nNow, let's check the partial hundred from 401-488. The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, no, 401-410 would have a tens digit of 0, 411-420 would have 1, and so on up to 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last few tens digits would be 8 (480-488). \n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears only 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, let me check: \n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n411-420: tens digit 1 (10)\n421-430: tens digit 2 (10)\n431-440: tens digit 3 (10)\n441-450: tens digit 4 (10)\n451-460: tens digit 5 (10)\n461-470: tens digit 6 (10)\n471-480: tens digit 7 (10)\n481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers, since 481 to 488 is 8 numbers)\n\nWait, so for tens digit 8 in 401-488, it appears 8 times (from 481-488). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in 441-450, and the digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488. \n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place from 401-488: 10\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 8\n\nTherefore, overall, in the tens place:\n- 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48\n\nSo, the tens place contributes 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, for the hundreds digit:\n- 1 appears 100 times (100-199)\n- 2 appears 100 times (200-299)\n- 3 appears 100 times (300-399)\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488, which is 89 numbers: 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 pages because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n\nWait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? 89 times.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 48\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 numbers, 4 appears once. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra numbers.\n\nIn 48 full tens, 48 times. In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, 8 in units place: same logic, 48 full tens (48 times) and in 481-488, 488 has an 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8. But wait, no, in the tens place, each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit from 0-9. So, 4 appears 10 times per hundred, and 8 appears 10 times per hundred.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. For 4, it's in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8, it's in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 8's: 40 + 8 = 48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 89 and 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the counts another way. For example, how many 4's are there in total?\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit place separately.\n\nWait, another approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, 4's: 49, 8's: 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's: 50, 8's: 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the range of page numbers:** 1 to 488.\n\n2. **Count occurrences of each digit in each place (units, tens, hundreds).**\n\n3. **Units Place:**\n   - For every 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n   - Number of complete blocks of 10 in 488: 48.\n   - Remaining numbers: 8 (481-488).\n   - 4 appears once in the remaining (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n4. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contains 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 hundreds.\n   - 4's: 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - 8's: 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488):\n     - 4's: 10 (441-450).\n     - 8's: 8 (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n5. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's: 89 (400-488).\n   - 8's: 0 (no pages in 800-899).\n\n6. **Sum the counts:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\n7. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

But I need to see how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. \n\nWait, but maybe it's better to calculate for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens in 488. Let me calculate that. \n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete tens. But wait, each complete ten contributes one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488, so the units digit cycles up to 8 in the last partial ten. So, actually, 488 is 48 full tens (1-480) and then 8 more pages (481-488). So, in the units place, from 1 to 480, there are 48 times where the units digit is 4. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Alternatively, the number of 4's in the units place is the floor of (488 + 1)/10, which is 48.8, so floor is 48, but then we have an extra 4 in 484, so total 49. Hmm, maybe that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units digit? Again, every 10 numbers, so 48 times, but also check if 488 is included. 488 ends with 8, so that's an additional 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. So, the difference so far is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit. The tens digit is 4 in numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Let me count how many such blocks there are.\n\nFrom 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place.\nFrom 140-149: another 10.\nFrom 240-249: another 10.\nFrom 340-349: another 10.\nFrom 440-449: another 10.\nSo that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, total 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, how about 8 in the tens place? Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's see:\n\nFrom 80-89: 10 times.\nFrom 180-189: 10 times.\nFrom 280-289: 10 times.\nFrom 380-389: 10 times.\nFrom 480-488: 9 times, since 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, total number of 8's in the tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place:\n\n- Units place: 49 4's vs 49 8's \u2192 difference 0\n- Tens place: 50 4's vs 49 8's \u2192 difference +1\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's vs 0 8's \u2192 difference +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 5 blocks of 10 for 4's, each contributing 10, so 50. For 8's, 4 blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9, totaling 49. So, 50 vs 49, difference +1.\n\nIn the units place, both 4's and 8's appeared 49 times, so no difference.\n\nSo, total difference is 89 (hundreds) + 1 (tens) + 0 (units) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4. Then, in the 49th partial ten (481-490), but our book ends at 488, so in 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is the only number in that partial ten where the units digit is 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Similarly, 8's in the units place: same logic, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then in 481-488, 488 ends with 8, so 48 + 1 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 50 times. For 8's: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8's in hundreds place: none, since 800 is beyond 488. So, 0.\n\nSo, adding up: 89 (hundreds) +1 (tens) +0 (units) =90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all digit places correctly. Sometimes, when numbers have leading zeros, but in page numbers, leading zeros aren't printed, so 1 is just '1', not '001'. So, I think my approach is correct because I'm considering each digit place as they appear in the actual numbers without leading zeros.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is to calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nLet me try that method to cross-verify.\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that matches. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount any numbers. For example, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds digit. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each block of 100 contributes 10 4's in the tens digit, and we have 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: same as before, 49 each.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\n188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've considered all cases. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full tens and one partial ten (481-488) where 4 appears at 484. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, with an extra at 488. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, so 5\u00d710=50.\n   - **8's:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (9 numbers). Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **8's:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each position one by one, starting with the units place.\n\n**Units Place:**\nFor the units digit, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit (like 4 or 8) appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and considering any remainder.\n\nTotal pages: 488\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 with a remainder of 8.\n\nSo, for each digit, the number of times it appears in the units place is 48 times for each complete group of 10, plus any additional times it appears in the remaining 8 numbers.\n\nFor digit 4:\nIn the units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, 48 times for the complete groups, plus in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once more (page 484). Therefore, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nFor digit 8:\nSimilarly, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 times for the complete groups. In the remaining 8 numbers, the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). Therefore, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. Hmm, that's interesting. So, no difference there.\n\n**Tens Place:**\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 numbers and stays the same for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 10 to 19, the tens digit is 1; from 20 to 29, it's 2, and so on.\n\nTo find how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place, I can think of how many complete sets of 100 there are in 488 pages, and then handle the remaining pages.\n\nTotal pages: 488\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (since 400 is the start of the 4th hundred, and 488 is within the 4th hundred).\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, in 100-199, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 4 hundreds (1-400), each digit appears 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times in the tens place. But wait, 488 is beyond 400, so I need to adjust for the remaining 88 pages (401-488).\n\nWait, actually, let me correct that. The first 400 pages consist of 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, each digit appears 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the remaining pages from 401 to 488, which is 88 pages. The tens digit in this range is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 pages.\n\nSo, for the tens place in the remaining 88 pages:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 10 pages (401-410)\n- Tens digit 1: 10 pages (411-420)\n- ...\n- Tens digit 8: 8 pages (481-488)\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place, in the first 400 pages, it's 40 times. In the remaining 88 pages, does the tens digit ever reach 4? Let's see: from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420 is 1; 421-430 is 2; 431-440 is 3; 441-450 is 4. Wait, 441-450 is 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So, from 441-450, that's 10 pages. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is the total, so from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from first 400) + 10 = 50.\n\nFor digit 8 in the tens place: In the first 400 pages, it's 40 times. In the remaining 88 pages, from 481-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 8 pages. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. So, 4 has 2 more occurrences than 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For the first 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, in 401-488, for tens digit 4, it's 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 more 4's. For 8, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 more 8's. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's. Yes, that seems correct.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\nNow, the hundreds place. This is where the page numbers go from 1-9 (single-digit), then 10-99 (two-digit), and then 100-488 (three-digit). So, the hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers. Let's figure out how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99, there are no hundreds digits. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSo, for the hundreds digit:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, 100 times.\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, 100 times.\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, 100 times.\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, 89 times (since 400-488 is 89 pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the hundreds place: it appears 89 times (from 400-488).\n\nFor digit 8 in the hundreds place: does 800-899 exist? No, because the book only has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, 4 has 89 more occurrences than 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with hundreds digit 4. So, yes, 89 times. And since the book doesn't go beyond 488, there are no pages with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 times.\n\n**Now, let's sum up the occurrences for each digit:**\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 with remainder 8.\n- So, 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1 =49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n- First 400 pages: each digit appears 40 times in the tens place.\n- From 401-488, which is 88 pages:\n  - Tens digit 4: from 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 more 4's.\n  - Tens digit 8: from 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 more 8's.\n- So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50.\n- Total 8's in tens place:40 +8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages with hundreds digit 4.\n- No pages with hundreds digit 8.\n- So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n- 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97.\n- Difference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 with a remainder of 8).\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - For the first 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - Tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each place value separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers will have exactly one 4 in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, in the 480th group, which is 480-489, we have 484, which is within 488, so that's another 4. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from 1 to 480) plus 1 more (484), making it 49. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as floor(N/10) + 1 if the units digit is 4 or higher, but maybe a better way is to consider that for every 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? It's the number of times 4 appears in the units digit, which is every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial decade, which is 480-488, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, so that's one more 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, in the tens place, 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle, 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, so that's one more 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4, from x40 to x49, where x is the hundreds digit. So, for each hundred, that's 10 numbers. So, from 0-99, 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199, 140-149: 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's.\n\nAdding them up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with units place. Similar to 4's, but let's see. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial decade, 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nTens place: Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but only up to 488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: since it's only up to 488, how many numbers are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, in the tens place, each of these 5 blocks contributes 10 8's except the last one, which contributes 9? Wait, no, because in the tens place, it's about the tens digit being 8, regardless of the units digit. So, from 480-489, the tens digit is 8 for all 10 numbers (480-489). But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is still 8 for all of them. So, in the tens place, each block contributes 10 8's except the last one, which contributes 9? Wait, no, that's not correct. The tens digit is 8 regardless of the units digit. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, that's 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus the last block 480-488, which is 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place, so 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for exactly 10 numbers: x80 to x89, where x is the hundreds digit. So, from 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389:10. 400-488: 480-488: but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, in the tens place, 4 blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, so total 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 8's in the tens place there.\n\nNow, hundreds place. When does the hundreds digit equal 8? That would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49, same as 4's. But when I added up, 4's were 188, 8's were 98, so the difference would be 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 8's.\n\nWait, in the tens place, I thought 480-488 contributes 9 8's in the tens place, but actually, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these counts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears in each position is to consider each digit place separately.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if the remainder is >=4. 488 mod 10=8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if remainder >=8. 488 mod10=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4 (since 488/100=4.88), then for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so 4 times 10 (for 40-49 in each hundred), plus the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, maybe a better formula is:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in the tens place up to N:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10\n\nremainder = N % 100\n\nif remainder >= 10*d + 10, then add 10\nelse if remainder >= 10*d, then add (remainder - 10*d +1)\nelse add 0\n\nWait, let's apply this for 4 in the tens place up to 488.\n\nN=488\n\ncount = (488 // 100) *10 =4*10=40\n\nremainder=488%100=88\n\nSince d=4, 10*d=40.\n\nIs remainder >=40+10=50? 88>=50, yes, so add 10.\n\nTotal 40+10=50. That matches our earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place:\n\nd=8, 10*d=80.\n\ncount=(488//100)*10=4*10=40\n\nremainder=88\n\nIs 88>=80+10=90? No, so check if remainder>=80. 88>=80, yes, so add (88-80+1)=9.\n\nSo, total 40+9=49. That matches our earlier count.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in the hundreds place up to N:\n\ncount = (N // 1000) * 100\n\nremainder = N % 1000\n\nif remainder >= 100*d, then add 100, else add 0.\n\nWait, but for d=4, N=488.\n\ncount=(488//1000)*100=0*100=0\n\nremainder=488\n\nsince 488 >=100*4=400, add 488-400+1=89.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. So, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89, which matches our earlier count.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place:\n\nd=8, 100*d=800.\n\nSince N=488 <800, so count=0.\n\nSo, total 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nThus, total 4's:49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188\n\nTotal 8's:49(units)+49(tens)+0(hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. For example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place every 10 numbers. \n\nFirst, let's find how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages (481-488). \n\nIn each complete block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and similarly, the number of 8's is 48. \n\nNow, for the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once (page 484), and the digit 8 appears once (page 488). \n\nSo, total units place: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's = 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal. \n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 numbers.\n\nNow, let's see how many complete hundreds are in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and similarly, 8's is 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each 10 pages. Let's break it down:\n\n- Pages 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- Pages 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- Pages 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- Pages 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- Pages 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- Pages 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- Pages 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- Pages 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- Pages 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in pages 441-450, which is 10 times. The digit 8 appears in pages 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 times (from 481-488). Wait, but 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nSo, total tens place: 4's = 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50, and 8's = 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 fours and 48 eights. So, fours have 2 more here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100-488. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nLet's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (not printed, since it's a 1 or 2-digit number)\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from pages 400-488. Let's count how many pages that is: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest page is 488, so hundreds digit goes up to 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place: 4's = 89, and 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the units place. When I calculated the units place, I considered 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 4's = 48 +1=49, 8's=48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10=40 for both. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (441-450), and 8 appears for 8 pages (481-488). So, 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, 8's:40+8=48. So, that's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8's don't appear in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188. Total 8's:49 +48 +0=97. Difference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking that maybe I overcounted the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me check: pages 400-488. How many pages is that? 488 -400 +1=89 pages. So, yes, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom 401-488, which is 88 pages. The tens digits go from 0 to 8, but in the last partial block, 481-488, which is 8 pages, the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, and 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me try another approach to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each 10 pages, one 4. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, contributing 48 4's, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), the 4 appears once (484). So, 48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: For each 100 pages, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100, 10 4's in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (441-450). So, 40+10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: Same as above, 48 full tens contributing 48 8's, plus in the last 8 pages, 488 has an 8, so 48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: In each 100, 10 8's in the tens place. 4 full hundreds:4*10=40. In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages (481-488). So, 40+8=48.\n\n- Hundreds place: No 8's, as before.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is a significant number. Let me just confirm that.\n\nFrom page 400 to 488, that's 488 -400 +1=89 pages. Each of these pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, the 4's in the tens place are 50, which includes the 40 from the full hundreds and 10 from the partial block. Similarly, 8's in the tens place are 48, which includes 40 from the full hundreds and 8 from the partial block.\n\nUnits place is 49 for both, so that's equal.\n\nSo, 188 4's and 97 8's, difference is 91.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Complete blocks of 10: 48, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488): 1 more 4 (484) and 1 more 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 4's: 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8's: 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total: 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's: 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8's: 0 times (no page numbers start with 8).\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

For each place, I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's and then sum them up. \n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 consecutive numbers will have one 4 and one 8. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. \n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then multiplying by 1, since each set of 10 has one 4 and one 8. But I need to be careful if the total number isn't a multiple of 10. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, the integer part is 48, meaning there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. However, the remaining 8 numbers (from 481 to 488) also have a units digit. Let me check if there are any 4's or 8's in these remaining units digits. \n\nFrom 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, there's an extra 4 and an extra 8. So, in total, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, they are equal here. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so when I divided by 10, I should consider that the last set might not be complete. Let me think again. The number of complete sets of 10 in 488 pages is 48 full sets (1-480), and then 481-488 is the 49th partial set. In each full set, the units digit cycles from 0-9, so in each set, there's exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 sets contribute 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, in the partial set (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, we have one more 4 and one more 8. Therefore, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So, they are equal here.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for the tens place, the number of 4's and 8's can be calculated by considering how many hundreds are in 488 pages. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then the remaining 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 full hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and the same for 8's: 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digits here range from 0-8 (since 488 is 488, the tens digit goes up to 8). So, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-488). Each of these tens digits appears 10 times except possibly the last one if the number of pages isn't a multiple of 10. Wait, from 401-488, that's 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (401-410 is 10 pages, 411-420 is another 10, etc., up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last tens digit is 8, which only has 8 pages (481-488). \n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 pages (440-449). But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 pages, so 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\n- The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify. The tens digit in 401-488 is as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 pages)\n\nSo, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place for 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times, and the digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 from 401-488, totaling 50.\n- 8's: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 8 from 401-488, totaling 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers, which are from 100-488. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nFor the hundreds place, each digit from 1-3 appears 100 times each (for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and the digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- The digit 4 appears 89 times.\n- The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place because the hundreds digit only goes up to 4 (since the book ends at 488). So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so one 4 and one 8. So, total units 4's: 48 +1=49, same for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For the first 400 pages (4 full hundreds), each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +8=48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's appear 89 times (400-488), and 8's don't appear at all. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0=97.\n\n188 -97=91. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nAnother way to calculate the hundreds place is to note that the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nFor the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). Wait, earlier I thought it was 8, but actually, it's 9 pages because 488 -480 +1=9. Wait, that's a mistake I made earlier.\n\nWait, let me correct that. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 8's appear 9 times in 401-488, not 8.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 8, but actually, it's 9. Let me go back.\n\nIn the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 pages? Wait, 481-488 is 8 pages: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 8 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 9.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go as follows:\n\n- 401-410: 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420:1 (10)\n- 421-430:2 (10)\n- 431-440:3 (10)\n- 441-450:4 (10)\n- 451-460:5 (10)\n- 461-470:6 (10)\n- 471-480:7 (10)\n- 481-488:8 (8 pages)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times, not 9. So, in the tens place, 4's:10, 8's:8.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50, 8's:40+8=48.\n\nSo, my initial calculation was correct, 48 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 480-488 is 9 pages, but that's incorrect because 480 is included in the previous set (471-480: tens digit 7), so 480 is part of 480-489, but in our case, we're only going up to 488. So, the tens digit 8 starts at 480, but 480 is part of the 471-480 set, which has tens digit 7. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, 480 is part of the 480-489 range, but in our case, we're only going up to 488. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I broke it down, I had 481-488 as the last set, which is 8 pages, but that's incorrect because 480 is included in the previous set. Wait, no, 480 is part of the 480-489 range, which would have tens digit 8, but in our case, we're only going up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list the page numbers and see:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-490: tens digit 8\n\nBut since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. Therefore, in the tens place for 401-488, the digit 8 appears 8 times, not 9.\n\nWait, but 480 is part of the previous set, 471-480, which has tens digit 7, so 480 is included in that set, meaning that 480 is part of the 471-480 range, so the tens digit is 7, not 8. Therefore, the first page with tens digit 8 is 481, and the last is 488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nSo, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in 401-488, making the total 8's in the tens place 40 (from full hundreds) +8=48.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation was correct, and the 8's in the tens place are 48.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:97, difference:91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place, correct.\n\nAnother way to check: total number of digits. From 1-9: 9 digits. From 10-99: 90 numbers, 2 digits each, so 180 digits. From 100-488: 389 numbers (488-100+1=389), 3 digits each, so 1167 digits. Total digits:9+180+1167=1356 digits.\n\nNow, total 4's:188, total 8's:97, so total digits accounted for by 4's and 8's:188+97=285. The remaining digits are other numbers, which should be 1356-285=1071.\n\nBut I don't think that helps me directly, but it's a consistency check.\n\nAlternatively, I can check the count for 8's again.\n\nUnits place:49, tens place:48, hundreds place:0, total 97. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains exactly one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more '4' and one more '8'.\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred (e.g., 1-100) has 10 occurrences of '4' and 10 of '8' in the tens place.\n   - For the first 400 pages (4 full hundreds), this gives 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - In 401-488:\n     - '4' appears in the tens place 10 times (440-449).\n     - '8' appears in the tens place 8 times (480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 '4's and 48 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '4' from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **'4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **'8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 97 (number of '8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each position for both 4 and 8 and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there from 1 to 488?\n\nWell, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? The last number is 488, so the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, yes, 48 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1 to 480, how many 4's in the units place? That would be 48 times, right? Because 480 divided by 10 is 48. Then from 481 to 488, there's no 4 in the units place. So, total is 48.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens digit. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.\n\nSo, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 40-49, that's correct. Then each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, etc.) has a 40-49 block. So, up to 400-499, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488. So, that's 5 blocks, 10 numbers each, so 50 times.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, does 488 include an extra 8? Let's see: 488 ends with 8, so the last number is 488, which is the 48th group, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the 48th group? Wait, no, because 488 is the 48th group? Wait, 10 numbers make a group, so 488 is the 48th group, but actually, 488 is the 488th number, so the number of 8's in the units place is 48 times, because from 8, 18, 28,..., 488. So, yes, 48 times.\n\n2. Tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but we only go up to 488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one which only has 9 numbers (480-488).\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total number of times 8 appears in the tens place is 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 80-89, that's 10 numbers. Then each subsequent hundred block has another 10 numbers, so up to 380-389, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. From 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. Then 180-189: another 10, so 20. 280-289: another 10, so 30. 380-389: another 10, so 40. Then 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 more, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, comparing the counts:\n\nNumber of 4's: 187\n\nNumber of 8's: 97\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 times. That's correct because from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times.\n\nTens place: 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 4's. Wait, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 times, as every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place, up to 488, which ends with 8, so 48 times.\n\nTens place: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since we don't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. That's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in 4's, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Units place, 48. So, 187.\n\nFor 8's, units place 48, tens place 49, so 97.\n\nSo, 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which means 480 / 10 = 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle of 100 has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4 (40-49). So, from 1 to 400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0-8, so the next 40-49 would be from 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? Wait, no, 440 is less than 488, so from 401 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let me see: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, from 401-488, that's another 10. So total 4's in the tens place would be 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on, from 1-400, I had 4*10=40, and then from 401-488, I have another 10, so total 50. But wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers, so the tens digit cycles 8 times (since 88 / 10 = 8.8, so 8 full cycles). But in each cycle, the tens digit is 4 once, so that's 8 times? Wait, no, because from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, so the tens digit being 4 occurs once in each hundred, but 401-488 is only 88 numbers, which is less than a full hundred. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? Let me think: the numbers where the tens digit is 4 are 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, from 401-488, that's 10 occurrences. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's are units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Yes, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, but wait, 488 is the last number, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, actually, it's 48 times from 1-480, and then 488 adds another, so 49 times. Wait, let me think again. From 1-480, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place, so 480 / 10 = 48. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once more at 488. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle of 100 has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8 (80-89). So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). Wait, but 480 is included in 401-488, right? So, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 occurrences. Therefore, total tens place 8's are 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract 98 from 187: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times. That's because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but wait, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. So, the last one is 484, which is 484. So, how many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484, with a common difference of 10. So, number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought units place 4's were 48, but actually, it's 49. Because from 1-488, the units digit 4 appears 49 times. Hmm, so I might have messed up the count earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, I had 49, which would be correct because from 1-488, the units digit 8 appears 49 times (8,18,...,488). So, if 4's units place is 49, then maybe my initial count was wrong.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the 4's units place. The numbers where the units digit is 4 are 4,14,24,...,484. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place 4's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, when I thought it was 50, maybe that's incorrect. Let's recalculate the tens place for 4's.\n\nThe tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 is beyond 488, so we don't include that. So, how many sets of 100 do we have? From 1-400: 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the next set where tens digit is 4 is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50. So, that's correct. So, tens place 4's:50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count. So, 4's total:188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488. So, number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place 8's:49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, from 1-400, we have 4 sets: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, 0, since we don't reach 800.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. Hmm, where did I go wrong before? Let me check again.\n\nWait, when I first calculated the 4's units place, I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. So, that corrected the total 4's from 187 to 188. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make another mistake. Let's recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 4's. The last number with a units digit of 4 before 488 is 484, which is within 488. So, from 4,14,...,484, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((484-4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, up to 488, which is included, so 49.\n\nSo, the counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188-98=90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4); from 11-20, 4 appears once (page 14), and so on. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each of these 48 sets, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once on page 484. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, for every 100 numbers, the digit in the tens place cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each set of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). \n\nHow many complete sets of 100 are there in 488? That's 4 (since 4*100=400) with 88 remaining. So, in each of these 4 sets, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40. Now, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) need to be checked. In the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each? Wait, no. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure. From 1-400, the tens digit 4 appears 4*10=40 times. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, yes, 40 + 10 = 50. \n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers, so that's 89 times.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place. As before, in every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? 48 complete sets (48*10=480) with 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each set, 8 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once on page 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place. For every 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). \n\nHow many complete sets of 100 are there in 488? 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) need to be checked. In the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we stop at 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488, but the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 times. So, 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 9 = 49. \n\nNow, hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me verify that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. \n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me double-check. From 1-400, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 sets of 10, which is 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 in tens place. \n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when counting 4's, I had 188. So, 4's are 188, 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. From 1-400, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 hundreds, 10 each, 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the tens place from 401-488 is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about page 400, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's counted in the hundreds place. Similarly, page 480 has an 8 in the tens place, which is counted in the tens place.\n\nWait, another way to check: let me count the number of 4's and 8's in each place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: in each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. 481-488 includes 484, which is a 4 in units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: in each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 488 / 100 = 4 full sets, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). In these, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: same as 4's, 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial set 481-488 includes 488, which is an 8 in units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: in each 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 full sets (1-400), 4*10=40. Then, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). In these, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - In every 10 consecutive numbers, 4 appears once.  \n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.  \n   - The last partial set (481-488) includes one more 4 (page 484).  \n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - In every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.  \n   - There are 4 complete sets of 100, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) include 440-449, contributing 10 more.  \n   - Total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, contributing 89 times (488 - 400 + 1).  \n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.  \n   - 48 complete sets contribute 48, and the last partial set includes page 488.  \n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - In every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.  \n   - 4 complete sets contribute 40.  \n   - The remaining 88 numbers include 480-488, contributing 9 more.  \n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll do this for both 4 and 8 to make it systematic.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units digit. For every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of the 48 blocks, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? In this case, for every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 1 to 488, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10=40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit here is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, 2 for 420-429, 3 for 430-439, and 4 for 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is part of 401-488, so that's 10 more times. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? This is only in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for each number from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89 times. So, hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, plus 1 in 484, so 49. Tens: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), so total 50. Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 8:\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4, in every block of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, that's 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? For every block of 100 numbers, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). From 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10=40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, 2 for 420-429, 3 for 430-439, 4 for 440-449, 5 for 450-459, 6 for 460-469, 7 for 470-479, and 8 for 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of 401-488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of these, so that's 9 times. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all, so 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, so the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full tens + 1 (484) = 49\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds *10 = 40, plus 10 in 440-449 = 50\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 +89= 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full tens +1 (488)=49\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds *10=40, plus 9 in 480-488=49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - From 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 in the units place.\n     - There are 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing 1, totaling 48.\n     - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 adds one more.\n     - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - Every block of 100 numbers contributes 10 4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n     - 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 * 10 = 40.\n     - In 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, contributing 10.\n     - Total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers.\n     - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n   \n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Similar to 4, 48 full blocks contribute 48, plus 488 adds one more.\n     - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - 4 full hundreds contribute 4 * 10 = 40.\n     - In 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n     - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - The hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear as the book ends at 488.\n     - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n   \n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14; and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of ten and then 8 extra pages. In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 will have a 4 in the units place. That's one more 4, making the total for units place 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for a full block of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place, which is 10 times. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing one block of ten where the tens digit is 4. Wait, no, actually, each hundred has one such block. So, for 1-100, 40-49 is one block; 101-200, 140-149; 201-300, 240-249; 301-400, 340-349; and then 401-488, which would be 440-449. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So that's five blocks? Wait, no, because 400-488 is part of the 400s, so maybe I should check again. Let me think: from 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So yes, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, but wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, in every block of ten, the units digit is 8 once. So, from 1-488, how many full blocks of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place. That's 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more, making units place 8's total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Now, for the tens digit being 8, it occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks there are. \n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. Similarly for 180-189, etc. But 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9, so total 4*10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, units place was 49, tens place 49, so total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. So, in the tens place, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49, but let me check units place again. Units digit 8 occurs once every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times? It's 48 full tens (each contributing one 8), and then in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 98.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that 4's were 188 and 8's were 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me check again because sometimes I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens (48 4's) plus 484, which is one more, so 49.\n\nTens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens (48 8's) plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the 4's correctly in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, it's four full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo, yeah, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check if I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every block of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full blocks of 10 in 488, contributing 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - The last partial block (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every block of 100 numbers has a sequence of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 5 such blocks in 488: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400 to 488, every number has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - This is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every block of 10 contributes 1 occurrence of 8.\n   - 48 full blocks contribute 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - The last partial block (481-488) includes 488, adding 1 more.\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every block of 100 numbers has a sequence of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 full blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The last partial block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences (480-488).\n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). From 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 pages. In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial block from 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers. For example, from 40-49, each page has a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 times. Similarly, this happens every 100 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. In each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.). So, 4 times 10 is 40. But wait, we also have the last partial hundred from 400-488. In this range, the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, which is 10 pages, so that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. Therefore, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, in every block of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 pages. Each full block contributes 1, so 48. In the partial block (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, check the last partial hundred: 400-488. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but actually, from 480-489 would be 10, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, in the tens place, the last partial hundred contributes 9 8's. So total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks (1-480) with 1 each, and 484 is the 49th, so 49.\n- Tens: 400-488 includes 400-409 (10) and 480-488, but wait, no, earlier I thought it was 400-488. Wait, no, when considering the tens place, the 4's in the tens place are in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10, making it 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, earlier I thought 4 full hundreds, but 488 is less than 500, so actually, the hundreds are 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred except the last, the tens digit 4 appears once per block, but in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, which is 10 pages, and then 440-449, which is another 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10. So, actually, in the hundreds place, the 4's in the tens place are 400-409 (10), 440-449 (10), so 20 in the last hundred. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 full hundreds, but 488 is in the fifth hundred. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The hundreds are 1-99 (hundreds digit 0), 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each of the hundreds 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 10-19 (no, wait, tens digit 4 is in 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, in 100-199, it's 140-149, which is 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10. So that's 4 sets of 10, so 4*10=40. But wait, in the 400-488 hundred, 440-449 is 10, but 488 is beyond that, so that's fine. So, total 40 in tens place for 4's. But earlier, I thought 400-488 contributed 10, but actually, it's 10 as part of the 400-488 hundred. So, total 40 in tens place, plus the hundreds place 89, and units 49, totaling 40+49+89=178. Wait, but earlier I had 188. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, no, I think I confused the counts. Let me start over.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit? For every 10 numbers, once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last partial ten (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units, so 1 more. So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: How many times does 4 appear in the tens digit? For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, in 1-99: 40-49 (10). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds digit? From 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89.\n\nAdding them up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last partial ten (481-488), 488 has an 8 in units, so 1 more. So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: How many times does 8 appear in the tens digit? For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, in 1-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I might have made a mistake, but after recalculating, it seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). From 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, I can divide 488 by 10 to get 48 full blocks of 10, and then there's a remaining 8 pages (481-488). In each of these 48 blocks, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 484 is within this range, which means the units digit 4 appears once more. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and 240-249, and 340-349. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, the last block is 400-488, which is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 appears from 400-409 and 440-449, right? Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409 (tens digit 0, actually, wait no). Wait, maybe I'm confusing the places. Let me think again.\n\nThe tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, for numbers 40-49, the tens digit is 4. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, in 400-488, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, total tens place 4's are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the third digit from the right. In the range 1-488, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, for every block of 10 numbers, the units digit 8 appears once. So, from 1-488, there are 48 full blocks of 10 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks), each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit 8 appears in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but the numbers go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, each block of 100 contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last block which only contributes 9. Let's see how many such blocks there are.\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), and 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's four blocks contributing 10 each and one block contributing 9. So, total tens place 8's are (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For 480-488, the tens digit is 8, right? So, numbers are 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times the digit 8 in the tens place. So, yes, that's correct. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place was 49, tens was 49, so total 98. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me confirm. Units place: 48 full decades (each contributing 1) plus 1 in the last partial decade, so 49. Tens place: 4 full centuries (each contributing 10) plus 9 in the last partial century, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's was 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's.\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades (each 10 pages) gives 48, plus the last 8 pages (481-488) have one more 4 (page 484). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears once every 100 pages, 10 times each. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10), 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last 8 pages (481-488) have one more 8 (page 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: From 0-99: 80-89 (10), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), and 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades (480 instances) + 1 in the remaining 8 pages = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 5 blocks of 10 (50 instances).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 instances (400-488).\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades + 1 in the remaining 8 pages = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 blocks of 10 + 9 in the remaining pages = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 instances.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by thinking about each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll consider each place for both 4 and 8 and count their occurrences.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digit is 4 once (page 4) and 8 once (page 8). This pattern repeats every ten numbers. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of ten and then a partial set from 481 to 488. So, in each complete set of ten, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 complete sets, that's 48 times each. Now, in the partial set from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the units digit 4 appears once (page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, in total, for the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and the digit 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times, so no difference there.\n\nNext, I'll move on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, etc., and similarly, the digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49), so that's 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89). So, for four complete hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 480-489. But wait, our range only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for the partial hundred, digit 4 appears 10 times, and digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the total for 4 is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50 times. For 8, it's 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once more than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, in 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so both 4 and 8 appear zero times here. From 100 onwards, the hundreds digit cycles through 1, 2, 3, and 4 (since we go up to 488). So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Wait, actually, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nNow, the question is asking how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each.\n- Partial set from 481-488: units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, units total: 48 + 1 = 49 for both, correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Complete hundreds (1-300): 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 each.\n- Partial hundred (401-488): tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n  - For 4: tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n  - For 8: tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n- So, total for tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the hundreds place, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that part is correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately, but I think I did it correctly. Let me try an alternative approach to confirm.\n\nAlternative approach: For each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n- For each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488). In each full set, 1 occurrence each. So, 48 each. In the extra 8 pages, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- For each 100 pages, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), same for 8 (80-89). So, in 400-488, which is 89 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, the tens digit cycles every 100, but in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. The digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times. But wait, in the earlier calculation, I considered four complete hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred, 10 and 9, so total 50 for 4 and 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Only pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n- 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Digit Places:**\n   - Page numbers range from 1 to 488, so digits appear in units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n2. **Count Digit Appearances:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - For every 10 pages, digits 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n     - 488 pages have 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 each.\n     - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n     - Total: 49 each.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - For every 100 pages, digits 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 80-89).\n     - 400-488 adds 10 times for 4 (440-449) and 9 times for 8 (480-488).\n     - Total: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4; 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n     - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n     - Total: 89 for 4; 0 for 8.\n\n3. **Sum Total Appearances:**\n   - **4:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **8:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n4. **Calculate Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:**\nThere are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, in the last group, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the 4 in the units place is at 484. So, yes, 48 times for the units place. \n\nNow, moving to the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, each hundred has one such group, so from 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 401-410, right? So, each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But let me check how many hundreds we have. From 1-400, there are four hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 401-410, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 401-488 is only 88 numbers, so 401-410 is 10 numbers, which is correct. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check each place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, in the last group, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, the 8 in the units place occurs at 488, so that's correct, 48 times.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's count how many such groups. From 1-400, we have four hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. That's four groups, each with 10, so 40. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, the hundreds place has 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 1-400, we have four groups: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 groups, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) = 97.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the counts correctly. Maybe I missed something.\n\nFor the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times. That's correct because 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place.\n\n- Tens place: 50 times. From 1-400, 4 groups (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 401-410, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times, as 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The last group is 481-488, where 488 has an 8 in the units place.\n\n- Tens place: 49 times. From 1-400, four groups: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as there are no pages beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times, correct.\n\nI think that's right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each position in the page numbers separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such groups are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each group of ten, the 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times 1 is 48. But wait, I should check the last partial group from 481-488. In this group, the units digit is 4 only in 484, so that's one more. So, total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let me figure out how many such blocks there are up to 488. \n\nFrom 1-99: There's one block, 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nFrom 100-199: Another block, 140-149, contributing another 10 4's.\n\nFrom 200-299: Another block, 240-249, another 10 4's.\n\nFrom 300-399: Another block, 340-349, another 10 4's.\n\nFrom 400-488: Now, this is where it gets a bit tricky. The block would be 440-449, which is another 10 4's in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. \n\nSo, adding these up: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. Let me count how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in each group of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of ten and then a partial group of 8 pages (481-488). So, 48 times 1 is 48. Now, in the last partial group, 481-488, the units digit is 8 in 488. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. Let me check each block.\n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, another 10 8's.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, another 10 8's.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 in all these, contributing 9 8's.\n\nSo, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 is 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 48 full groups of 10 (1-480), which is 48 4's. Then, 481-488: 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place, so 1 more. Total: 49. That seems right.\n\nTens place: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nNow for the 8's:\n\nUnits place: Same as 4's, 48 full groups, 48 8's, and 488 adds one more, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: Since 800-899 is beyond 488, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98 8's. \n\nThus, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems correct. \n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 4's, 5 blocks each with 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 49. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98 total. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 is indeed 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** In every group of ten numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups (480 numbers) and one partial group (481-488). Each full group contributes 1, so 48. The partial group adds 1 (484). Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are five such blocks contributing 10 each, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. Total: 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 48 full groups contribute 48, with an extra 1 in 488. Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** Blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., contribute 10 each for four blocks and 9 in 480-488. Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles through 0-9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4). From 11-20, it appears once at page 14, and so on. \n\nNow, how many such sets of 10 are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and an extra 8 pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times. But wait, I need to check the extra pages from 481 to 488. In these, the units digit is 1-8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. \n\nHow many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see, the first block is 40-49, which is 10 pages. Then 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each set of 10, the digit 8 appears once. So, up to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. That's 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488). \n\nSo, each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many full blocks are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, the last partial block from 480-488 contributes 9 8's in the tens place (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nSo, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. Similarly for 180-189, etc. So, 4 blocks, each with 10, so 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's are 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify this because sometimes when counting digits, especially in different places, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1-488, there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in each full decade, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: Same logic, 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit 8 appears at 488, so one more. Total: 49.\n\nTens place: 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 9. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, I might have missed something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, 5 blocks of 10, so 50.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49.\n\nYes, that adds up to 188.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the tens place, I might have included numbers beyond the actual range. Let me check the tens place for 8's again.\n\nFrom 80-89: 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, and so on up to 380-389. That's four blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 480-488: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll do this by examining each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and a partial group of 8. In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.). So, that's 48 times. Then, in the partial group of 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 101-200, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, another 10 numbers, and so on. How many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 400 is the last complete hundred before 488. So, from 1-400, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these has 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, adding that, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, hold on. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 in total for the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding up the 4's from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check each place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Again, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, similar to the 4's, in each group of 10, the digit 8 appears once. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8. Each complete group gives 1 eight, so 48. Then, in the partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 has 10 such numbers. From 1-400, there are 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that's 98 8's. But let me double-check. From 1-488, in the tens place, we have 40 from 1-400 and 9 from 401-488, so 49. Units place: 48 complete groups (each contributing 1) and 1 more in the last partial group, so 49. So, 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, did I count correctly? Let me go through each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 complete groups (each 10 pages) gives 48, plus 1 in 481-488, total 49.\n\n- Tens: 4 complete hundreds (1-400) gives 4*10=40, plus 10 in 401-488 (440-449), total 50.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 complete groups, 48, plus 1 in 481-488 (488), total 49.\n\n- Tens: 4 complete hundreds, 4*10=40, plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 more. So, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 1-400, each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, 40+10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 484, which is in 481-488, so 1 more, total 49.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 48 groups, each contributing 1, plus 488, so 1 more, total 49.\n\nSo, 188 4's and 98 8's. The difference is indeed 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the hundreds place, for 4's, I counted 89 because from 400-488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Let me verify: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Correct.\n\nAnd for 8's in the hundreds place, since 800 is beyond 488, so 0. Correct.\n\nAnother way to check: maybe list out the counts for a smaller range and see if the method works. Let's say, for a 20-page book. How many 4's and 8's?\n\nPage numbers 1-20.\n\nCount of 4's: units place: 4,14 => 2. Tens place: 40-49, but since we only go up to 20, none. Hundreds place: none. So, total 2.\n\nCount of 8's: units place: 8,18 => 2. Tens place: none. Hundreds place: none. So, total 2. Difference: 0.\n\nWait, but according to my method, for 20 pages:\n\nUnits place 4's: 20/10=2, so 2.\n\nTens place: 20 is less than 100, so 0.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 2.\n\nUnits place 8's: 20/10=2, so 2.\n\nTens: 0.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 2.\n\nDifference: 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test: 50 pages.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits: 5 (4,14,24,34,44). Wait, 50/10=5, but 44 is within 50, so 5.\n\nTens: 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 5+10=15.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits: 5 (8,18,28,38,48).\n\nTens: 40-49 has 48-49? Wait, no, tens digit 8 is 80-89, which is beyond 50, so 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 5.\n\nDifference: 15-5=10.\n\nWait, but according to my method:\n\nUnits 4's: 50/10=5, correct.\n\nTens 4's: 10 (40-49), correct.\n\nUnits 8's: 50/10=5, correct.\n\nTens 8's: 0, since 80-89 is beyond 50.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 15, 8's:5, difference 10. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for smaller numbers, so it's likely correct for 488.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes 1 '4' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups (480 numbers) and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400, there are 4 blocks, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit is '4' for 440-449, adding 10.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place, totaling 89 numbers.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes 1 '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488), adding 1.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400, there are 4 blocks, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit is '8' for 480-488, adding 9.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, I can figure out how many complete sets of ten there are in 488 and then add any extra numbers if there's an incomplete set at the end. \n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: In every set of one hundred numbers, the digit 4 appears ten times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. So, I can calculate how many complete hundreds there are and then see if there's an incomplete hundred at the end. \n\nFor the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, no, actually, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 is 88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nNow, let me calculate each place for 4's:\n\n1. Units place:\n   - There are 488 pages, so the number of complete tens is 48 (since 48*10 = 480). Each of these contributes 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place, so that's 48.\n   - Then, from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place. That's 1 more.\n   - So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - In every hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so that's 4*10 = 40.\n   - Now, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in 401-410, tens digit is 0; 410-419 is 1; ... up to 480-488, which is tens digit 8. So, in the 400-488 range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10.\n   - So total tens place 4's: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - As I thought earlier, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences.\n\nAdding them up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place:\n   - Similar to 4's, in every set of ten, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - Number of complete tens: 48 (since 48*10=480). So, 48 occurrences.\n   - From 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 488 has an 8 in the units place. That's 1 more.\n   - So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - In every hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so that's 4*10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but actually, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n   - So total tens place 8's: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding them up: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 occurrences of the digit 8.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then from 481-488, only 484 has a 4 in units, so +1. Total 49.\n- Tens: 4 hundreds, each 10, so 40. Then in 400-488, 440-449 is 10, so total 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full tens, 48. Then 488 has an 8, so +1. Total 49.\n- Tens: 4 hundreds, 40. Then in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9. Total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So yes, that's correct.\n\nFor the tens place in 4's, I considered 400-488 as 10 occurrences (440-449). That's correct because 440-449 is within 400-488.\n\nFor the tens place in 8's, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 starts at 480, which is 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but when I count from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers because 480 is included. So, yes, 9.\n\nWait, but in the units place for 8's, I added 1 for 488, which is correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every block of 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete blocks (1-480), contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - In the remaining pages (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, adding 1 more.\n   - **Total units place 4's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every block of 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 complete blocks (1-400), contributing 40 occurrences.\n   - In the range 400-488, 440-449 adds another 10 occurrences.\n   - **Total tens place 4's:** 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n   - **Total hundreds place 4's:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 pages. There are 48 complete blocks, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - In 481-488, 488 has an 8 in the units place, adding 1 more.\n   - **Total units place 8's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every block of 100 pages, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 complete blocks, contributing 40 occurrences.\n   - In 400-488, 480-488 adds 9 occurrences (since 480-488 is 9 pages).\n   - **Total tens place 8's:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place (pages go up to 488).\n   - **Total hundreds place 8's:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once. How many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each of those 48 sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the digit 4 in the tens place appears in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, in each 100 numbers, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Then, in the next 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 in each hundred. Specifically, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the tens digit goes up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place beyond the 400s? Well, in 400-499, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 occurrences. But since we only go up to 488, we don't have all of 440-449. Wait, actually, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, in the tens place, we have 40 (from the four full hundreds) plus 10 (from 440-449), totaling 50. Wait, no, hold on. Actually, the first four hundreds (1-400) would each have a block of 10 where the tens digit is 4, so that's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the next block where the tens digit is 4 is 440-449, which is another 10. So, total tens place 4's are 40+10=50.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because when we consider the hundreds place, 400-499, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. But since the book only goes up to 488, does that affect the count? Let me check. 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, the total for tens place is 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 440-449), making 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's are units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, 8 appears in blocks of 100. In each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? Four full hundreds (1-400). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Units: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in 481-488, 8 appears once, so 49. Tens: 4 full hundreds, each with 10, so 40, plus from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9, making 49. So, yes, 49+49=98.\n\nWait, no, that's units and tens. So, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, so total 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place was 49 and the tens place was 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:187, total 8's:98. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me verify my counts again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488//10=48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear. So, 48.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's:48+50+89=187.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9. So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: None, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, the last group is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, so the units digit goes from 1 to 8, and 4 is included here. So actually, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place because 488 is the last page, and 488 includes a 4 in the units place when considering 480-488? Wait, no, 488 is 4-8-8, so the units digit is 8. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times because each full ten contributes one 4, and the last partial ten (481-488) doesn't include a 4 in the units place. Wait, 481 is 4-8-1, so units digit is 1, then 482 is 2, up to 488. So, the units digit doesn't have a 4 in the last partial ten. So, 48 times for the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49 in each hundred. So, from 1-488, how many times does this happen? Well, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 1-100: 40-49, that's 10 times. 101-200: 140-149, another 10 times. 201-300: 240-249, another 10 times. 301-400: 340-349, another 10 times. Then, 401-488: 440-449, which is another 10 times, right? Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 times. Wait, but let me check: 1-100: 10 times, 101-200: 10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, 401-488:10. So, 5 times 10 is 50. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, in each group of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many complete groups of 10? 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Now, the last group is 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit 8 appears once more here. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers, specifically from 80-89 in each hundred. So, from 1-100: 80-89, 10 times. 101-200: 180-189, 10 times. 201-300: 280-289, 10 times. 301-400: 380-389, 10 times. 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each of the first four hundreds, and 9 times in the last partial hundred. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 1-100: 80-89:10, 101-200:180-189:10, 201-300:280-289:10, 301-400:380-389:10, 401-488:480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98 times.\n\nWait, so 4's appear 187 times, and 8's appear 98 times. So, the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 times\n- Tens: 50 times\n- Hundreds: 89 times\nTotal: 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. I said from 1-100:40-49 (10), 101-200:140-149 (10), 201-300:240-249 (10), 301-400:340-349 (10), and 401-488:440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems right.\n\nAnd for 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full sets (1-400) each contributing 10, and then 480-488 contributing 9, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place for 4's, I had 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, since the book ends at 488, there's no 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, the total 4's:187, 8's:98. Difference:89.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that means there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, the last set goes up to 480, so the next number is 481, which is still within 488. So, 481-488 would have 484 as the next occurrence of 4 in the units place, so that's actually 49 times in the units place. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. Let me check: from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is calculated by how many complete decades there are. Each decade (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) contributes one 4 in the units place. The number of complete decades is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), but actually, each decade is 10 numbers, so 488 pages mean 48 full decades and 8 extra pages. So, in each of the 48 full decades, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Then, in the last partial decade, which is 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 fall into this? Yes, 484 is in this partial decade, so that's one more 4 in the units place. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The first page is 1, so the first 4 in the units place is page 4, then 14, 24,... up to 484. So how many terms are in this sequence? The nth term would be 10n - 6, but maybe a better way is to see that the last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So yes, 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? For the tens digit, it's similar but a bit different. Each hundred contains 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). So for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? The tens digit is 4 for numbers 440-449, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So that's another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more. So total in the tens place is 40 +10=50 times. Wait, but let me check: from 1-400, the tens digit 4 appears 40 times (4 times 10). Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times. So total 50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers, right? 488-400=88. So in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. So the tens digit 4 occurs once every 100 numbers, so in 401-488, it's only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 10 times. So total 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400-488. So from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So total in the hundreds place is 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first number with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So yes, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So 4's appear 188 times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. That's 48 times. Now, in the last partial decade, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included. So 488 is the 49th occurrence of 8 in the units place. So total in units place is 48 +1=49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: The first occurrence is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So how many terms? The nth term is 10n - 2. So when does 10n -2 \u2264488? 10n \u2264490, so n\u226449. So n=49, so 49 times. So yes, 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred contains 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 1 to 488, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each full hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So total in the tens place is 40 +9=49 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So yes, 40+9=49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So the hundreds place contributes 0 times.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89 (10 times), 180-189 (10 times), 280-289 (10 times), 380-389 (10 times), and 480-488 (9 times). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 times. That seems right.\n\nAnd for the 8's in the tens place, I think I correctly accounted for 49 times, including the partial set in 480-488.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. For each position, I'll calculate how many 4's and 8's appear. \n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete block of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once (e.g., 8, 18, 28, etc.). Therefore, for 48 complete blocks, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. \n\nNow, I need to check the partial block from 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal. \n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each (for 10-19, 20-29, etc.). So, in each block of 100 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. \n\nSince we're dealing with 488 pages, there are four complete blocks of 100 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488. \n\nIn each complete block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for four blocks, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place. \n\nNow, the partial block from 401-488. The tens digit here ranges from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). Let's see: from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-488, where the tens digit is 8. \n\nLooking for 4's in the tens place: the only time the tens digit is 4 is in 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 10 4's in the tens place here. \n\nFor 8's in the tens place, we have 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place here. \n\nTherefore, in the partial block, we have 10 4's and 9 8's in the tens place. \n\nAdding that to the four complete blocks: 40 + 10 = 50 4's and 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100-488. \n\nFrom 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nThe digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0. \n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, we have 89 4's and 0 8's. \n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place. \n\nStarting with the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, for the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. Earlier, I thought in the partial block, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488), but actually, in the tens place, each block of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit, but in the partial block, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place in the partial block. So, total 8's in tens place would be 40 (from four blocks) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place, both 4's and 8's have 49 each, so that's correct. \n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, we have 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40, plus in the partial block, 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, totaling 50.\n\nIn the units place, 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 4, so 48, plus in the partial block, 484, so 1 more, totaling 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nIn the hundreds place, 0.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 blocks contributing 10 each, so 40, plus in the partial block, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, totaling 49.\n\nIn the units place, 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 8, so 48, plus in the partial block, 488, so 1 more, totaling 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the hundreds place correct? From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 10 in 440-449, total 50.\n\nUnits place: 48*1 +1=49.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nTens place: 4 blocks *10=40, plus 9 in 480-488=49.\n\nUnits place: 48*1 +1=49.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I'm counting correctly in the tens place for 8's. Let me think about the partial block again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place in the partial block. So, 40+9=49, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in the partial block, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nSo, I think the counts are correct. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
