    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by counting the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages and then see how many 4's and 8's are in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: Every block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49) and 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (80-89). So, I can figure out how many times each digit appears in the tens place by dividing the total number of pages by 100 and then multiplying by 10. But I have to be careful if the total isn't a multiple of 100, so I might need to adjust for the remaining pages.\n\nFor the hundreds place: Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 400-488, which is 89 numbers. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, yes, only 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 pages. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's tackle the units and tens places.\n\nStarting with the units digit:\n\nTotal pages: 488. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10 and 8 extra pages (481-488). In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Plus, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does the digit 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at 484. So, that's one more 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: In each group of 10, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the remaining 8 pages, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, does 8 appear in the units place? Yes, at 488. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but that would mean both 4's and 8's appear 49 times in the units place. But let me check: For the units digit, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Every 10 numbers, so 48 times, plus in the last partial group, 484 is the only one with 4 in the units place. So, 48 +1=49. Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers, 48 times, plus 488, so 48 +1=49. So, same count for both in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nFor the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.). Similarly, for 8, it's 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nSo, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of the 4 complete blocks, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40. Similarly, for 8, 4*10=40.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see:\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-409) to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: From 401-488, the tens digits are 0 (401-409), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), 3 (430-439), 4 (440-449), 5 (450-459), 6 (460-469), 7 (470-479), 8 (480-488). So, yes, 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 4 blocks *10=40, plus 10 in the partial block, so 50.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks *10=40, plus 9 in the partial block, so 49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the digit positions:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 488 pages, so 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing one 4 and one 8 in units place. So, 48 each, plus the last 8 pages (481-488). In these, 484 has a 4 in units, and 488 has an 8. So, 48+1=49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 40 each.\n- Then, 401-488: Tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers with 4 in tens place, and 480-488 is 9 numbers with 8 in tens place.\nSo, total 4's in tens: 40 +10=50\nTotal 8's in tens: 40 +9=49\n\nHundreds place:\n- Only 400-488 have 4 in hundreds place, which is 89 pages. So, 89 4's.\n- No 8's in hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should approach this by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. But since we're starting from 1, the first block is 1-10, where 0 doesn't appear, but 1-9 do. Wait, actually, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 0 appears once in the units place at page 10. But since the problem is about digits printed, maybe 0 isn't counted because it's not a 4 or an 8. So, perhaps I can ignore 0s since they don't contribute to either count. Let me think. So, for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last group is 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in the units place, 4 appears once in 484, which is part of the 480-489 range. So, in the units place, we have 48 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, it also appears once every 10 numbers. So, same as above, 48 times. But wait, let me check the last few numbers. The last page is 488, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, in the units place, 8 appears 48 times as well.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is indeed 48 because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times as well. So, units place: 4 appears 48 times, 8 appears 48 times. So, the count is equal here.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, actually, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, etc., up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place from 1-100. Similarly, from 101-200, the tens digit cycles again, so 0-9 each appearing 10 times. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each.\n\nBut our book goes up to 488, so we have four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. So, let's calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4 in the tens place:\n\nIn each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, for four full hundreds (1-400), that's 4 times 10, which is 40 fours. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 40 times in the first 400 pages. Then, in 401-488, does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 401-410 has tens digit 0, 411-420 has 1, 421-430 has 2, 431-440 has 3, 441-450 has 4. Wait, no, 441-450 would have tens digit 4, but 441-450 is part of 401-488. So, from 441-450, that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's another 10 fours in the tens place. Then, from 451-488, the tens digits go from 5 to 8, but 8 only up to 488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 441-450, and then in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so no more 4's in the tens place beyond that. So, total fours in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50 fours.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, total 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nSimilarly, in each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, from 1-400, that's 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488. So, 480 is included, right? So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 in all of these, so that's 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 4 in the hundreds place: pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place: looking at pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, 89 - 0 = 89 more fours.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the difference is 187 fours minus 97 eights, which is 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 4 appears 48 times, 8 appears 48 times. That seems correct because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. Let me confirm:\n  - From 1-400, 4 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10=40.\n  - Then, in 401-488, 441-450 adds another 10, so 40+10=50.\n  - For 8 in the tens place:\n    - From 1-400, 4*10=40.\n    - In 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488 inclusive). Let me check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages.\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nTotal fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\nTotal eights: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, another thought: when counting the hundreds place, does 400 count as one page, so 400 is included, making it 89 pages. Yes, because 488 - 400 = 88, but since we include both endpoints, it's 89.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, when I counted 480-488 as 9 numbers, that's correct because 488 - 480 = 8, but including both endpoints, it's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the difference is 90 fours more than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Did I count all the digits correctly? Let me go through each place again.\n\nUnits place:\n- 48 fours, 48 eights.\n\nTens place:\n- 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nSo, adding up: fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\nEights: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total units place occurrences:\n     - 4: 48 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles).\n     - 8: 48 times.\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - For 4:\n     - 400 pages: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n     - 401-488: 441-450 contributes 10 more.\n     - Total: 50 times.\n   - For 8:\n     - 400 pages: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n     - 401-488: 480-488 contributes 9 more.\n     - Total: 49 times.\n\n3. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488: 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\n4. **Summing Up the Counts:**\n   - Total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n   - Total 8's: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by counting the number of 4's in each place.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every group of ten pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten and then 8 more pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the full groups, plus one more time in the last partial group (pages 481-488). Wait, no, actually, the last group is 481-488, but the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place in this last group as well. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, but wait, when I think about it, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, meaning 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once. So, yes, 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire set of ten pages. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten pages. How many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, the first set is 40-49, the next would be 140-149, then 240-249, and 340-349. Each of these contributes ten 4's in the tens place. Then, after 349, the next set would be 440-449, but wait, 449 is within 488, so that's another ten. Wait, but 440-449 is part of the 400-488 range. So, let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. From 40-49: 10 times. From 140-149: another 10. From 240-249: another 10. From 340-349: another 10. From 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on, does 440-449 count as a separate set? Yes, because the tens digit is 4. So, total 5 sets, each with 10 pages, so 50 times. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400-488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds. That would be 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each group of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then the last partial group (481-488) has units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive pages: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 pages, right? So, how does that affect the count?\n\nLet me think. Each full set of ten where the tens digit is 8 contributes 10 8's. So, starting from 80-89: 10 pages. Then 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages here.\n\nSo, how many full sets of ten with tens digit 8 are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four sets, each contributing 10 8's. So, 4*10=40. Then, the partial set 480-488 contributes 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds. That's 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times.\n\nWait, so 4's appear 188 times, and 8's appear 98 times. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems right.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is ten pages, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 4's. That adds up to 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay.\n\nNow, for the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups, each with one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: four sets, each contributing 10 8's, so 40. Then, 480-488 is nine pages, contributing nine more 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since 800-899 isn't part of the book. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 80-89, that's 10 pages. Then 180-189, another 10. 280-289, another 10. 380-389, another 10. That's four sets, 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is nine pages because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is nine pages, right? So, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488). So, that's nine pages where the tens digit is 8. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another ten pages. So, that's five sets, each contributing ten 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of ten (1-480) contribute 48 fours. The last group (481-488) adds 1 more. Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** Sets 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each contribute 10 fours. Total: 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups contribute 48 eights. The last group adds 1 more. Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** Sets 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10 eights. The last partial set (480-488) adds 9. Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No pages contribute as 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's and 8's in the units place. For the units digit, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to page 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10, and then an extra 8 pages (481 to 488). So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 blocks would give 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Now, the extra 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in these, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. Hmm, so that's a tie so far. Now, let's move on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each block of 100, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, how many blocks of 100 are there in 488 pages? Well, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of these 4 hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, 4 and 8 each contribute 10 counts in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's look at the partial hundred from 401 to 488. The tens digit here cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digits in 401-409 are 0, 401-410: 0, 411-420: 1, and so on up to 480-488: 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, our range is only up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all, so that's 9 times. Wait, but in the tens place, each full ten (like 480-489) would have 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nWait, but hold on, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, in the tens place, for 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous 40 counts from the four full hundreds, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, so far, 4 is ahead by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, and the next hundred would be 500-599, which isn't part of this book. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits across units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 401-488, I thought 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). But wait, 440-449 is 10 pages, so that's correct. 480-488 is 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times. So, in the tens place, 4's: 10, 8's:9.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 pages.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for the units digit. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the units place, I considered that each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8. So, from 1 to 480, that's 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place 4's: 48 +1=49, same for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for the four full hundreds, each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times). So, 10 and 9, adding to 50 and 49 respectively. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place would have more, but 90 seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: Maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nCalculating 4's:\n\n- Units place: For every 10 pages, one 4. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48 +1=49.\n\n- Tens place: For every 100 pages, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens place 4's:40 +10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's:49 +50 +89=188.\n\nCalculating 8's:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Plus in the last partial ten (481-488), units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48 +1=49.\n\n- Tens place: In each hundred, 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds contribute 4*10=40. In the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: No 8's, as before.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each block of 10 pages has one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 full blocks (480 pages) contribute 48 each.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 49, 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each block of 100 pages has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds (400 pages) contribute 40 each.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 50, 8's: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - Pages 400-488 have the hundreds digit as 4, contributing 89 4's.\n   - No 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference**: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each position one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's and 8's in the units place. For the units digit, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each of these 48 blocks, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. That gives 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place. But wait, we also have the last 8 numbers: 481-488. Let me check the units digits here: 481 has 1, 482 has 2, 483 has 3, 484 has 4, 485 has 5, 486 has 6, 487 has 7, 488 has 8. So, in these, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, there's one more 4 (at 484) and one more 8 (at 488). So, adding these, the total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times, 49 each. Hmm, so maybe the difference comes from the tens and hundreds places.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each of the 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40 4's, and similarly, 8's would be 4 * 10 = 40. Now, we need to check the last partial hundred, which is 401-488. Let's see the tens digits here. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nFirst, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488), so that's 9 times. So, in the tens place, in 401-488, we have 10 4's and 9 8's. Therefore, adding to the previous counts:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 4*10 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 4*10 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 (from 401-488) = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is ahead by 1 here.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so 4 and 8 can't appear there. Pages 100-488 have a hundreds digit. The hundreds digit cycles every 1000, but since we only go up to 488, the hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nEach hundreds digit from 1 to 3 appears 100 times each (e.g., 100-199 has hundreds digit 1, 200-299 has 2, etc.), and the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). Wait, let me check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, do 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, 4 does, as we just saw, but 8 doesn't because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, now let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFirst, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me see: from 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, so 100 times. 200-299, 100 times. 300-399, 100 times. 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times. So, total hundreds digits: 100+100+100+89=389. But wait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place, 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nTens place: 4's: 50, 8's: 49.\n\nUnits place: 49 each.\n\nSo, 4's total: 89 + 50 + 49 = 89 + 50 is 139, plus 49 is 188.\n\n8's total: 0 + 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - In each block of 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - Each contributes 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contains 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - For 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds (400 pages) and a partial hundred (401-488).\n   - In the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, for 48 complete blocks, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).

In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. Now, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra numbers (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 complete blocks, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 times 10 is 40. Similarly, for 8, it's 10 times per block, so 4 blocks give 40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear here. \n\nFrom 401-409: tens digit is 0. So, no 4 or 8 here. From 410-419: tens digit is 1. Again, no 4 or 8. From 420-429: tens digit is 2. No. From 430-439: tens digit is 3. No. From 440-449: tens digit is 4. Here, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears. Similarly, from 450-459: tens digit is 5. No. 460-469: tens digit is 6. No. 470-479: tens digit is 7. No. 480-488: tens digit is 8. Here, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times. \n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, in the incomplete block, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times. \n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 10 from the incomplete block, total 50. Tens place 8's: 4 blocks *10=40, plus 9 from the incomplete block, total 49. \n\nSo, so far, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's: 49.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, in 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which doesn't count. From 100-199: hundreds digit is 1. 200-299: 2. 300-399:3. 400-488:4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract 8's from 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8, so 48 each. Then, in 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 48+1=49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 to 4 and 10 to 8, so 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449 (10 times) and 8 appears from 480-488 (9 times). So, 4's: 10, 8's:9. So, total 4's:40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 8's:0. So, 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, seems correct. I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. We analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 48 complete blocks of 10 give 48 occurrences each.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add 1 each.\n   - Total 4's: 49, 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 4 complete blocks of 100 give 40 each.\n   - In 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 for 4, and 480-488 adds 9 for 8.\n   - Total 4's: 50, 8's: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488 (89 numbers) gives 89 for 4.\n   - No 8's in hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by counting the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. So, for each 10 pages, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, but wait, no. Actually, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place, except maybe the last partial set. Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each digit, the count in the units place would be 48 times for each digit except maybe the last few. Wait, no, because 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the units digit from 1 to 488 would have each digit from 0 to 9 appearing 48 times, except the digit 8, which appears one more time in the last partial set (481-488). Wait, no, because in the last 8 pages, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, for units digit 8, it appears once more. So, for units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, but wait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each digit 0-9 appearing 48 times) plus the last 8 pages, which add digits 1-8. So, digits 1-8 each get an extra count. So, for units digit, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but in the units place, does 8 appear 49 times? Because in the last set, 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so yes, 8 appears once more. So, units place: 4's = 48, 8's = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, since we have 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in the tens place, for each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times each. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total in tens place: 4 appears 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times. 8 appears 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8's in hundreds place = 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 187 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each 10 pages, 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full sets of 10, so 48 times each, plus the last 8 pages where units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, 48 for 4, 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred, 10 times each digit in tens place. So, 4 full hundreds: 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8.\n- Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., 8 for 480-488. So, 4 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449, that's 10 pages, so 10 times. 8 appears when tens digit is 8, which is 480-488, that's 9 pages, so 9 times. So, total for tens place: 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8. That looks correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit is 4 only. So, 0 for 8. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 +50 +89=187\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\nDifference:187 -98=89\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, did I count the hundreds place correctly? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? 488 -400 +1=89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in hundreds place.\n\nAnother way to check: Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nUnits place:\n- 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once more. So, units place: 4's=48, 8's=49.\n\nTens place:\n- For each hundred, 10 times each digit in tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times per hundred, 8 appears 10 times per hundred.\n- 4 hundreds: 4*10=40 each.\n- Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for 4 in tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, adding 10 and 9 respectively. So, total tens place: 4's=50, 8's=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up: 4's=48+50+89=187, 8's=49+49+0=98. Difference is 89.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: Maybe I can write a small program or use another method to verify, but since I'm doing this manually, I think my counts are correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place from 1 to 480.\n- From 481 to 488, digit 8 appears once more.\n- **Total 4's in units place:** 48\n- **Total 8's in units place:** 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 times for each digit in 400 pages.\n- From 401 to 488, digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- **Total 4's in tens place:** 50\n- **Total 8's in tens place:** 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- Digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- Digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n- **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should count the occurrences of 4 and 8 separately for each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. Let's start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an additional 8 pages (481 to 488). So, in each of the 48 complete blocks, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. That gives us 48 fours and 48 eights from the units place. But wait, the last partial block is from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. Let's check the units digits here: 481 has 1, 482 has 2, 483 has 3, 484 has 4, 485 has 5, 486 has 6, 487 has 7, and 488 has 8. So, in the units place of the last partial block, there's one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, that adds one more 4 and one more 8. Therefore, total fours in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Total eights in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So, so far, the count is equal for units place.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each set of 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488. So, in each complete hundred, we have 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. Therefore, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights. Now, let's check the partial hundred from 401-488. The tens digit here cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 times, and the digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So, in the partial hundred, we have 10 fours and 9 eights in the tens place. So, adding that to the previous counts: total fours in tens place = 40 + 10 = 50. Total eights in tens place = 40 + 9 = 49. So, so far, fours are leading by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers, so from 100-488. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Each hundreds digit appears for 100 numbers, except the last one, which might be shorter. So, from 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times. Similarly, 200-299 has 2, 300-399 has 3, and 400-488 has 4. Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8? Well, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because the highest hundreds digit is 4. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours and 0 eights. So, adding that to our previous counts: total fours in hundreds place = 89. Total eights in hundreds place = 0. So, now, total fours overall would be units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. And total eights would be units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. Let me think again. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's there. From 200-299, same, hundreds digit is 2. From 300-399, hundreds digit is 3. From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, as I thought. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8's in hundreds place are 0.\n\nWait, but let me check the units and tens place again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each. Then the last partial block (481-488) contributes one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 + 1 = 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds give 40 fours and 40 eights. Then, the partial hundred (401-488) has the tens digit from 0 to 8. So, for fours in tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. For eights in tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 9 = 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position separately.\n\nLet's consider units digit first:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place: For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total number of tens is 488 // 10 = 48 full tens, contributing 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units place, so +1. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n\nSimilarly, number of times 8 appears in units place: Same as above, 48 full tens contributing 48 eights, and in the last 8 numbers, 488 has an 8, so +1. Total 48 +1 = 49 eights.\n\nNow, tens digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place: For every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). So, 488 // 100 = 4 full hundreds, contributing 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Then, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488) have their tens digits from 0 to 8. In the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10. So, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, number of times 8 appears in tens place: For every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, 4 full hundreds contribute 4 * 10 = 40 eights. The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) have their tens digits from 0 to 8. 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, +9. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 fours.\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in hundreds place: Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 50\n\nHundreds: 89\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal eights:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 49\n\nHundreds: 0\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, maybe 90 is the correct answer. But I feel like that's a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. Let me recount the hundreds digit.\n\nFrom page 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is:\n\n- 0 for pages 1-99\n\n- 1 for pages 100-199\n\n- 2 for pages 200-299\n\n- 3 for pages 300-399\n\n- 4 for pages 400-488\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, let me think about the tens digit again. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit being 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. For the tens digit being 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, that's correct.\n\nUnits digit: 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 and one 8. So, units digits: 49 each.\n\nSo, adding up, fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nEights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Maybe I was overcomplicating it. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and 8 additional pages (481-488).\n   - 48 fours and 48 eights from complete blocks.\n   - 1 four (484) and 1 eight (488) from the last 8 pages.\n   - **Total:** 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete hundreds (400 pages) contribute 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - The last 88 pages (401-488) contribute 10 fours (440-449) and 9 eights (480-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total:** 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **Fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **Eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should count the number of 4's and 8's separately in each position: units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the same for 8 (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, I can figure out how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages and then see how many 4's and 8's are in the units place.\n\nLet's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and a partial group of 8 pages. In each complete group, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 groups, that's 48 times 4's and 48 times 8's. But wait, that's only for the units place. I also need to consider the partial group from 481 to 488. In this partial group, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding that to the units place, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8, not 9. So, in the last partial group, the units digits are 1 through 8, which includes 4 and 8. So, yes, each gets one more. So, units place gives 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49) and the same for 8 (80-89). So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Let's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the partial hundred from 401-488. The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred.\n\nBut wait, in the partial hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, the digit 4 in the tens place is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding that to the complete hundreds, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 4*10 + 10 = 50, and the total number of 8's is 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, tens place contributes 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488 and 3 for 300-399, etc. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Total pages: 488\n- Each 10 pages have one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1 to 4's and 1 to 8's, so 48 each.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4's and 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n- 4 complete hundreds: 4*10 = 40 for both.\n- Partial hundred (401-488): tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n- 4 in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n- 8 in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n- So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 89 numbers.\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place. So, 89 4's and 0 8's. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for the partial hundred. Let me check again.\n\nIn the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, there are 10 numbers (except possibly the last one if it's cut short). But in this case, 488 is the last page, so for tens digit 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times, not 10. So, that part is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, yes, 10 for 4 and 9 for 8 in the tens place for the partial hundred.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nLet me try calculating the number of 4's first.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place:\n  - For each 10 pages, 1 occurrence.\n  - Total groups of 10: 48 full groups (480 pages) plus 8 pages.\n  - 48*1 + 1 (from 484) = 49\n\n- Tens place:\n  - For each 100 pages, 10 occurrences in the tens place.\n  - 4 full hundreds: 4*10 = 40\n  - In the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449: 10 occurrences.\n  - Total: 40 + 10 = 50\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - From 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place:\n  - Same as 4's: 48 full groups + 1 in the last partial group (488)\n  - Total: 49\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4 full hundreds: 4*10 = 40\n  - In the partial hundred (401-488), tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488: 9 occurrences.\n  - Total: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nSo, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach to confirm. Maybe using a formula or another method to count digit occurrences.\n\nI remember that for a given digit d in a certain position, the number of times it appears can be calculated by considering higher digits, current digit, and lower digits. But maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, I can think of each digit place separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small program or use a formula to compute the number of times a digit appears in each position. But since I'm doing this manually, let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nWait, I think my initial calculation is correct. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each position one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of times 4 appears in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles through 0-9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. But wait, the book ends at 488, so I need to check how many complete blocks of 10 there are and whether the last block is complete.\n\nTotal number of pages is 488, so how many complete tens are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete tens and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once in each of the 48 complete tens, and then in the last partial block (481-488), does 4 appear? Let's see: 484 is within 481-488, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second, let me check that again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Each 10 numbers contribute one 4, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial ten, which is 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 has a 4 in the units place. So that's one more, making it 49. So, units place: 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many hundreds are there? Let's see: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, in 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. Now, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks is that? 1-99: 1 block, 100-199: 2nd block, 200-299: 3rd, 300-399: 4th, 400-488: 5th. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, in the last block, 440-449, that's within 400-488, so that's fine. So, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 440-449 is part of the 400-488 range, so yes, that's correct. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 4's in the tens place, so 50.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 occurrences. So, hundreds place: 89.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89). So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in each block of 10, the digit 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete tens are there? 48 complete tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more, making it 49.\n\nWait, but wait: 488 is the last page, so in the units place, 8 appears once in each block of 10, so 48 full blocks (1-480) would have 48 eights, and then 488 adds one more, so total 49.\n\nNow, tens place: The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are.\n\nFrom 1-488, the blocks are:\n\n1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers)\n100-199: 180-189 (10)\n200-299: 280-289 (10)\n300-399: 380-389 (10)\n400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, in the last block, 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so the numbers are 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, how many eights in the tens place here? 9, not 10.\n\nSo, let's calculate:\n\n1-99: 10\n100-199: 10\n200-299: 10\n300-399: 10\n400-488: 9\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that adds up to 49? Wait, 10+10+10+10 is 40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would occur in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 98.\n\nWait, so 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, units place: earlier I thought it was 49, but let me confirm. Each block of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8, adding one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. So, how many more 4's than 8's? 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 49\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 10 each, totaling 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, plus 484 in the last partial block, so 49. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks each contribute 10, but the last block only contributes 9, so 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 48 full tens, plus 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised because I thought maybe 8's would be more, but no, 4's are more by 90.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by considering each digit position separately, using a formula.\n\nFor a given digit d in a certain position, the number of times it appears can be calculated based on higher digits and lower digits.\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating it. My initial approach seems correct.\n\nWait, another way: Let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, which it is (488's last digit is 8, which is >=4, so add 1 more if the last digit is exactly 4. Wait, no, in the units place, the number of 4's is floor((n + 9) / 10). Wait, maybe a better formula is:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place from 1 to N:\n\ncount = (N // 10) + min(max(N % 10 - d + 1, 0), 1)\n\nWait, maybe that's more accurate.\n\nSo, for 4's in units place:\n\nN = 488\n\ncount = 488 // 10 = 48\n\nremainder = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nif remainder >= 4, add 1, else 0.\n\nSo, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\ncount = 488 // 10 = 48\n\nremainder = 8\n\nif remainder >=8, add 1, else 0.\n\nSo, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in tens place from 1 to N:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10\n\nremainder = N % 100\n\nif remainder >= 10*d, add 10*d, else add remainder - 10*d +1\n\nWait, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, for the tens place, each digit d appears in a block of 100, 10 times per block. So, for N=488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 (since 4*100=400). So, count = 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, the remaining part is 88. So, in the remaining 88 numbers, how many times does digit d appear in the tens place.\n\nIf d is 4, then in the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Since 40-49 is within 400-488, so that's 10 more.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 40-49 in the tens place would be 440-449? Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better formula is:\n\nFor tens place digit d:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10\n\nremainder = N % 100\n\nif the tens digit in remainder is greater than d, add 10\n\nif it's equal to d, add (remainder % 10 + 1)\n\nif it's less, add 0.\n\nWait, let me try this for d=4 and N=488.\n\nN=488\n\ncount = (488 // 100) * 10 = 4 * 10 = 40\n\nremainder = 88\n\ntens digit in remainder is 8.\n\nSince 8 > 4, add 10.\n\nSo total count = 40 +10=50. Which matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n\ncount = (488 // 100) * 10 =4*10=40\n\nremainder=88\n\ntens digit in remainder is 8.\n\nSince 8 >=8, add (8 % 10 +1)=8+1=9.\n\nSo total count=40 +9=49. Which matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place:\n\nFor d=4, N=488.\n\ncount = (488 // 1000) * 100 =0\n\nremainder=488\n\nhundreds digit in remainder is 4.\n\nSince 4 >=4, add (488 % 100 +1)=88 +1=89.\n\nSo, count=0 +89=89.\n\nFor d=8 in hundreds place:\n\ncount = (488 // 1000)*100=0\n\nremainder=488\n\nhundreds digit in remainder is 4 <8, so add 0.\n\nSo, total count=0.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier counts.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think of another way. Maybe by considering each digit place separately and using the formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small table for each digit position and count occurrences.\n\nBut I think my earlier approach is solid, and the formula confirms it.\n\nSo, I'm confident the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 fours. Additionally, the number 484 adds one more, totaling 49 fours.\n- **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 eights.\n- **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The first four blocks contribute 40 eights, and the last partial block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by counting the number of 4's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra pages. So, in each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place of these, does 4 appear? Yes, at 484. So that's one more 4. So total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place: Similarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of ten numbers, like 40-49. Each such block contributes ten 4's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, the first block is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's five blocks. Each block contributes ten 4's in the tens place, so that's 5 * 10 = 50. Now, wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNext, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's would be units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Just like with 4, for every set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, up to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? As before, 48 complete sets and 8 extra pages. So, 48 8's in the units place from the complete sets. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 8 appears once at 488. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each complete block (like 80-89, etc.) contributes ten 8's in the tens place. So, how many complete blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 is the first, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, the first four blocks are complete, each contributing ten 8's, and the last block contributes nine 8's in the tens place. Wait, no, actually, 480-488 is nine numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's nine 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place would be 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last partial block, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 80-89: 10 8's, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's would be units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in the units place, from 1-488, each ten has one 8, so 48 sets, plus 8 in 488, so 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place: Each hundred has one block of ten with 8 in the tens place, so 400-488: 480-488 is a partial block, contributing 9 8's. So, 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10 8's, that's 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated 4's, I had 188, and 8's as 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's.\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, every ten numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 4's in units.\n\nTens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has ten 4's in the tens place. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: Same as 4's, 48 full tens, each with one 8, so 48, plus 8 in 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: No 8's, as before.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98 8's.\n\nSo, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnd for the 8's in the tens place, I think that's correct too. So, 98 8's.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I counted the 4's in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing ten 4's, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 49 4's, and hundreds place 89. So, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 98.\n\nThus, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the 8's in the tens place. Let me recount that.\n\nFrom 80-89:10 8's in the tens place.\n\n180-189:10.\n\n280-289:10.\n\n380-389:10.\n\n480-488:9.\n\nSo, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 488 pages. So, page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider whether the counting includes page 488. So, in the units place, 488 ends with an 8, so that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 488 has an 8 in the tens place, so that's included in the 480-488 block.\n\nWait, but in the 480-488 block, the tens digit is 8, so all those pages have 8 in the tens place, which is correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:188\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more '4's are printed than '8's.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '4's.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one '4' (484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - '4' appears in the tens place for blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 '4's, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every 10 numbers, '8' appears once in the units place.\n   - 48 complete sets contribute 48 '8's.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one '8' (488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - '8' appears in the tens place for blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 '8's each, totaling 40.\n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 '8's.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No '8's appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Let me start by counting the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each block of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4), and 8 appears once (page 8). Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of ten and then a partial block of 8 pages (481-488). So, in each full block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. Therefore, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear once more in the units place? Yes, at page 484. Similarly, 8 appears once at page 488. So, adding that, the units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's. Wait, no, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. So, units place contributes equally.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in pages 40-49, which is 10 times, and 8 in pages 80-89, also 10 times. So, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. How many hundreds are there in 488? There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is 4*100 + 88, so there are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, that's 4*10 = 40 4's and 4*10 = 40 8's. Now, what about the last partial hundred, 401-488? The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in pages 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in pages 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but the hundreds digit is 4, so the tens digit is 8 for all these pages. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. But wait, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, in the tens place for 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, total for tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50 4's, and 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For the full hundreds (1-400), each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more 4's. The tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more 8's. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's: 40 +9=49. So, tens place contributes 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400 to 488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. The hundreds digit 8 would appear in pages 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. So, hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nWait, but actually, in the hundreds place, each page number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages, so 800-899 isn't present. So, hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the units place. Earlier, I thought that in the units place, from 1-480, there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 for 4's and 48 +1=49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), we have 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 50 4's and 49 8's in tens place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding up, 4's: 49 +50 +89=188, 8's:49 +49 +0=98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. Correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: for each digit place, units, tens, hundreds, count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach. For each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFor units place:\nIn each block of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, total number of blocks in 488 pages is floor(488/10)=48 full blocks, and then a remainder of 8 pages (481-488). So, units place: 48*1 +1=49 for 4's and 48*1 +1=49 for 8's.\n\nFor tens place:\nIn each block of 100, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 and 8, each appears 10 times per hundred. So, for 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Then, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) would have their tens digits from 0-8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, total tens place: 4*10 +10=50 for 4's, and 4*10 +9=49 for 8's.\n\nFor hundreds place:\nIn 488 pages, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all the cases correctly. For example, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: for the tens digit, the number of times a digit d appears is calculated as follows:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in 488 pages, we have 4 full hundreds, contributing 4*10=40 for each digit 4 and 8. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for digit 4 in tens place, it's from 440-449, which is 10 pages. For digit 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds digit, only 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (480 pages) and a partial block of 8 pages (481-488).\n   - 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (400 pages), contributing 40 each.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear.\n   - 4's: 89\n   - 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds places. Let me start by considering each position one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of ten and then a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). Each full set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial set, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see, the first block is 40-49, which is one block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's five blocks. Each block contributes ten 4's in the tens place. So that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. So 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears once every ten numbers. So, how many full tens are there up to 488? As before, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, the partial set from 481-488 has units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for a block of ten numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So how many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has ten numbers, contributing ten 8's each, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all nine numbers, contributing 9 8's. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Each of those blocks contributes the correct number of 8's in the tens place. Units place seems correct as well. So, 49 + 49 = 98 8's.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 '4' in the units place.\n   - Up to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, plus a partial set (481-488) where 484 has a '4'.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every block of 100 numbers has 10 '4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is '4' for all 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to '4's, every 10 numbers contribute 1 '8'.\n   - Up to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, plus a partial set (481-488) where 488 has an '8'.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every block of 100 numbers has 10 '8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 5 such blocks, but the last block (480-488) only has 9 numbers.\n   - Total: (4 blocks \u00d7 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 numbers, each digit (including 4 and 8) appears exactly once in the units place. Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 48 times in the units place from the complete blocks. Now, the extra 8 numbers: 481-488. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, the tens place: In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and similarly for 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So, that's 4*10 = 40 times each. Now, from 401-488, we need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place. From 401-409, the tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8. From 410-419, the tens digit is 1, so no. Similarly, 420-429, tens digit is 2; 430-439, tens digit is 3; 440-449, tens digit is 4. So, in 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 times. Then, 450-459, tens digit 5; 460-469, tens digit 6; 470-479, tens digit 7; 480-488, tens digit 8. In 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 times because we only go up to 488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once more than 8.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up all occurrences:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

Let me start by considering each position one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in each position.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 blocks \u00d7 1 = 48 fours. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear here? Yes, at 484. So that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488). In each complete block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 0-8. Wait, let me think: from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 fours. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is after 401 and 449 is before 488. So that's another 10 fours. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours. So, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 48 blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 in the last partial block, total 49. Tens place: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449), so 10, making it 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, in the units place, every block of 10 has one 8. So, 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 8 appears once at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** In the tens place, the digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 has one such block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in 4 complete blocks of 100, that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Let me check: 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 in these 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on. The tens digit in 480-488 is 8, which is correct. So, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nSo, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Units place: 48 blocks \u00d71 =48, plus 1 in 488, so 49. Tens place: 4 blocks \u00d710=40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488), so 9, making 49. Hundreds place: 0. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digits go from 1-8, so 484 is the only one with a 4. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place (40-49, etc.), so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers, 488 has an 8 in units place, so 1. Total 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place (80-89, etc.), so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49 +49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When considering the tens place for 8's, in the last partial block, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. That's 9 numbers, right? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in the last partial block, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, 40 +10=50.\n\nSo, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach to confirm. Maybe using a formula or another counting method.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each position separately and calculate how many times the digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor(N/10) + min(remaining, 1) if the remaining is >=d.\n\nWait, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, for each position, the count can be calculated as:\n\nFor units place:\nNumber of 4's = (488 + 1) / 10 * 1 + (if 488 mod 10 >=4, then 1 else 0) - but wait, that might not be accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps a better formula is:\n\nFor a digit d and position p (units=1, tens=2, hundreds=3), the count can be calculated as:\n\nhigher = N / (p*10)\ncurrent = (N / p) % 10\nlower = N % p\n\ncount = higher * 10^(p-1)\n\nif current > d:\n    count += 10^(p-1)\nelif current == d:\n    count += lower + 1\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try applying this formula for 4's in each position.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to stick with my initial counting.\n\nWait, another thought: when counting 4's, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in the tens digit for 10 numbers every 100, so 4 blocks \u00d710=40, plus in the last partial block, 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, making 50.\n\nIn the units place, 48 blocks \u00d71=48, plus one more in 484, so 49.\n\nTotal 4's: 89 +50 +49=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nIn the hundreds place, 0.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 blocks \u00d710=40, plus in the last partial block, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, making 49.\n\nIn the units place, 48 blocks \u00d71=48, plus one more in 488, making 49.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems like a lot. Let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a 20-page book. How many 1's and 2's are there?\n\nPage numbers: 1-20.\n\nCounting 1's:\n\nUnits place: 1,11,21 (but 21 is beyond 20, so only 1 and 11. So, 2 ones.\n\nTens place: 10-19: 10 numbers, so 10 ones.\n\nTotal 1's: 2 +10=12.\n\nSimilarly, 2's:\n\nUnits place: 2,12,22 (22 is beyond, so 2 and 12: 2 twos.\n\nTens place: 20: 1 two.\n\nTotal 2's: 2 +1=3.\n\nSo, 1's:12, 2's:3. Difference:9.\n\nWait, but according to my method:\n\nFor 1's:\n\nUnits place: floor(20/10)=2 blocks, each contributing 1, so 2. Then, remaining 0, so no extra. So, 2.\n\nTens place: floor(20/100)=0 blocks, so 0. Then, in the last partial block (1-20), the tens digit is 1 for 10-19, which is 10 numbers. So, 10.\n\nTotal 1's:2+10=12.\n\nFor 2's:\n\nUnits place: floor(20/10)=2 blocks, each contributing 1, so 2. Remaining 0, so no extra. So, 2.\n\nTens place: floor(20/100)=0 blocks. Then, in the last partial block, the tens digit is 2 for 20, which is 1 number. So, 1.\n\nTotal 2's:2+1=3.\n\nDifference:12-3=9. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for this small example.\n\nSimilarly, let's try another example. How about a 50-page book.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place: floor(50/10)=5 blocks, each contributing 1, so 5. Remaining 0, so no extra. So, 5.\n\nTens place: floor(50/100)=0 blocks. Then, in the last partial block, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, 10.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 4's:5+10=15.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nUnits place: floor(50/10)=5 blocks, each contributing 1, so 5. Remaining 0, so no extra. So, 5.\n\nTens place: floor(50/100)=0 blocks. Then, in the last partial block, the tens digit is 8 for 40-49? Wait, no. Wait, 80-89 would be in 80-89, but 50 is less than 80, so in 1-50, the tens digit is 8 only for 80-89, which is beyond 50. So, in 1-50, the tens digit is 8 for 0 numbers. So, 0.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:5+0=5.\n\nDifference:15-5=10.\n\nWait, but according to manual count:\n\n4's: 4,14,24,34,44,40-49 (10 numbers). Wait, 40-49 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, and each also has a 4 in the units place for 44. Wait, but I'm counting all 4's, so in 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 fours, plus in the units place, 4,14,24,34,44, which is 5 fours. Wait, but 44 is already counted in both tens and units. So, total 4's:10 (tens) +5 (units) =15. Correct.\n\n8's: 8,18,28,38,48, which is 5 numbers, each with an 8 in the units place. So, 5 eights. So, difference 15-5=10. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works here too.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, I think my calculation is correct: 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe by writing a small program or using a formula.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the total number of digits used.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nWait, another thought: when counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nFor the tens place, 4's: in each hundred block, 40-49, 140-149, etc., which is 10 per block. So, 4 blocks \u00d710=40. Then, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10. So, total 50.\n\nUnits place: 48 blocks \u00d71=48, plus 484, so 49.\n\nTotal 4's:89+50+49=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTens place: in each hundred block, 80-89, 180-189, etc., which is 10 per block. So, 4 blocks \u00d710=40. Then, in the last partial block, 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9. Total 49.\n\nUnits place:48 blocks \u00d71=48, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the last partial block for 8's in the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers:440,441,...,449. So, 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nSo, yes, the counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm going to try another approach to confirm. Let me consider each digit position and calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- For 4's: every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, for 488 numbers, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's floor(488/10)=48 times, plus if the last partial block has a 4, which it does at 484, so 48+1=49.\n\n- For 8's: same logic, floor(488/10)=48, plus 488 has an 8 in units place, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). So, floor(488/100)=4 times, each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 50.\n\n- For 8's: same logic, floor(488/100)=4 times, each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\n- For 8's: the hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but since the book is only 488 pages, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough times, and each time the result is 90. So, I'm confident that the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1-488):**\n     - Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place. \n     - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 (1-480), contributing 48 '4's.\n     - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), '4' appears once at 484.\n     - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens Place (1-488):**\n     - Every 100 numbers, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n     - There are 4 complete blocks of 100 (1-400), contributing 4\u00d710=40 '4's.\n     - In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), '4' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (440-449).\n     - Total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place (1-488):**\n     - '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n     - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n   \n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place (1-488):**\n     - Similar to '4's, '8' appears once every 10 numbers.\n     - 48 complete blocks contribute 48 '8's.\n     - In the remaining 8 numbers, '8' appears once at 488.\n     - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens Place (1-488):**\n     - '8' appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n     - 4 complete blocks contribute 4\u00d710=40 '8's.\n     - In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), '8' appears in the tens place for 9 numbers (480-488).\n     - Total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place (1-488):**\n     - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n   \n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8' in the page numbers.  \n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by counting the number of 4's in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles through 0-9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no 4 there. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488). In each full hundred, there's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many 4's are in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 for 40-49, but since we're starting at 401, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 in the 400s. Wait, no, 401-488: the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490. But 488 is the last page, so the tens digits go up to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only for 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so another 10 4's in the tens place. So total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nAdding all these up: Units place 48, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. So total 4's = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So total 8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit is 8 for 10 consecutive numbers in each 100: 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many full hundreds are there? 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). In each, there's 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. But the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding up the 8's: Units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So total 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in units, so +1, total 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in the 400s, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So 40 + 9 = 49. So total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. That seems right.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 187 and 8's is 98. So, how many more 4's than 8's? 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's there. Units place: 48 times, tens place: 50 times. So 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: Units place is 49, tens place is 49, so 98. So 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct. So the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (once every 10 numbers, 48 full sets of 10, and none in the remaining 8).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (10 in each of the first 4 hundreds, and 10 in 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 full sets of 10, plus 1 in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (10 in each of the first 4 hundreds, and 9 in 480-488).\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each position one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's and 8's in the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place goes from 0 to 9. So, in each set, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same for 8. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in each of these 48 sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. That gives 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place. Now, the extra 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in the units place of these extra pages, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding that, units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the extra pages are 481-488, which is 8 pages. The units digits in these are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place total 4's: 48 (from complete sets) + 1 (extra) = 49. Similarly, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, that seems correct so far.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, right? So, in each block of 100 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place per 100 pages. So, how many complete 100-page blocks are there in 488 pages? Let me see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488). \n\nIn each of these 4 complete blocks, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49, 140-149, etc.), same for 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, each digit 4 and 8 appears 10 times per 100 pages. So, for 4 blocks, that's 4*10=40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. Now, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) need to be considered. Let's break this down. From 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit in this range is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-488. Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It would be when the tens digit is 4, which is from 440-449. But wait, our range is 401-488. So, 440-449 is within this range, right? So, that's 10 numbers (440 to 449), so the tens digit is 4 ten times. Similarly, how about 8 in the tens place? That's when the tens digit is 8, which is from 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is included and 488 is the last. Wait, actually, 480 to 489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages. \n\nSo, adding this to the previous counts: 4's in tens place: 40 (from 4 blocks) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. 8's in tens place: 40 (from 4 blocks) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. Wait, but wait, let me double-check that. In the remaining 88 pages, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410 (10 numbers), 1 for 411-420 (10 numbers), ..., up to 8 for 481-488 (8 numbers, since 488 is the last). So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times 4. When the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times 8. So, yes, 10 and 9. So, the total for 4's in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences. For 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nUnits place: For 488 pages, each 10 pages have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each 100 pages, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, same for 8. So, 4 blocks of 100 pages give 4*10=40 each. Then, the remaining 88 pages (401-488). In these, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. For 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up: 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: maybe calculate the total number of digits printed and see if the counts make sense. But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can think of a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit: as before, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8, plus the extra 8 pages. So, 48*1=48, plus in the extra 8 pages, 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So, 49 each.\n\nFor tens digit: 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full cycles of 100, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Then, the remaining 88 pages. For the tens digit in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 10 and 9 respectively. So, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 +10=50, 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds digit: as before, 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, adding up: 49 +50 +89=188 for 4's, and 49 +49 +0=98 for 8's. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach. For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nUnits digit:\n- For each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to N is given by:\n  - complete cycles: (N // 10) * 1\n  - plus the remainder: if the remainder >= d, add 1, else 0.\n\nBut in our case, for both 4 and 8, we can compute it.\n\nFor units digit 4:\n- N = 488\n- complete cycles = 488 // 10 = 48\n- remainder = 488 % 10 = 8\n- since 8 >=4, add 1\n- total = 48 +1 =49\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8:\n- complete cycles =48\n- remainder=8\n- since 8 >=8, add 1\n- total=48 +1=49\n\nTens digit:\nThe formula is a bit more complex. For the tens digit, each cycle is 100, and each digit appears 10 times per cycle.\n\nFor digit d in tens place:\n- number of complete cycles = N // 100\n- remainder = N % 100\n- if remainder >= 10*d, add 10\n- else if remainder >= d*10, add (remainder - 10*d +1)\n- else add 0\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to compute for each digit d in tens place:\n\nnumber of times = (N // 100) * 10\nremainder = N % 100\nif remainder >= 10*d, add 10\nelse if remainder >= d*10, add (remainder - 10*d +1)\nelse add 0\n\nWait, let me test this with d=4.\n\nFor tens digit 4:\n- N=488\n- complete cycles =488//100=4\n- remainder=88\n- since 88 >= 40 (10*4), so add 10\n- total=4*10 +10=50\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n- complete cycles=4\n- remainder=88\n- since 88 >=80 (10*8), add 10\n- but wait, 80 <=88, so add 10? Wait, but 88 is less than 90, so the tens digit can only go up to 8 (since 88 is 8 in tens place). So, for d=8, in the tens place, how many times does it appear?\n\nWait, in the tens place, for the remainder 88, the tens digit can go up to 8. So, the number of times 8 appears in the tens place in the remainder is 9 (from 80-88, which is 9 numbers). So, the formula should be:\n\nnumber of times = (N // 100) * 10\nremainder = N % 100\nif remainder >= 10*d:\n    add 10\nelif remainder >= d*10:\n    add (remainder - d*10 +1)\nelse:\n    add 0\n\nWait, let me test this for d=8:\n\nnumber of times =4*10=40\nremainder=88\nsince 88 >=80, add 10\ntotal=40+10=50? But that's not correct because in the remainder 88, the tens digit 8 appears only 9 times (80-88). So, perhaps the formula isn't accurate for d=8. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust it.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that for the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in each 100 numbers. So, for N=488, which is 4 full hundreds and 88 extra.\n\nIn the full hundreds (1-400), each digit 0-9 appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 4-8-8). So, for each digit d in 0-8, how many times does it appear in the tens place?\n\nFor d=0: 401-410, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\nd=1:411-420, 10 times.\n...\nd=8:481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, for d=4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\nFor d=8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, in the extra 88 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50\nTotal for 8's in tens place:40 +9=49\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place, as before, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99 +89=188\n8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe 90 was the answer, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me confirm: from page 400 to 488, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages, so 89 times. So, correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again: units place 4's:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps and the calculations seem accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - 488 pages have 48 full sets of 10 pages, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n   - Total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 488 pages have 4 full sets of 100 pages, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - The digit 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds places. Let me start by considering each position one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. So, that gives 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. But wait, does 488 include 488? Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the 48th group ends at 480, and then from 481 to 488, there's another 8 numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 times, and then in the last partial group from 481-488, does the units digit 4 appear again? 484 is within this range, so yes, that's another occurrence. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when I take 488 divided by 10, it's 48 full groups (each contributing one 4 in the units place) and then in the 49th group, which is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, in that last group, the units digit 4 occurs once at 484. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but actually, when counting from 1 to 488, the number of times the units digit is 4 is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the incomplete decade. The number of complete decades is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the incomplete decade (481-488), the units digit 4 occurs once at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, the first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, the next block is 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So, how many such blocks are there?\n\nLet me calculate: The first block is 40-49 (40 to 49), the next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. Then 140-149 is another 10, so 20 total so far. 240-249: 30, 340-349: 40, 440-449: 50. So yes, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nAgain, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the incomplete group from 481-488, the units digit 8 occurs once at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, how many complete blocks are there?\n\nThe first block is 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. Then 180-189: another 10, so 20 total. 280-289: 30, 380-389: 40, and then 480-488: 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks are complete, each contributing 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9 8's.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89: 10 8's in the tens place. 180-189: another 10, so 20. 280-289: 30. 380-389: 40. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 4 complete blocks (each contributing 10) and one incomplete block contributing 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check the tens place again. I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me recount the tens place 8's.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n\n- 180-189: another 10, so 20.\n\n- 280-289: another 10, so 30.\n\n- 380-389: another 10, so 40.\n\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (480 to 488), so 9 8's.\n\nSo, that's 4 complete blocks (each 10) and one partial block with 9. So, 4\u00d710 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, total tens place 8's: 49.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, now, total 4's were 188, and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then 481-488 includes 484, so one more, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing one 4, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then 481-488 includes 488, so one more, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can use a formula or another method to verify.\n\nAnother approach is to consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if the units digit of N is >= d else 0). But wait, actually, it's a bit more precise. The formula is:\n\nFor units digit: count = (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0). But only if d != 0, because 0 appears differently.\n\nWait, but in our case, d is 4 and 8, so non-zero.\n\nSo, for units digit 4:\n\ncount = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >= 4 else 0) = 48 + (1 if 8 >=4 else 0) = 48 +1 =49. Which matches our earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8:\n\ncount = (488 //10) + (1 if (488 %10) >=8 else 0) =48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nThe formula is a bit more involved. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N is:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10 + min(max(N % 100 - d*10 +1, 0), 10)\n\nWait, let me see. Alternatively, for the tens digit, each complete hundred contributes 10 times the digit in the tens place. So, for digit 4 in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 488 // 100 =4.\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 times the digit in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds \u00d710=40.\n\nThen, for the remaining part, which is 88 (since 488 = 4*100 +88), the tens digit can be 4. So, how many numbers from 400 to 488 have tens digit 4? That would be from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 10 numbers (440-449). So, adding 10.\n\nWait, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's: 4\u00d710 +10=50, which matches our earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:488//100=4.\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 times the digit in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40.\n\nThen, the remaining part is 88, so the tens digit can be 8 in the range 480-488. So, how many numbers have tens digit 8? From 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, adding 9.\n\nThus, total tens digit 8's:4\u00d710 +9=49, which matches our earlier count.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nDigit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nDigit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 to 899, but since our N is 488, which is less than 800, so 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm missing anything. For example, in the hundreds place, does 400-488 include 89 numbers? Let's see: 488 -400 +1=89. Yes, correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book ends at 488, it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nI think my counts are accurate.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** For every 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place. There are 48 full decades (1-480) contributing 48 '4's, and one more in 484, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 '4's, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '4' appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 '4's.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full decades contributing 48 '8's, and one more in 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks contributing 40 '8's, and 9 more in 480-488, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '8' does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's and 8's in the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once every 10 numbers. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each complete block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, the units place contributes equally to both 4 and 8, so no difference there.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. Now, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). In each of these 4 blocks, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per block, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, the extra 88 pages: 401-488. The tens digit here cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears once in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488) because 488 is the last page. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the extra 88 pages. So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from blocks) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Tens place 8's: 40 (from blocks) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times, so 4's have 1 more than 8's here.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards. Each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place for 100 pages each. For example, 100-199 have 1 in the hundreds place, 200-299 have 2, and so on. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times. So, hundreds place contributes 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm correct here. So, the hundreds digit for 400-488 is 4, and that's 89 pages because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times. And since there's no page 800-899, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units digit. There are 48 full blocks, so 48 each, and then in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so one 4 and one 8. So, 48 +1 = 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each block of 100 has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens digit. 4 blocks, so 40 each. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, 440-449 is 10 pages with tens digit 4, and 480-488 is 9 pages with tens digit 8. So, 40 +10 =50 for 4's, and 40 +9=49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages with hundreds digit 4. 8's: 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I was calculating the units place, I considered the last 8 pages as 481-488, which is correct. So, units digits from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, the last partial block is 401-488. The tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times 4. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 +50 +89=188\n8's:49 +49 +0=98\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 90, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let me think about each digit place separately and make sure I counted correctly.\n\nUnits digit:\n- From 1 to 488, how many 4's and 8's in units place.\n- Every 10 numbers, one 4 and one 8. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each.\n- Then, the last 8 numbers: 481-488. Units digits are 1-8, so one 4 and one 8. So, total units 4's:48 +1=49, units 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nTens digit:\n- Every 100 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times per 100.\n- 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, 8 units.\n- So, 4 hundreds mean 4 complete sets of 100, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 each.\n- Now, the last partial hundred: 401-488. The tens digits go from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488).\n- So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 more 4's.\n- The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 more 8's.\n- So, total tens 4's:40 +10=50\n- Total tens 8's:40 +9=49\n\nHundreds digit:\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages. So, 89 4's.\n- 800-899 would be hundreds digit 8, but since the book ends at 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n- 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n- Difference:188-98=90\n\nWait, so that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I can't spot any errors in my reasoning now. So, I'm confident the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n   - Last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 488 / 100 = 4.88 \u2192 4 full blocks, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - Last 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 440-449: 10 pages with tens digit 4.\n     - 480-488: 9 pages with tens digit 8.\n   - Total 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488: 89 pages with hundreds digit 4.\n   - No pages with hundreds digit 8.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let's start by counting the number of 4's first.\n\nFor single-digit page numbers (1-9), the digit 4 appears once, on page 4. So that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, for two-digit page numbers (10-99), I need to consider the tens place and the units place separately. \n\nIn the tens place, the digit 4 can appear in the 40-49 range. That's 10 pages (40 to 49), so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place, the digit 4 appears every 10 pages, so in each set of 10 (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), it appears once. There are 9 sets of 10 in two-digit numbers (10-99), but wait, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, so 9 sets of 10. But in each set, the units digit cycles from 0-9, so in each set, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So that's 9 occurrences for the units place. Wait, but from 10-99, it's 90 numbers, so 9 sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 times. So total in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 10-99, the tens digits go from 1 to 9. So for the tens place, when the tens digit is 4, that's 10 numbers: 40-49, so 10 times. For the units place, in each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit 4 appears once. Since there are 9 ten's groups (1-9), that's 9 times. So yes, 10 + 9 = 19 times in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. So, the three-digit numbers can be broken down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, for the hundreds digit being 4, the numbers are from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but hold on. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488. So, that's correct, 89 times.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 100 to 488. Let's think about this. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the hundreds place, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, except for the last hundred, which is only up to 488.\n\nWait, so let's break it down:\n\n- 100-199: The tens digit 4 appears in 140-149, which is 10 times.\n- 200-299: Similarly, 240-249, 10 times.\n- 300-399: 340-349, 10 times.\n- 400-488: Here, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, but since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so that's 10 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is beyond 449, so 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, in total, the tens digit 4 appears 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times. So, total 40 times.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0-9, so the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. Let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 100 to 488.\n\nFirst, let's consider each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: The units digit 4 appears in 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 times.\n- 200-299: Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294: 10 times.\n- 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394: 10 times.\n- 400-488: Now, from 400 to 488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? Well, from 400 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten's group. So, in 400-409: 404, 410-419: 414, 420-429: 424, 430-439: 434, 440-449: 444, 450-459: 454, 460-469: 464, 470-479: 474, 480-488: 484. Wait, but 484 is within 480-488, so that's one occurrence. So, how many times? Let's see: each ten's group contributes one 4 in the units place, and there are 9 ten's groups from 400-488 (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). So, 9 times? Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the units digit 4 would be in 484, so that's one occurrence. So, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times? Wait, no, that's not correct. Because from 400-488, how many complete ten's groups are there? Let's see: 400-409 (10 numbers), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), 450-459 (10), 460-469 (10), 470-479 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). So, in each of the first 8 ten's groups (400-409 to 470-479), the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 8 times. Then, in 480-488, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total in 400-488, it's 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred contributes 10 times, but in the last hundred, it's only 9 times. So, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers would be:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\n\nSo, total units digit 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, and 484. That's 9 times, as each ten's group contributes one, and there are 9 ten's groups up to 488. So yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the units place, 39 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\n\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. Hmm, that seems high. Let me make sure I didn't overcount.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit 4, so that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in each, except maybe the last one. Wait, earlier I thought it was 10 times in each, but from 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40 times. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each contributes 10, so 30, and from 400-488, it's 9, so total 39. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again: 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9), the digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers (10-99):\n\nIn the tens place, the digit 8 appears in the 80-89 range, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nIn the units place, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so in each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), it appears once. There are 9 ten's groups, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place from 100 to 488.\n\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in the range x80-x89, where x is the hundreds digit.\n\nSo:\n\n- 100-199: 180-189, which is 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: Here, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive).\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\n\nTotal in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nNow, units place in three-digit numbers:\n\nFor each hundred, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. Let's count:\n\n- 100-199: 108, 118, ..., 198. That's 10 times.\n- 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298: 10 times.\n- 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398: 10 times.\n- 400-488: Now, from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 8 appear? Each ten's group contributes one 8 in the units place. Let's see:\n\nFrom 400-409: 408\n410-419: 418\n420-429: 428\n430-439: 438\n440-449: 448\n450-459: 458\n460-469: 468\n470-479: 478\n480-488: 488\n\nSo, that's 9 times, as each ten's group from 400-488 contributes one 8 in the units place, except that 480-488 includes 488, so that's 9 times.\n\nSo, units digit 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\n\nTotal units digit 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, in 400-488, the units digit 8 appears at 408, 418, ..., 488. Let me count: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 39 times in total for units digit.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. So, 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because 90 seems a big difference, and I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me go back and verify each step.\n\nFirst, counting 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (correct).\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times (correct).\n- Units place: In each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the units digit 4 appears once, so 9 times (since there are 9 ten's groups from 10-99). So, 10 + 9 = 19 (correct).\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit 4, so 89 times (correct).\n\nTens place:\n\n- For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers, so 10 times per hundred. However, in 400-488, 440-449 is within the range, so 10 times. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40 times (correct).\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 times each, so 30.\n- 400-488: units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484: 9 times.\n- Total units digit 4's: 30 + 9 = 39 (correct).\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 89 + 40 + 39 = Wait, no. Wait, I think I might have miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, no, in the three-digit numbers, I broke it down into hundreds, tens, and units. So, hundreds:89, tens:40, units:39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Then, adding single-digit and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20, so total 4's: 20 + 168 = 188 (correct).\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (correct).\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place:80-89:10 times (correct).\n- Units place: In each ten's group, once, so 9 times (correct).\n- Total two-digit 8's:10 +9=19 (correct).\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place:0 (correct).\n\nTens place:\n\n- For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 10 +10 +10 +9=39 (correct).\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 times each, so 30.\n- 400-488: units digit 8 appears in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488:9 times.\n- Total units digit 8's:30 +9=39 (correct).\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers:39 (tens) +39 (units)=78.\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit:1 +19=20, so total 8's:20 +78=98 (correct).\n\nSo, difference:188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nWait, but I thought maybe I made a mistake because 90 seems a large number, but upon checking, all the counts seem correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I overcounted in the three-digit numbers. Let me recount the three-digit 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:400-488:89 (correct).\n- Tens place:140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: each 10, so 4*10=40 (correct).\n- Units place:104,114,...,194:10; 204,...,294:10; 304,...,394:10; 404,...,484:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39 (correct).\nTotal:89+40+39=168 (correct).\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:0 (correct).\n- Tens place:180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488:10+10+10+9=39 (correct).\n- Units place:108,...,198:10; 208,...,298:10; 308,...,398:10; 408,...,488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39 (correct).\nTotal:39+39=78 (correct).\n\nSo, yes, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Maybe I missed something in the three-digit units place for 4's. From 400-488, units digit 4 appears at 404,414,...,484. How many is that? Let's count:\n\n404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 9 in units place for 4's in 400-488.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place in 400-488, it's 408,418,...,488:9 numbers. So, correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the counts, and they seem accurate. So, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more '4's are printed than '8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** The digit '4' appears once (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - **Tens place:** Pages 40-49 contribute 10 occurrences.\n     - **Units place:** In each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), '4' appears once, totaling 9 times.\n     - **Total for two-digit pages:** 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences.\n     - **Tens place:** '4' appears in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 40.\n     - **Units place:** '4' appears 10 times in each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39.\n     - **Total for three-digit pages:** 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** The digit '8' appears once (page 8).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - **Tens place:** Pages 80-89 contribute 10 occurrences.\n     - **Units place:** In each ten's group, '8' appears once, totaling 9 times.\n     - **Total for two-digit pages:** 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - **Hundreds place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n     - **Tens place:** '8' appears in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, contributing 10, 10, 10, and 9 occurrences, totaling 39.\n     - **Units place:** '8' appears 10 times in each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39.\n     - **Total for three-digit pages:** 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me start by counting the number of 4's first.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: These are from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4. So, single-digit: 1 four.\n\nNow, moving on to two-digit page numbers: These range from 10 to 99. I think I should consider the tens place and the units place separately. \n\nIn the tens place, the digit 4 can appear in the numbers 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place. \n\nIn the units place, the digit 4 can appear in every set of ten, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 44 has two 4's, so actually, each of these contributes one 4 in the units place. So, from 10-99, in the units place, 4 appears 9 times. Wait, no, actually, from 10-99, for each ten, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so for each ten, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 tens (10-99 is 9 tens), so 9 fours in the units place. But wait, 44 is in the 40-49 range, which we've already counted in the tens place. So, for the units place, from 10-99, it's 9 fours. So total for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 fours.\n\nWait, but 44 has two 4's, so maybe I should count that as two. So, in the tens place, 40-49 gives 10 fours, and in the units place, 14,24,...,94 gives 9 fours, but 44 is included in both, so total fours in two-digit numbers would be 10 + 9 = 19, but 44 is counted twice, so maybe that's correct because it has two 4's. So, 19 fours in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: These are from 100 to 488. So, let's break this down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place: In three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 4. So, for each hundred, like 100-199, 200-299, etc., the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). Now, since our book goes up to 488, let's see how many hundreds we have.\n\nFrom 100-399: There are three hundreds here (100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each of these will have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 fours in the tens place.\n\nThen, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so another 10 fours. So, total fours in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the units place: In three-digit numbers, the units digit can be 4. For each hundred, like 100-199, the units digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten. So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the units digit is 4 (e.g., 104,114,...,194). There are three full hundreds (100-399), so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 fours in the units place.\n\nIn the 400-488 range, the units digit is 4 for numbers like 404,414,...,484. Let's see how many that is. From 400 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is within 488, but 494 would be 494, which is beyond 488. Wait, no, 484 is the last one. So, that's 9 fours in the units place for 400-488. So, total units place fours in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 fours.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 occur? Let's list them: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 fours. So, yes, 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) = 89 + 40 = 129; 129 + 39 = 168\n\nWait, that can't be right because 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168? Wait, 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is indeed 168. So total fours: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the three-digit numbers.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTens place: 3 hundreds (100-399) \u00d7 10 = 30, plus 10 in 400-488, so 40.\n\nUnits place: 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30, plus 9 in 400-488, so 39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 fours in three-digit numbers.\n\nThen, two-digit: 19, single-digit: 1. So total fours: 168 + 19 + 1 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting again with single-digit: 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: Let's break it down.\n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: For each ten, like 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the units place.\n\nBut wait, 88 has two 8's, so in the units place, we're counting each occurrence, so 9 eights in the units place, plus the 10 in the tens place. So total two-digit eights: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nWait, but 88 is included in both, so we're correctly counting both 8's in 88, right? Because in the tens place, 80-89 includes 88, which is one 8, and in the units place, 88 is also counted as one 8. So, 88 contributes two 8's, so total eights in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19, which correctly counts both 8's in 88.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but our book goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights.\n\nTens place: In three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 8. So, for each hundred, like 100-199, 200-299, etc., the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 180-189, 280-289, etc. Now, let's see how many full hundreds we have.\n\nFrom 100-399: There are three hundreds here. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30.\n\nIn 400-488: The tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nUnits place: In three-digit numbers, the units digit is 8. For each hundred, like 100-199, the units digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten. So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the units digit is 8: 108,118,...,198. There are three full hundreds (100-399), so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30.\n\nIn 400-488, the units digit is 8 for 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the units place.\n\nSo, total units place eights in three-digit numbers: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the eights:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: tens (39) + units (39) = 78\n\nWait, no, let me clarify: three-digit eights are tens (39) and units (39), so 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nSo, total eights: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me double-check.\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30, plus 9 in 400-488, so 39.\n\nUnits place: 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30, plus 9 in 400-488, so 39.\n\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78 eights in three-digit numbers.\n\nTwo-digit: 19, single-digit: 1. So total eights: 78 + 19 + 1 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me confirm my calculations again.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) = 89 + 40 = 129; 129 + 39 = 168\n\nTotal fours: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: tens (39) + units (39) = 78\n\nTotal eights: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me start by counting the number of 4's first.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10-99. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place: The numbers are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 44 has two 4's. So, in the units place, each of these numbers contributes one 4 except for 44, which contributes two. But wait, no, when considering the units place, each occurrence is just one per number, regardless of other digits. So, from 10-99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 such groups (10-99), so that's 9 times. But wait, 40-49 is a separate group where 4 is in the tens place. So, actually, the units digit 4 occurs 9 times in 10-99. Wait, no, 10-99 has 90 numbers, so 9 groups of 10. Each group has one 4 in the units place, so 9 times. But in the tens place, 40-49 has 10 times. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but 44 is in both, so does that mean I'm double-counting the 4 in 44? Let me check. When I count the tens place, 40-49 includes 44, which has a 4 in the tens place. When I count the units place, 44 is in the 40-49 group, but I'm counting the units digit 4's across all groups, so 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, etc. So, 44's units digit is counted once, and its tens digit is counted once. So, the total number of 4's is correctly 19 without double-counting. So, 10 in the tens place and 9 in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places to consider: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. But since 400-488 is not a full hundred, I need to handle that separately.\n\nFirst, for hundreds 100-399: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. For example, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399. So, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 3*10=30 times.\n\nNow, for the 400-488 range: The tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The digit 4 in the tens place would occur in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, contributing 10 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40 times.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similar to the tens place, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. For each hundred, the units digit 4 occurs once every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, it's 10 times per hundred. Let's break it down:\n\nFor 100-199: The units digit 4 occurs in 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 200-299: 204, 214, ..., 294. 10 times.\n\nFor 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394. 10 times.\n\nFor 400-488: The units digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so only up to 484. Let's count: starting at 404, each 10 numbers, so 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the ninth occurrence (since 404 is the first). Wait, no, 404 is the first, then each 10 numbers adds one more. From 404 to 484 is 80 numbers, which is 8 intervals of 10, so 9 numbers in total (including both ends). So, that's 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when I counted the hundreds place, I said 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place in three-digit numbers: 100-399: 3 hundreds, each with 10 4's in the tens place, so 30. Then 400-488: tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 30 + 10 = 40. That seems correct.\n\nFor the units place: 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. That seems correct.\n\nSo total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nNow, adding the single-digit and two-digit numbers: single-digit had 1, two-digit had 19, so 1 + 19 = 20. So total 4's: 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 168 seems high for three-digit numbers. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit numbers. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 100-399: each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place, so 3*10=30. Correct.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 30+10=40. Correct.\n\nIn the units place, for 100-399: each hundred has 10 numbers ending with 4, so 3*10=30. Then, in 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, as 484 is the last one before 488. So, 30 + 9 = 39. So, total units digit 4's:39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168. That seems correct.\n\nNow, single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:168. Total 4's: 1+19=20; 20+168=188.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check another way. Alternatively, I can calculate the total number of digits and see if 188 is reasonable. But maybe it's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers:10-99.\n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times 8 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: For each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit 8 appears once. There are 9 such groups (10-99), so 9 times. But wait, 80-89 is a group where 8 is in the tens place, so in the units place, 80-89 would have 88 as the units digit 8, but since we've already counted the tens place, the units digit 8's in 80-89 would be 88, which is one occurrence. So, for units digit 8's: 10-79: 7 groups (10-19, 20-29, ..., 70-79), each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 7. Then, 80-89: as above, one more in 88. Then, 90-99: 98, which is another one. So, total units digit 8's:7 (from 10-79) +1 (88) +1 (98) =9.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because from 10-99, the units digit 8 occurs once in each ten's group, except that in 80-89, it's 88, which is one occurrence. So, actually, from 10-99, the units digit 8 occurs 9 times: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: tens place 10 + units place 9 =19.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers:100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 appears in the hundreds place only in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit 8 never occurs. So, 0 times.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nWait, 480-488 is part of 400-488, so let's count each:\n\n100-199: 180-189:10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\n200-299:280-289:10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\n300-399:380-389:10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\n400-488:480-488:9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred, the units digit 8 occurs once every 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199: 108,118,128,...,198. That's 10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299:208,218,...,298:10.\n\n300-399:308,318,...,398:10.\n\n400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 408 to 488 with step 10 is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, units digit 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 =78.\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 78. So, total 8's:1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 8's in three-digit numbers would be similar to 4's, but maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, hundreds place: 0 times, correct.\n\nTens place:100-199:180-189:10.\n\n200-299:280-289:10.\n\n300-399:380-389:10.\n\n400-488:480-488:9.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place:100-199:108,118,...,198:10.\n\n200-299:208,...,298:10.\n\n300-399:308,...,398:10.\n\n400-488:408,418,...,488:9.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nThus, total 8's in three-digit numbers:39+39=78.\n\nAdding single-digit 1 and two-digit 19:1+19=20, so total 8's:20+78=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 =90.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I might have overcounted in some places. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when I counted 4's in three-digit numbers, I had 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168.\n\nThen, single-digit 1 and two-digit 19: total 4's=188.\n\nFor 8's: hundreds=0, tens=39, units=39, plus single-digit 1 and two-digit 19: total 8's=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit units place for 4's. Earlier, I thought 400-488 has 9 units digit 4's, but let me recount.\n\nFrom 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in 400-488, units digit 8 occurs at 408,418,...,488. That's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 4's in three-digit numbers, I had 40 times. Let me check that again.\n\nFor 100-399: each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 3*10=30.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 30+10=40. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place in three-digit numbers:100-399: each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 3*10=30.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 30+9=39. Correct.\n\nSo, the counts seem accurate.\n\nTherefore, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the two-digit numbers. Let me check again.\n\nIn two-digit numbers, for 4's: tens place 10 (40-49), units place 9 (14,24,...,94). So, 19.\n\nFor 8's: tens place 10 (80-89), units place 9 (18,28,...,98). So, 19.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSo, single-digit:1 for both.\n\nTwo-digit:19 for both.\n\nThree-digit:4's=168, 8's=78.\n\nSo, total 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference, but considering the range up to 488, maybe it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as counting the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet's try this.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nIn the units place, each digit 0-9 appears equally often, except possibly the last digit if the total isn't a multiple of 10.\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:48 (since 48*10=480). So, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nBut wait, 488 is the last number, so units digits go up to 8. So, the units digit 4 appears 48 times (from 1-480), plus one more if 484 is within the range. Wait, 484 is less than 488, so units digit 4 appears 48 times (from 1-480) plus one more at 484, so total 49 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because from 1-488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480), and then 481-488. So, in the units place, digits 1-8 appear once more. So, units digit 4 appears 48 times plus one more at 484, so 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 appears 48 times plus one more at 488, so 49 times.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier count where units digit 4's in three-digit numbers were 39. Hmm, maybe this method is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the approach. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the units place, for all numbers from 1-488, each digit 0-9 appears how many times?\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nNumber of complete decades (groups of 10):48 (since 48*10=480). Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nThen, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, each appearing once.\n\nSo, total units digit counts:\n\nFor digits 0:48 times.\n\nFor digits 1-9:48 times each, plus one more for digits 1-8 (since 481-488). So, digits 1-8 appear 49 times, and digit 9 appears 48 times.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 481-488 is 8 numbers, so digits 1-8 each appear once more. So, units digits:\n\n0:48\n\n1:48+1=49\n\n2:48+1=49\n\n...\n\n8:48+1=49\n\n9:48\n\nSo, units digit 4 appears 49 times, units digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the tens place (from 1-480). Then, in 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers, so digit 8 appears 8 more times in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens digit counts:\n\nFor each digit 0-9:48 times.\n\nDigit 8:48 +8=56 times.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place:\n\nDigits 1,2,3,4 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nDigit 1:100-199:100 times.\n\nDigit 2:200-299:100 times.\n\nDigit 3:300-399:100 times.\n\nDigit 4:400-488:89 times (since 488-400+1=89).\n\nDigits 0:0 times in hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds digit counts:\n\n1:100\n\n2:100\n\n3:100\n\n4:89\n\n0:0\n\nNow, let's calculate total 4's and 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:48 (since digit 4 appears 48 times in tens place, as per above, because only 400-488 affects it, but wait, no, in the tens place, digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc. Wait, perhaps my earlier approach is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I should stick to the initial method where I counted each position separately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to use the digit-by-digit counting.\n\nBut I think I'm confusing myself now. Let me try to reconcile both methods.\n\nIn the initial approach, I counted:\n\n4's:188\n\n8's:98\n\nDifference:90.\n\nBut using the units, tens, hundreds approach:\n\nUnits digit 4:49\n\nTens digit 4: in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nIn the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the tens place, except for the last partial group.\n\nWait, from 1-488, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nEach full hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 1-488:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4 (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488).\n\nWait, no, the tens place cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-488, the tens digit cycles 4 full times (each 100 numbers) plus 88 numbers into the fifth hundred, but 400-488 is part of the fourth hundred.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe it's better to stick with the initial count where I got 188 4's and 98 8's, difference 90.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial count. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nAs each group of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. There are 48 full groups of 10 (1-480), so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so no additional 4's. So, total 48 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 49 times because 484 is included. Wait, no, 484 is within 1-488, so in the units place, 484 is the 48th occurrence of 4 in the units place? Wait, no, because 484 is the 484th number, which is within the 48 full groups of 10 (1-480), so 484 is in 480-489, which is the 48th group. So, 484 is the 4th number in that group, so units digit 4 occurs once in that group. So, total units digit 4's:48.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8's:48 times, plus one more at 488, so 49 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is the 488th number, which is in the 48th group (480-489). So, units digit 8 occurs at 488, which is the 9th number in that group (480 is the 1st). So, units digit 8 occurs once in each group, so 48 times, plus one more at 488? Wait, no, because 488 is in the 48th group, which is 480-489, so units digit 8 occurs at 488, which is the 9th number in that group. So, units digit 8 occurs once per group, so 48 times, plus one more at 488, making it 49 times.\n\nWait, but 480-489 is the 48th group, so units digit 8 occurs at 488, which is the 9th number in that group, so that's one occurrence. So, total units digit 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 4's:48 times, because 484 is in the 48th group, which is 480-489, and units digit 4 occurs at 484, which is the 5th number in that group, so that's one occurrence. So, total units digit 4's:48.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought where I thought units digit 4's were 49. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that from 1-480, each units digit 0-9 appears exactly 48 times. Then, from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, each appearing once. So, units digit 4 appears 48 times (from 1-480) plus one more at 484, making it 49 times. Similarly, units digit 8 appears 48 times plus one more at 488, making it 49 times.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, units digit 4's:49, units digit 8's:49.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears equally in the tens place, except possibly the last partial group.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nEach full hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place (e.g., 00-09, 10-19, etc.). So, for each hundred, 10 times per digit.\n\nThere are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, ..., 401-500?), wait, no, 488 is less than 500.\n\nWait, actually, from 1-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 1-99: 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place (0-9).\n\n- 100-199: same, 10 each.\n\n- 200-299: same.\n\n- 300-399: same.\n\n- 400-488: the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last number), so each digit 0-8 appears 9 times (from 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 /10 = 8 full groups, but that's not exact. Wait, perhaps better to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place from 400-488.\n\nWait, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 9 times (since 488 is the 89th number in 400-488, which is 89 = 9*10 -1, so each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 9 times except for 8, which appears 9 times as well because 480-488 is 9 numbers).\n\nWait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers. The tens digit cycles 0-8, each appearing 9 times: 0 appears in 400-409 (10 numbers), 10 in 410-419, etc., up to 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, each tens digit from 0-8 appears 9 times in 400-488.\n\nSo, total tens digit counts:\n\nFrom 1-399: each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place (since 1-399 includes 4 hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributing 10 times per digit).\n\nWait, no, 1-99: tens digits 0-9 each appear 10 times (1-9: tens digit 0, 10-19:1, etc.), so 10 times each.\n\nSimilarly, 100-199: tens digits 0-9 each appear 10 times.\n\n200-299: same.\n\n300-399: same.\n\nSo, from 1-399, each tens digit appears 4*10=40 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: each tens digit 0-8 appears 9 times, as above.\n\nSo, total tens digit counts:\n\nFor digits 0-8:\n\n40 (from 1-399) +9 (from 400-488) =49 times.\n\nFor digit 9:\n\n40 times (from 1-399) +0 (since 400-488 doesn't reach 490) =40 times.\n\nSo, tens digit 4 appears 49 times, and tens digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total tens digit 8's:40 (from 1-399) +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 4's:40 +9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no counts.\n\n100-199: hundreds digit 1:100 times.\n\n200-299: hundreds digit 2:100 times.\n\n300-399: hundreds digit 3:100 times.\n\n400-488: hundreds digit 4:89 times.\n\nSo, hundreds digit 4:89 times.\n\nHundreds digit 8:0 times, since the book only goes up to 488.\n\nSo, total hundreds digit counts:\n\n4:89\n\n8:0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+49+89=187.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 188. Hmm, discrepancy here.\n\nWait, let's recount.\n\nUnits digit 4's:49\n\nTens digit 4's:49\n\nHundreds digit 4's:89\n\nTotal:49+49=98; 98+89=187.\n\nHmm, but earlier I thought it was 188.

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let's start with the units place because that's the simplest. \n\nStarting with the units digit: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. But I need to figure out how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages and then see if there's a partial block. \n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 more numbers. In each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, total units digit counts: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so in the units place, they're equal. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each block of 100, the digit in the tens place goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. For example, in 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 0-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488. \n\nIn each of the 4 complete blocks, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each block, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, looking at the partial block from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let me see: 401-410 has tens digit 0, 411-420 has 1, 421-430 has 2, 431-440 has 3, 441-450 has 4, 451-460 has 5, 461-470 has 6, 471-480 has 7, and 481-488 has 8. \n\nSo, in the tens place, in the partial block, how many times does 4 appear? It's from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. And 8 appears in the tens place from 481-488, but that's only 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. \n\nSo, total tens digit counts: 4 appears 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 8 = 48 times. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times. That's a difference of 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299 is 2; 300-399 is 3; 400-488 is 4. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, total hundreds digit counts: 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. \n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences. \n\nFor 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. \n\nFor 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 48, Hundreds place: 0. Total = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97. \n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) equals 91. \n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with units place: 48 full tens blocks, each contributing 1 for 4 and 1 for 8. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units: 48 +1=49 for both, correct. \n\nTens place: 4 complete hundreds blocks, each contributing 10 for 4 and 10 for 8. Then, in the partial block (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 8 times (480-488). So, 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +8=48 for 8. That's correct. \n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 appears 0 times. Correct. \n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188. \n\nTotal 8's: 49 +48 +0=97. \n\nDifference: 188-97=91. \n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages), contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - Four complete blocks (400 pages) contribute 40 each.\n   - The partial block (401-488) contributes 10 4's (440-449) and 8 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's.\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference**: 188 - 97 = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. But wait, in the first block, from 1 to 10, 4 appears in 4, and 8 appears in 8, so that's one each. But when we get to higher numbers, maybe the hundreds place comes into play. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to break it down by each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. So, for each position, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). So, in each of the 48 complete groups, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial group, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once in this group as well (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, same calculation: 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times, plus the last group, 481-488, where 8 appears once (488). So, 48 +1 = 49 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears when the tens digit is 4. So, for example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, etc.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nLet me see. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. So, that's another 10 numbers, so 10 more times. So, total 40 +10=50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 488 is 488, so from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 more. So, total 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, how many times does it appear?\n\nSame approach: in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each hundred, 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds would give 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. So, total 40 +9=49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 -49=1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears when the hundreds digit is 4. So, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8 in the hundreds place, we'd need to look at page numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 -0=89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's add up the differences from each digit position.\n\nUnits place: 49 vs 49, difference 0.\n\nTens place: 50 vs 49, difference +1.\n\nHundreds place: 89 vs 0, difference +89.\n\nSo, total difference is 0 +1 +89=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1 to 4 and 8 in units place. Then, in the last group (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. So, correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so total 50 for 4. For 8, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 4*10=40. In 401-488, tens digit 8 is from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40+9=49 for 8. So, 50-49=1. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place, so 0. So, difference of 89. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=90.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. From 400-488, inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAnother way to think about it: page numbers from 1-399: 399 pages. Then 400-488: 89 pages. So, in 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times. So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in hundreds place, since 800-899 would be needed, but the book only goes to 488, so no 8's in hundreds place.\n\nSo, the total difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm by another method. Maybe count the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** 48 full groups of 10 (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in 481-488 = 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** 4 full hundreds (4 \u00d7 10) + 10 in 440-449 = 50.\n   - **8's:** 4 full hundreds (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 in 480-488 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** 89 times (400-488).\n   - **8's:** 0 times.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe it's better to count the occurrences of each digit separately in each position: units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and an extra 8 pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 ends with a 4, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nAdding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets and 8 extra pages. So, units place 8's: 48. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is the last page, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. How many full hundreds are there? Four, as before. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears once every 100 pages, so 10 times per hundred. So, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), does the tens digit 8 appear? Yes, from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? Each number from 480-488 has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 times. Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (including both ends). So, 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 has a 4, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 is 10, so +10, total 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so +89.\nTotal 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full sets, +1 in 488, total 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, 480-488 is 9, so +9, total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages. So, in each full group, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so no 4 in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every group of 100 pages, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each 100 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. How many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. So, 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (from 400 to 488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, how many 4's are there? From 440 to 449, that's 10 times. So, adding that, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. So, the digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs from page 400 to 488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Again, every 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, as before, 48 full groups of 10, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For every 100 pages, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100 pages, 10 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nSo, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48, and then in 481-488, page 488 has an 8, so that's 1 more, totaling 49. Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, and in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 times, so 40 + 9 = 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. That seems right.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, how many more 4's than 8's? That would be 187 - 98. Let me compute that: 187 - 98. 187 - 100 is 87, but since I subtracted 2 more, I add 2 back, so 87 + 2 = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 times (from 4,14,24,...,484). Wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence. Then, 488 is beyond that, so no more 4's in units place after 484. So, 48 is correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's. So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, 488 has an 8, so 1 more, totaling 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 400 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8's again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 pages: 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence?\n\nThe first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, the 8's occur in 08,18,...,98 in each hundred, so 10 times per hundred. But in the last partial hundred, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, as 480 is included. So, 9 times. So, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo, yeah, 49 8's in units and 49 in tens, totaling 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each position one by one for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. Therefore, in the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, right? So, maybe the difference comes from the tens and hundreds places.\n\nWait, but let me check. The book has 488 pages, so the last page is 488. That means the hundreds place goes up to 4, and the tens and units go up to 88 in the last page. So, maybe the hundreds place only has 4's from 400 to 488. Hmm, that might affect the count.\n\nLet me structure this properly. I'll consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, for the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total number of 4's in units place is the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, how many complete tens are there? Let me think, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, in the 480th page, 480 ends with a 0, so the next page is 481, which ends with 1, and so on up to 488. So, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in 484. Therefore, total 4's in units place would be 48 (from each complete ten) plus 1 (from 484), totaling 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete tens, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial group, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. Therefore, total 8's in units place would be 48 (from complete tens) plus 1 (from 488), totaling 49.\n\nSo, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nFor the tens digit, the count is a bit different. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 10-19, the tens digit is 1; 20-29, it's 2, and so on. So, for each digit in the tens place, it appears 10 times per hundred.\n\nBut let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 1 to 488.\n\nFirst, from 1 to 99: the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, from 1-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit from 1-9 appears 10 times in the tens place from 1-99. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place from 40-49.\n\nSimilarly, from 100-199: the tens digit cycles again 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times in 140-149.\n\nFrom 200-299: same pattern, 4 appears 10 times in 240-249.\n\nFrom 300-399: 4 appears 10 times in 340-349.\n\nNow, from 400-488: the tens digit starts at 0 (400-409), then 1 (410-419), up to 8 (480-488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409 (10 numbers), 1 for 410-419 (10 numbers), ..., up to 8 for 480-488. But 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, from 400-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449).\n\nSo, total number of 4's in the tens place is from 40-49 (10 times), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1-99, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Then 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly for 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. Then 400-488: 440-449, 10. So, that's 50 times total.\n\nNow, for 8's in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, 10 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, 10 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, 10 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8, but only 9 times, because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 480-488.\n\nSo, total number of 8's in the tens place is 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, digits can be 1,2,3,4 since the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199 (100 numbers), 2 for 200-299 (100), 3 for 300-399 (100), and 4 for 400-488 (89 numbers, since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 times.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, in the hundreds place, the digits go up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear at all in the hundreds place. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, the difference in the hundreds place is 89 (for 4) - 0 (for 8) = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the differences from each digit place.\n\nUnits place: 49 (4's) - 49 (8's) = 0.\n\nTens place: 50 (4's) - 49 (8's) = +1.\n\nHundreds place: 89 (4's) - 0 (8's) = +89.\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 in all of them, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times, so difference +1.\n\nUnits place: both 49 times, so no difference.\n\nSo, total difference is 89 (hundreds) +1 (tens) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other digit positions. For example, in the hundreds place, is there any 8? No, because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 1-99, hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, it's 1, 200-299:2, 300-399:3, and 400-488:4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0 times for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50 +89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 +0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nBut let me think again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place.\n\nWait, when I was counting the 4's in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five groups of 10, so 50 times. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four groups are 10 each, and the last is 9, so 49 times. So, 50 vs 49, difference +1.\n\nUnits place: both 49 times, so no difference.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, total difference is 89 +1 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach to confirm.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nCalculating total 4's:\n\nUnits place: from 1-488, how many 4's? As before, 49.\n\nTens place: 50.\n\nHundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I just thought, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. But when I was counting the tens place, I included 440-449 as 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and in the tens place, 50 times, and units 49 times, so total 188. For 8's, only in units and tens, 49 each, so 98. So, 188 -98 =90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occur once every 10 pages. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, plus one more in 484. Total: 49.\n   - **8's:** Occur once every 10 pages. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, plus one more in 488. Total: 49.\n   - **Difference:** 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Appear in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each group contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **8's:** Appear in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four groups contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Difference:** 50 - 49 = +1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Appear in 400-488, contributing 89 times.\n   - **8's:** Do not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Difference:** 89 - 0 = +89.\n\nSumming the differences:\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Let me start by considering each position one by one for both 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position.\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 full sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's no 4 in the units place here. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the tens place. Specifically, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digits go up to 8. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 times. So total 4's in tens place: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me check again. From 1-100: 40-49, so 10 times. Similarly, 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, another 10. 301-400: 340-349, another 10. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers. So, hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. Units place: Again, in every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, how many full sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in the units place (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, in the first four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 times, correct. So, tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 187 and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times. That seems correct because from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each with one 4, so 48. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) don't include a 4 in the units place, so that's correct.\n\n- Tens place: 50 times. As I thought, in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40, and then in the 401-488 range, another 10 in 440-449, so 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times. 48 full sets (1-480) contributing one 8 each, so 48. Then, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so +1, total 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 49 times. In each hundred, 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 8's in the 401-488 range, is it exactly 9 numbers? 480-488 is 9 numbers, yes. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but when I count the units place, I have 488, which is included, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nI think my counts are accurate. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Let me start by counting the number of 4's first.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: These are from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence of 4.\n\nNow, moving on to two-digit page numbers: These range from 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place.\n\nIn the tens place: The numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place: The numbers would be 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to 99, that's 9 numbers, right? Wait, no, from 10-99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 10-99, that's 9 groups (10-19 to 90-99), each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 9 times. But wait, 44 is included here, so the units digit 4 appears 9 times, but the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). So, in two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n\nWait, but wait, when I'm counting units digits, from 10 to 99, how many times does 4 appear? Let me think again. For each ten's group, like 10-19, the units digits go from 0-9, so 4 appears once in each ten's group. There are 9 ten's groups (10-19 up to 90-99), so that's 9 times. But wait, when the ten's group is 40-49, the units digit 4 also appears in 44, but I think I've already counted that in the units place. So, yes, 9 times in the units place. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but hold on, when I'm in the 40-49 range, the units digit 4 appears once in 44, right? So, that's included in the 9 units digit counts. So, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: These are from 100 to 488. So, I need to consider hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's break it down by each digit place.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 only goes up to 488, not 499. So, for hundreds digit 4, the numbers are from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, tens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nLet me think. For each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred group, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). But for the 400-488 group, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, how many hundred groups are there? Let's see: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's four groups.\n\nIn each of the first three groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, so that's 3 * 10 = 30 times.\n\nIn the 400-488 group, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 times. So, total in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 400-488 group, does the tens digit go up to 8? Let me check: 400-488. The tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the 400-488 group, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, yes, 40 times total in the tens place.\n\nNow, units place: For three-digit numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred group, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIn each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred group, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nFrom 100-199: 104,114,124,...,194. That's 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10 times.\n\n300-399: 304,314,...,394: 10 times.\n\nNow, 400-488: The units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, but 484 is within 400-488, so that's 9 times, right? Because 404,414,...,484: from 404 to 484, that's 9 numbers, each 10 apart. Wait, 404 + 10*8 = 484, so that's 9 numbers. So, in 400-488, units digit 4 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but wait, let me confirm: For 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers starting from 404 up to 484. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the 9th one (since 404 is the first, then 414 is the second, up to 484 as the ninth). So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Because in each hundred group, the units digit 4 appears 10 times, except the last one, which is 9 times because the book ends at 488. So, 3 full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contribute 10 each, so 3*10=30. Then, 400-488 contributes 9, so total 39.\n\nWait, but hold on, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's: 39.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 4 appears:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 times\n- Units place: 39 times\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nUnits place: The units digit is 8 in numbers like 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers (since 88 is included in both tens and units, but we're counting units digit here). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no three-digit page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times.\n\nTens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges:\n\n- 100-199: 180-189\n- 200-299: 280-289\n- 300-399: 380-389\n- 400-488: 480-488\n\nWait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundred groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and 9 times in the 400-488 group.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 3 * 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nUnits place: The units digit is 8 in numbers ending with 8. So, in each hundred group, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nIn 100-199: 108,118,...,198. That's 10 times.\nIn 200-299: 208,218,...,298. 10 times.\nIn 300-399: 308,318,...,398. 10 times.\nIn 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times because 488 is included, so from 408 to 488, that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total units digit 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 8 appears:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39 times\n- Units place: 39 times\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the count of 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (correct)\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 (correct)\nThree-digit:\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in hundreds place.\n- Tens: 40 times (3 groups of 10 and one group of 10, but wait, earlier I thought it was 40, but let me check again. Wait, for tens place, in each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), 4 appears 10 times each, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, 440-449 is 10 times, so 30+10=40. Correct.\n- Units: 10 in each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 3*10=30. In 400-488, 404,414,...,484: that's 9 times. So, 30+9=39. Correct.\nSo, 89+40+39=168 in three-digit. Plus 19 in two-digit and 1 in single-digit: 168+19=187+1=188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (correct)\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19 (correct)\nThree-digit:\n- Tens place: 10 in each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 3*10=30. In 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 30+9=39.\n- Units place: 10 in each of the first three hundreds, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, 408,418,...,488: 9 numbers. So, 30+9=39.\nTotal three-digit 8's: 39+39=78. Correct.\nTotal 8's: 1+19+78=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the three-digit numbers for 4's and 8's?\n\nFor 4's in three-digit:\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n- Tens: 40 times.\n- Units: 39 times.\nTotal: 89+40+39=168.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit:\n\n- Tens: 39 times.\n- Units: 39 times.\nTotal: 78.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units digit count for 4 in three-digit numbers again. From 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 numbers ending with 4, so 3*10=30. Then, 400-488: 404,414,...,484. Let me count: 404 is the first, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 30+9=39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, same logic: 3*10=30, plus 9 in 400-488, total 39. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised it's that high. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by calculating the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units digit:\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nIn units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often, except possibly the last digit if it doesn't complete a full set.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 488 / 10 = 48 full sets, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nEach complete set contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, 48 sets * 1 = 48 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 numbers: 481-488.\n\nLooking at units digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSo, in the units place, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total units digit 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTotal units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated 39 units digit 4's in three-digit numbers, but this approach gives 49. There's a discrepancy here. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted in the three-digit numbers. Let me reconcile this.\n\nWait, according to this method, units digit 4's: 49, and units digit 8's: 49.\n\nBut in my earlier detailed count, I had:\n\n- Units digit 4's: 39\n- Units digit 8's: 39\n\nWait, that's a big difference. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I didn't account for the single-digit and two-digit numbers correctly in this alternative approach.\n\nWait, in the units digit approach:\n\n- From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers.\n\n- For units digit 4: each 10 numbers contributes one 4. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, with 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\n- In each full cycle, 4 appears once, so 48 times.\n\n- In the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\n- So, total units digit 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Similarly, units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nBut in my earlier detailed count, I had:\n\n- Units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 39\n- Units digit 4's in two-digit and single-digit: 1 (single-digit) + 9 (two-digit) = 10\n- So, total units digit 4's: 10 + 39 = 49. Which matches this approach.\n\nWait, so in my initial detailed count, I had 39 units digit 4's in three-digit numbers, plus 10 from single and two-digit, totaling 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8's: 1 (single-digit) +9 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit) = 49. Which matches the alternative approach.\n\nSo, that means my initial detailed count was correct, but when I summed up all 4's as 188, that included 49 units digit 4's, 40 tens digit 4's, and 89 hundreds digit 4's.\n\nWait, but in the alternative approach, I can also calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in tens and hundreds places.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nTens digit:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears in the tens place equally in blocks of 100. So, for each 100 numbers, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nTotal number of full hundreds in 488 pages: 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nWait, no, actually, 488 pages mean 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages from 401-488.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better way is to consider how many times each digit appears in the tens place across all page numbers.\n\nFor the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times for every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-400), and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSo, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times for 4's and 4*10=40 times for 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). Let's see:\n\nFrom 401-409: tens digit 0\n410-419: tens digit 1\n...\n480-488: tens digit 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It's in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear? It's in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 times.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages, tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 40 (from full hundreds) +10=50\nTotal tens digit 8's: 40 +9=49\n\nSo, that's 50 times 4 and 49 times 8 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 times (since 488-400+1=89).\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Zero, because the book only goes up to 488, so no pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds digit 4's: 89\nHundreds digit 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up all occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units digit: 49\n- Tens digit: 50\n- Hundreds digit: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units digit: 49\n- Tens digit: 49\n- Hundreds digit: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think this makes sense now. The alternative approach using digit positions and full cycles helped me catch any possible errors in the initial detailed counting. It's reassuring that both methods lead to the same result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** '4' appears once.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: '4' appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - Units place: '4' appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94).\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 times.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: '4' appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n     - Tens place: '4' appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and 10 times in 400-488 (440-449), totaling 40 times.\n     - Units place: '4' appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39 times.\n     - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** '8' appears once.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: '8' appears 10 times (80-89).\n     - Units place: '8' appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 times.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: '8' does not appear.\n     - Tens place: '8' appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488 (480-488), totaling 39 times.\n     - Units place: '8' appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39 times.\n     - Total: 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8' in the page numbers of the book.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let's start with the units place because that might be simpler.\n\nFor the units place, I can think about how often each digit from 0 to 9 appears. In every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each of these 48 blocks, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. That gives us 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. Now, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once (484), and the digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, so far, the count is equal for units place.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digits go from 0 ten times (0-9), then 1 ten times (10-19), and so on up to 9 ten times (90-99). So, in each 100-number block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. Now, how many complete 100-number blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers left (401-488). In each of these 4 blocks, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8 in the tens place. Now, looking at the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-488, where the tens digit is 8. So, in these 88 numbers, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, the tens digit is 4 when the page numbers are 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place when the numbers are 480-488, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Wait, 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. Therefore, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 40 (from the blocks) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times, and the digit 8 appears 40 (from the blocks) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is ahead by 1 here.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers from 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so we can ignore those. Now, in the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears 100 times. Wait, no, actually, for a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4. Let me clarify: from 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place? For 100-199: 100 times digit 1. 200-299: 100 times digit 2. 300-399: 100 times digit 3. 400-488: 89 times digit 4 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because the highest hundreds digit is 4. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 48 complete blocks of 10 (480 numbers) give 48 occurrences of each digit.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one 4 and one 8.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total 8's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 4 complete blocks of 100 (400 numbers) give 40 occurrences of each digit.\n   - Remaining 88 numbers (401-488) add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total 8's:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - Digit 8 does not appear.\n   - **Total 4's:** 89\n   - **Total 8's:** 0\n\n**Summing Up:**\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should count the occurrences of each digit separately in each position: units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\n1. Units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 pages. In each complete group, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial group from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is in there, which is another 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? Every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles and 8 extra numbers. Each full cycle contributes 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is there, adding 1 more. So, total 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens digit. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488. In each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). So, 4 full hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 times. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm. From 1-100, 40-49 is 10 times. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each contribute 10. So, 5 sets of 10, but wait, 488 is less than 500, so 440-449 is within 488, but 540-549 would be beyond. So, actually, in 488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? From 40-49: 10, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 50 times. Hmm, maybe I was right the first time. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial group from 481-488 has units digits 1-8, so 488 is there, which is another 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check. 488 is included, so the last number is 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so yes, that's 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens digit 8. It appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these contributes 10 times except maybe the last one. Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 180-189: 10 times.\n- 280-289: 10 times.\n- 380-389: 10 times.\n- 480-488: How many numbers here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm. From 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears in the following ranges:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, 10*4=40 +9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit 8 would appear in pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. Hmm, okay.\n\nWait, but when I counted 4's, I had 188, and 8's as 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:49\nHundreds place:0\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's:49, 8's:49.\n\nWait, so 4's have 89 in hundreds place, which 8's don't have. So, 89 extra 4's.\n\nBut wait, 4's total is 188, 8's is 98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the 8's in the tens place. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9.\n\nSo, 49 in tens place for 8's.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so 488 has 8 in the tens and units place. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate.\n\nThus, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the units place for 4's. From 1-488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in units. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial group is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's one more. So, 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, same logic: 48 full groups, 48, plus 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 4's have 49 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds. 49+50=99, +89=188.\n\n8's have 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. 49+49=98.\n\n188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups (48 occurrences) + 1 in the last partial group (484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100.\n   - In 488 pages, this happens in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each contributes 10, except 440-449, which is fully within 488.\n   - Total: 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total: 48 full groups + 1 in the last partial group (488).\n   - Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four contributes 10, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages in 488 have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each position one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once (at 4) and the digit 8 appears once (at 8). How many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). Wait, no, actually, the last block would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Let me see: from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place. For units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each block of 10. So, for 488 pages, how many complete decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete decades and an extra 8 numbers. In each complete decade, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. So, in 48 decades, that's 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial block, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, and 48 +1=49 eights. Hmm, so so far, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times per 100 numbers. Now, let's apply this to our problem. From 1-488, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place? First, let's find how many complete hundreds there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488. In each complete hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 complete hundreds, each digit appears 4*10=40 times. Now, for the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, no, actually, 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let's see: 401-410: tens digit is 0 (10 numbers), 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers), ..., up to 480-488: tens digit 8 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last). So, the tens digits from 0 to 8 appear in this partial hundred, but 8 only appears 9 times. So, for the tens digit in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for tens place: fours would be 4*10 (from complete hundreds) +10 (from partial hundred) = 50 fours. Eights would be 4*10 (from complete hundreds) +9 (from partial hundred) = 49 eights. So, in the tens place, fours appear 50 times, eights appear 49 times. So, fours are ahead by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 numbers. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (but since we're only considering page numbers starting at 1, maybe we can consider it as not appearing, but in reality, page numbers don't have leading zeros, so hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards). So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't appear. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place? Let's see: 100-199: 100 times digit 1. 200-299: 100 times digit 2. 300-399: 100 times digit 3. 400-488: 89 times digit 4 (since 488-400+1=89). Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? 89 times. How about 8? Since 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for hundreds place: fours =89, eights=0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each position.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal fours =49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal eights=49+49+0=98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more fours are printed than eights. So, subtract the total eights from total fours: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, units place: I had 48 complete decades, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight. Then, the last partial decade (481-488) has 8 numbers, with units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units fours:48+1=49, units eights:48+1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights. So, 4*10=40 fours, 40 eights. Then, the partial hundred from 401-488: tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). For tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. For tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens fours:40+10=50, tens eights:40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: fours appear from 400-488, which is 89 times, and eights don't appear at all. So, 89 fours, 0 eights. Correct.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188. Total eights:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the hundreds place count correct? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89 fours. For eights, since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 eights in hundreds place.\n\nHmm, seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each tens digit, how many times does it appear? From 401-410, tens digit 0 (10 numbers). 411-420, tens digit 1 (10). 421-430, tens digit 2 (10). 431-440, tens digit3 (10). 441-450, tens digit4 (10). 451-460, tens digit5 (10). 461-470, tens digit6 (10). 471-480, tens digit7 (10). 481-488, tens digit8 (8 numbers). Wait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So, in the partial hundred, tens digit 8 appears 9 times, and tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449). So, that part is correct.\n\nWait, but in the partial hundred from 401-488, which is 88 numbers (since 488-401+1=88), how does that break down? Let me see: 401-410:10, 411-420:10, 421-430:10, 431-440:10, 441-450:10, 451-460:10, 461-470:10, 471-480:10, 481-488:8. Wait, that adds up to 10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+8=88. So, yes, correct.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times. So, total tens fours:40+10=50, tens eights:40+9=49.\n\nSo, adding up, fours:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nEights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. For example, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, each page has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nIn the units place, both appear 49 times.\n\nSo, total fours:188, eights:98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we find that the digit 4 appears 188 times, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. Subtracting these gives the difference.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8. So, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should count the occurrences of each digit separately in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by counting the number of 4's in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the range 1-488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is in the remaining 8, so that's one more 4. So total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each group of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many complete groups of 100 are there in 488? That's 4 complete groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488). In each of the 4 complete groups, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10=40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's another 10 times. So total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNext, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, meaning the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that again. Units place: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 more in 484, total 49. Tens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in the last partial hundred (401-488), from 440-449, which is 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, counting in units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? As before, 48 complete groups and 8 extra. So, 48 times in the units place. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each group of 100 has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Units place: 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 in 488, total 49. Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times, so 40 + 9 = 49. Hundreds place: 0. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's, in the tens place, I considered 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480 is included, right? So, from 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, 9 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place. So, 40 (from the full hundreds) + 9 = 49, which is correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's: 98. The difference is 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the 4's in the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 10 more in the tens place beyond the 40 from the full hundreds.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, 48 full groups plus 1 in 484, so 49. That seems right.\n\nAnd for the 8's, units place: 48 full groups plus 1 in 488, so 49. Tens place: 40 from the full hundreds plus 9 from 480-488, so 49. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should approach this by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, for example, 4,14,24,...,484. To find the total number, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, and then there's a remainder of 8. But wait, in each group of 10, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so the digit 4 appears exactly once in each group. So, 48 groups would give 48 times, and then in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, units place: 48 times 4. Now, for the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Each full hundred contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. But we're looking for the tens digit being 4. Wait, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, ..., 8 in 481-488. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. Therefore, the total for the tens place is 40 (from the full hundreds) + 10 (from the partial hundred) = 50 times. Now, for the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times the digit 4 in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Now, let me check if I did that right. Units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so in 488 pages, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each group of 10 has one 8, so 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, with 8 remaining. So, 48 times in the units place from the full groups, and in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so that's one more 8. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full hundreds in 488, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, that's 9 times the digit 8 in the tens place. Therefore, total for tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because 49 + 49 is 98. So, 4's are 187 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me go back. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers, correct. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's, I had 50 times. Let me check that again. Each full hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 full hundreds would be 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, making 50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 times, because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and the last group only goes up to 488, so units digit 4 doesn't appear again. So, 48 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nNow, for 8's: units place is 49 times, tens place is 49 times, and hundreds place is 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make a mistake in the ranges. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: For each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, units: 48.\n\nTens place: For each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, tens: 40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: Each 10 numbers, 8 appears once. 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 8, so that's one more. So, units: 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: Each 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 more. So, tens: 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo find this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once.\n   - There are 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing one '4'.\n   - Total in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds, contributing 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488), '4' appears in 440-449, adding 10.\n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400-488, '4' appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, '8' appears once.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing one '8'.\n   - In the last 8 numbers (481-488), '8' appears once.\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, '8' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488), '8' appears in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Since the book ends at 488, '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

Let me start by considering each position one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in each position.\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. How many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last set ends at 480, so the remaining 8 pages (481-488) don't add another 4 in the units place. So, units place gives 48 fours.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. Let's figure out how many hundreds are in 488. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40 fours. Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488. The tens digit here is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them all up: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, giving 48 eights. The last 8 numbers (481-488) do include 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so actually, that's one more. Wait, no, because 488 is included in the 481-488 range, but since 488 is the last page, the units digit 8 occurs once more. So, units place gives 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, let me double-check. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480), giving 48 eights, and then 481-488 adds one more 8 (at 488). So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: The tens digit is 8 for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many full hundreds are there? 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10 = 40 eights. Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488. The tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nAdding them up: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights in total.\n\nNow, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, for the tens place in fours, I had 50 fours. Let me recount:\n\nTens place for fours:\n\n- 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours\n- 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours\n- 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours\n- 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours\n- 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours (since 440-449 is within 400-488)\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 5 sets of 10, but wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. That's correct.\n\nFor eights in the tens place:\n\n- Each hundred contributes 10 eights, except the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, from 1-400, each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for fours: 48 complete sets (1-480), so 48 fours. Then, 481-488: 481,482,...,488. The units digits here are 1-8, so no additional fours. So, units place fours: 48.\n\nWait, earlier I thought 488 has an 8, so units place fours: 48, eights: 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nSo, total fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nEights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we find that the digit 4 appears 187 times, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. Subtracting these gives 89 more fours than eights.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{89}."

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's think about the units place. For every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once every ten numbers. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, for the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, except for the last set which only goes up to 8. So, for the units place, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nFor 4's in the units place: Each complete set of ten has one 4, so 48 sets give 48 fours. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, there's one more 4 in the units place. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: Each complete set has one 8, so 48 eights. In the last partial set, units digits go up to 8, so there's one more 8. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's the same number. So, so far, the count for 4's and 8's in the units place is equal. Hmm, but I'm not done yet because I also need to check the tens place and the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, for each complete hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 complete hundreds, each digit appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, no, 401-410 would have tens digit 0, 411-420 would have 1, and so on up to 480-488, which has tens digit 8. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times in a complete hundred, but in the partial hundred, the tens digits go up to 8, but how many times does each digit appear?\n\nWait, let me think again. From 401 to 488, that's 88 numbers. The tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers.\n\n411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, up to 471-480: tens digit 7, 10 numbers.\n\nThen, 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place for 401-488, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, for the tens place in the last partial hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place:\n\nFor digit 4: 4 complete hundreds give 40 times, plus 10 times in the partial hundred, so total 50 times.\n\nFor digit 8: 4 complete hundreds give 40 times, plus 8 times in the partial hundred, so total 48 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only non-zero for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which isn't printed, I think. So, starting from 100, the hundreds digit is 1, then 2, etc., up to 4 (for 400-488). So, how many times does each hundreds digit appear?\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, 100 times.\n\n200-299: hundreds digit is 2, 100 times.\n\n300-399: hundreds digit is 3, 100 times.\n\n400-488: hundreds digit is 4, 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nWait, is that correct? Wait, 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds digit 8 would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n\n- Tens place: 50 times\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's compute that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n\n- Tens place: 48 times\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract 8's from 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFor 488 pages, units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so one more 4 and one more 8. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4's and 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10 = 40 times for each digit. Then, the last partial hundred (401-488) has tens digits from 0 to 8. For 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, but the last part is only 8 pages (481-488), so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times. So, for 4's in the tens place, 40 + 10 = 50, since in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, for 8's, 40 + 8 = 48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 100-199: 100 pages, hundreds digit 1.\n\n200-299: 100 pages, hundreds digit 2.\n\n300-399: 100 pages, hundreds digit 3.\n\n400-488: 89 pages, hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract. Let me try that.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: As before, 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Plus, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digit 4 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Plus, in the last 8 pages, units digit 8 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, but wait, in the tens place, each occurrence is per ten. Wait, no, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, 480 is the first page with tens digit 8 in the 401-488 range. Then, 481-488 is 8 more pages, but 480 is the 9th page in that group. Wait, 480 is included in the 401-488 range, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred. So, in the tens place, 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The last partial hundred is 401-488, which is 88 pages. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). For each tens digit, how many times does it appear? For tens digit 0: 10 pages (401-410). Tens digit 1: 10 pages (411-420). Similarly up to tens digit 7: 10 pages (471-480). Then, tens digit 8: from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, total for 8's in the tens place: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from last partial hundred) = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that's different from what I had before. So, earlier I thought it was 8 times, but now it's 9 times. Hmm, so that changes the total.\n\nSo, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n\n- Tens place: 49\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, now, let's recalculate the total 8's as 98, and 4's as 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 91, but now it's 90. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let's go back. When considering the tens place for 8's in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's 9 times. So, in the tens place, 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, units place: 49\n\nTens place: 49\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the tens place for 8's was 48, leading to 97 total 8's. So, that was a mistake. So, correct total 8's is 98.\n\nSo, number of 4's: 188\n\nNumber of 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so earlier I had 91, but now it's 90. So, I must have made a mistake in the tens place count for 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's.\n\nIn the last partial hundred, 401-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nThe tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488. That's 9 pages: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, that's 9 times, not 8. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, total for 8's in tens place: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from last partial hundred) = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 188, 8's is 98, so difference is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 91. So, I must have miscalculated the tens place for 8's earlier.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nIn the units place, both 4's and 8's have 49 each.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n\n- 8's: 49\n\nIn the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place for 8's was 48, leading to 97 total 8's, but that was incorrect. The correct count is 49 in the tens place, leading to 98 total 8's.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me recount the tens place for 8's.\n\nIn the complete hundreds (1-400), each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, 8's in tens place: 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the last partial hundred's tens digit 8 was 8 times, but now I see it's 9 times. So, I think the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, another way to check: Maybe I can list out the counts for each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: 48 full tens (48*1) + 1 in the last 8 pages = 49\n\n- 8's: same as 4's in units place: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 4 full hundreds (4*10) + 10 in the last partial hundred (440-449) = 50\n\n- 8's: 4 full hundreds (4*10) + 9 in the last partial hundred (480-488) = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 (400-488)\n\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct now. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Range:**\n   - The book has 488 pages, so page numbers range from 1 to 488.\n\n2. **Count Digit Occurrences:**\n   - We'll count occurrences of the digit 4 and 8 in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds).\n\n3. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets (480 pages) with 8 remaining pages.\n   - **4's:** 48 times in complete sets + 1 in the remaining 8 pages = 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n4. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds in 488: 4 (1-400).\n   - **4's:** 4 * 10 = 40 + 10 in 440-449 = 50.\n   - **8's:** 4 * 10 = 40 + 9 in 480-488 = 49.\n\n5. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (not printed).\n   - Pages 100-199: hundreds digit 1 (100 times).\n   - Pages 200-299: hundreds digit 2 (100 times).\n   - Pages 300-399: hundreds digit 3 (100 times).\n   - Pages 400-488: hundreds digit 4 (89 times).\n   - **4's:** 89 times.\n   - **8's:** 0 times (since 800+ pages don't exist).\n\n6. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n7. **Calculate Difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the range 1-488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Now, the extra 8 numbers are 481-488, so the units digits here are 1-8. The digit 4 appears once in these as well, so that's 48 + 1 = 49 times for the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 101-200, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, another 10 times. This pattern continues up to 400-488. Let me calculate how many complete hundreds there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in this range, which is 10 numbers (440-449). Wait, but 401-488 includes 401-499, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that to the previous 40, we get 40 + 10 = 50 times for the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to count how many times 4 appears in each page number, so I should sum up the occurrences in units, tens, and hundreds places. So, units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. Adding them up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Again, for every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1, so 48 times. The extra 8 numbers are 481-488, so the units digits here go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in these as well, making it 48 + 1 = 49 times for the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8. Similar to 4, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in 1-400, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Well, 400 divided by 100 is 4, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 40 (from 1-400) plus 9 = 49 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8. The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 times for 8.\n\nSo, total occurrences of 8 are units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Adding up: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4 appears 188 times and 8 appears 98 times. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nBut wait, let me check the tens place for 8 again. I said that in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's correct. So, 9 times in the tens place for 8 in the last 88 pages. So, 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nAnd for 4's, in the tens place, I had 50 times. Let me check that again. In 1-400, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, in 1-400, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds would be 40. But wait, 400 is the end, so in 400, the tens digit is 0, so 440-449 is within 401-488, which is part of the last 88 pages. So, in 1-400, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10). That's 4 times 10, which is 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50. That's correct.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nNow, let me check the hundreds place for 4. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4 appears 188 times, 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. With 48 complete groups of 10 (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488), the total is 48 + 1 = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times in each hundred (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contributing 40, plus 10 times in 440-449, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times in each hundred. In 1-400, that's 40 times. In 401-488, 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times), totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 never appears since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds. Let me start with the units place. For the units digit, in each set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once, and the same goes for 8. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4), and 8 appears once (at 8). This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete set, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, and the same for 8's. But wait, the last 8 numbers (481-488) also have a units digit. Let me check how many 4's and 8's are in those. From 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's. Wait, no, actually, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the units digits are 1-8. So, in this last partial set, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding that to the 48 complete sets, the units place has 49 4's and 49 8's. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set for 8's in the tens place would be 480-488. Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, and 340-349: 10. Now, 440-449: that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets, 10 each, so 50 times 4 in the tens place. Now, for the 8's in the tens place. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Therefore, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place. Now, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see when 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, when does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, in a three-digit number, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place. Now, let me sum up the counts for each digit place. For the units place: 49 4's and 49 8's. For the tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's. For the hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 4's and 49 8's. In the tens place, 50 4's and 49 8's. In the hundreds place, 89 4's and 0 8's. So, adding up 49 + 50 + 89 for 4's: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. For 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 is 98. So, 188 - 98 is 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nUnits place: Each 10 numbers, 1 four and 1 eight. 488 pages means 48 full tens and 8 extra. So, 48 * 1 = 48 for each digit, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That's correct.\n\nTens place: For 4's, it's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 10 each, totaling 50. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four are 10 each, so 40, and the last one is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. No 8's in the hundreds place. So, 89 - 0 = 89. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up: 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I'm a bit surprised it's 90. Let me think about another approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately and then sum them up.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48 full tens, each contributing 1 four, so 48. Plus, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: same logic, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: Each hundred has a block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each contributes 10. How many such blocks are there? From 40-49: 1 block, 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.\n\nNumber of 8's in tens place: Similarly, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four are full blocks of 10, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, is only 9 numbers, so 9. Total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: 400-488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNumber of 8's in hundreds place: 0, since the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I count the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but does each of those have a 4 in the hundreds place? Yes, because 400 is the first, and each number up to 488 has 4 as the hundreds digit. So, 89 4's there.\n\nAnd in the tens place, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, but the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's counted in the tens place for 8's. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my earlier calculation is correct. So, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Analyze Each Digit Place Separately:**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Every 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) have one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n     - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n     - Each set contributes 1 four and 1 eight, totaling 48 fours and 48 eights.\n     - The last partial set (481-488) adds one more four (484) and one more eight (488).\n     - **Total Units Place:** 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Fours appear in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each range contributes 10 fours.\n     - Number of such ranges: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - **Total Fours in Tens Place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n     - Eights appear in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each full range contributes 10 eights.\n     - Number of full ranges: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n     - The last partial range (480-488) contributes 9 eights.\n     - **Total Eights in Tens Place:** 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - Fours appear from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n     - **Total Fours in Hundreds Place:** 89.\n     - Eights do not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - **Total Eights in Hundreds Place:** 0.\n\n2. **Sum the Counts:**\n   - **Total Fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total Eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.  \n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let's start by counting the number of 4's in each position.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. In the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. But I need to consider the entire range up to 488.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position separately.\n\nStarting with the units place for 4's:\n\nHow many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and an extra 8 pages. In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at 484. So, that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place:\n\nAgain, 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. In the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\nWait, so so far, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake because the last partial group might not always have the digit. Let me check. For 4's in units place: up to 488, the last page is 488, so the units digits go up to 8. So, 484 is within 481-488, so yes, one more 4. Similarly, 488 ends with 8, so that's one more 8. So, both 4 and 8 have 49 in units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 times. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is 88 pages. The tens digit cycles every 10. So, from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit 1; 421-430, tens digit 2; 431-440, tens digit 3; 441-450, tens digit 4. Wait, no, actually, 440-449 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 times. So, 40 (from the first 400 pages) plus 10 (from 440-449) equals 50 times 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, how about 8 in the tens place. Let's do the same. In each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 times. So, from 1-100, 80-89: 10 times. Similarly, 180-189: 10 times, and so on. So, in 400 pages, that's 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. Therefore, total 40 + 9 = 49 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 has one more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, how about 8 in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with units place for 4: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, adding one more, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8 in units place: same logic, 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 8, and the last partial group includes 488, so one more, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4: Each hundred contributes 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, making it 50. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8: Each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more, making it 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8: Since the book ends at 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up, 4's total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's total: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I think about the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is a significant number. Let me confirm that.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nAnother way to think about it: 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's total: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - In every group of 10 numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20), '4' appears once in the units place.\n     - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '4's.\n     - In the last partial group (481-488), '4' appears once (at 484).\n     - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - In every group of 100 numbers, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n     - There are 4 complete groups of 100, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 '4's.\n     - In the last partial group (401-488), '4' appears 10 times in 440-449.\n     - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - From page 400 to 488, '4' appears in the hundreds place for 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1).\n     - Total: 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting '8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Similar to '4's, '8' appears once every 10 numbers.\n     - 48 complete groups contribute 48 '8's, plus one in 488.\n     - Total: 49.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - '8' appears 10 times in every 100 numbers (e.g., 80-89).\n     - 4 complete groups contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 '8's.\n     - In the last partial group (401-488), '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - No pages have '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - Total: 0.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start with the units place because that might be simpler.\n\nFor the units place, I can think about how often each digit appears. In the range 1-488, every digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except maybe the last few numbers if 488 isn't a multiple of 10. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, for each digit 0-9, they each appear 48 times in the units place. But wait, does that include 0? Because page numbers start at 1, so 0 doesn't appear in the units place for page 1. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nActually, for the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears the same number of times except possibly in the last partial group. Since 488 is 48*10 + 8, the units digit cycles 0-9 forty-eight times, and then one more time from 0 to 8. So, for each digit 0-9, they appear 48 times in the units place. But for digits 1-9, they also appear once more in the last partial group if the digit is \u22648. Wait, no, the last partial group is 481-488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, digits 1-8 appear once more, and 9 doesn't. So, for units place:\n\n- Digits 0: 48 times\n- Digits 1-8: 48 + 1 = 49 times each\n- Digit 9: 48 times\n\nWait, that seems right because from 1-480, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place. Then from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so each of those digits gets an extra count. So, digits 1-8 have 49 counts, and 0 and 9 have 48.\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's is 49, and the number of 8's is also 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each block of 100, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488 is the incomplete hundred.\n\nEach complete hundred block contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times each digit appears in the tens place. Now, for the incomplete block, 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, each digit 0-8 appears 9 times (from 401-480) and then 481-488 adds 8 more numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, no, 401-480 is 80 numbers, so the tens digits cycle 0-7, each appearing 10 times, but wait, 401-480 is 80 numbers, so the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 7 (471-480). So, each tens digit from 0-7 appears 10 times in 401-480. Then, 481-488 has tens digit 8, which is 8 numbers. So, for the tens place in 401-488:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 10 times each\n- Digit 8: 8 times\n\nSo, adding this to the 40 times from the complete hundreds:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 40 + 10 = 50 times each\n- Digit 8: 40 + 8 = 48 times\n- Digit 9: 40 times (since 401-488 doesn't include any 9 in the tens place)\n\nWait, but actually, in the complete hundreds, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, in 401-488, digits 0-7 get an extra 10 each, and 8 gets an extra 8. So, total for tens place:\n\n- 0: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 1: 40 + 10 = 50\n- ...\n- 7: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8: 40 + 8 = 48\n- 9: 40\n\nSo, in the tens place, the number of 4's is 50, and the number of 8's is 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, in 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 1: 100-199 \u2192 100 times\n- 2: 200-299 \u2192 100 times\n- 3: 300-399 \u2192 100 times\n- 4: 400-488 \u2192 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n- 0: 1-99 \u2192 0 times\n- 5-9: 0 times\n\nWait, but actually, the hundreds digit is only present from 100 onwards, so:\n\n- 1: 100-199 \u2192 100 pages\n- 2: 200-299 \u2192 100 pages\n- 3: 300-399 \u2192 100 pages\n- 4: 400-488 \u2192 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n- 5-9: 0 pages\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 1: 100\n- 2: 100\n- 3: 100\n- 4: 89\n- 0: 0\n- 5-9: 0\n\nSo, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89, and 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 48\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188\n\n8's: 49 + 48 = 97; 97 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n- Pages 481-488 add 8 more counts for digits 1-8.\n- **4's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n- **8's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place for the first 400 pages.\n- Pages 401-480 add 10 more counts for digits 0-7, and pages 481-488 add 8 counts for digit 8.\n- **4's:** 40 + 10 = 50\n- **8's:** 40 + 8 = 48\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- Digits 1, 2, 3 each appear 100 times.\n- Digit 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n- **4's:** 89\n- **8's:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n\\boxed{91}"
