    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 full blocks and a remainder of 8. So, in each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last block is only 8 numbers, from 481 to 488. In that, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, in every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place, so 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488. In each full block, there are 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, ..., up to 8 for 480-488. Wait, but in the tens place, 401-488: the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, etc., but actually, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 only in 401-409 (9 numbers) and then 1-8 in the subsequent decades. But wait, I'm looking for the tens digit being 4. So, in the range 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place. So total for tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, that's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add those up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Again, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such blocks? 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks and 8 remaining numbers. So, in each full block, 1 occurrence, so 48. In the last block, from 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In every block of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many full blocks? 488 divided by 100 is 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Now, the partial block from 401-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 8's, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. That seems right.\n\nUnits place for both digits: 49 each, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Every 10 numbers have one 4, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers have 10 occurrences, plus an additional 10 in 440-449, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 gives 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Every 10 numbers have one 8, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers have 10 occurrences, plus an additional 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, the total number of blocks of 10 is 48 (because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). But since we can't have a fraction of a block, I think I should take the integer part, which is 48 blocks. Each block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, does the last block (481-490) go up to 488? So, actually, from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 would occur at 484. So, I think my initial thought was correct; each block of 10 contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so maybe I should check if 488 is included. Hmm, but 488 is in the hundreds place, so maybe the units digit 4 occurs at 484, which is within the 480-489 range, but since we only go up to 488, it's still included. So, I think 48 times for the units digit 4.\n\nNext, the tens place: In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and 240-249, and 340-349. So, each hundred block has a 10-number span where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 is in the 400-488 range, so let's see: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So that's five blocks, but wait, the 400-488 block isn't a full hundred, it's only 89 numbers (from 400 to 488). But for the tens digit, the 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contribute 10 4's in the tens place. So, for each full hundred, there are 10 4's in the tens place. How many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4*100 + 88, so up to 400, that's four full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Wait, actually, 0-99 is the first hundred, 100-199 the second, 200-299 the third, and 300-399 the fourth. Then 400-488 is the fifth block, but it's not a full hundred. So, in each of the first four hundreds, there's a 40-49 block, contributing 10 4's each. So that's 4*10 = 40 4's in the tens place from the first four hundreds. Now, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, right? Because 400-409 would have a tens digit of 0, 410-419 tens digit 1, and so on. So, 440-449 is where the tens digit is 4 in the 400-488 range. How many numbers is that? From 440 to 449, that's 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought of 400-488 as the fifth block, but actually, the hundreds digit 4 starts at 400, so every page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89 4's.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, in each block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-10, it's 8; 11-20, it's 18; and so on. So, how many blocks of 10 are there up to 488? As before, 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is in the 480-489 block, but we stop at 488. So, in the units place, 8 occurs at 488, which is included. So, 48 times for units digit 8.\n\nNext, tens place: In the tens place, the digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many full blocks of 100 are there? Up to 400, we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, there's a block where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 8's each. So, that's 4 blocks, each with 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the block, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens digit 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 48, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 187, total 8's are 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times, correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, and there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40 + 10 = 50, correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89, correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48, correct.\n\nTens place: Each of the first four hundreds contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49, correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, that might not be entirely accurate because the last set might not complete. Let me check: The last page is 488, so the units digit cycles up to 8. So, the last complete set is 480-488. In this case, the units digit 4 appears in 484, which is within this set. So, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears 49 times because from 1-480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4, and then in 481-488, there's another 4 in 484. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. \n\nActually, for the units place, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens and a partial tenth. Each full ten contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Now, in the partial tenth (481-488), does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, it does. So that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. From 1 to 480, that's exactly 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Here, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these sets has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such sets are there? From 0 to 488, we have:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total tens place 4's are 5*10 = 50.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-100, 40-49: 10 numbers. From 101-200, 140-149: 10 numbers. From 201-300, 240-249: 10 numbers. From 301-400, 340-349: 10 numbers. From 401-500, 440-449: 10 numbers. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct. So, total tens place 4's are 50.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488 inclusive is indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. The digit 8 appears in the units place for numbers ending with 8: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there?\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one such number. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens and a partial tenth. So, 48 numbers ending with 8 in the units place, and then in the partial tenth (481-488), the number 488 ends with 8, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: from 1-480, there are 48 numbers ending with 8 (8,18,...,478). Then, 488 is the 49th number ending with 8. So, yes, 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is valid. Each of these sets has 10 numbers, except maybe the last one.\n\nLet me count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I had 5 sets of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full sets of 10 and one partial set of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to consider that in each digit place, the count is as follows:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, no, actually, the formula is a bit different. Let me recall that the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10)*1 + min(max(n%10 - d +1, 0), 10). Hmm, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, since 488 is less than 500, maybe my initial counting is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, I think my counting is accurate.\n\nSo, I think the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (480 numbers) and an additional 8 numbers (481-488). In the full decades, 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. In 481-488, 484 contributes one more, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades and an additional 8 numbers (481-488). In the full decades, 48 occurrences of 8 in the units place. In 481-488, 488 contributes one more, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, totaling 40. The last set (480-488) contributes 9, making a total of 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of ten and then 8 more numbers. So, in each group, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers in each hundred. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many such groups there are. From 1 to 488, we have four complete hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. Each hundred has one group where the tens digit is 4, so that's four groups. Each group contributes 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is part of the 400-499 range, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 4 x 10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has one group where the tens digit is 4, so that's four groups, each contributing 10, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total 4's in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: For every group of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, similar to the 4's, but let's check. From 1 to 488, how many groups of ten? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 8 is in 488, so that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers in each hundred. So, for example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 numbers. So, from 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has one such group. That's four groups, each contributing 10, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, does the tens digit 8 appear? Yes, 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 8's in tens place. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. So that's 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 more. So total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Wait, in the units place, I had 49, and in the tens place, 49, so total 98. But let me check the tens place again. From 1-399, there are four groups of 10 where the tens digit is 8, each contributing 10 8's, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49 in the tens place. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but when I calculated 4's, I had 188, and 8's as 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount the 8's. Units place: 49, correct. Tens place: 49, correct. Hundreds place: 0, correct. So total 8's: 98.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the 4's, I had 49 in units, 50 in tens, and 89 in hundreds, totaling 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems like a lot. Let me check if I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's in the tens place. From 1-99, the tens digit 4 is in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. So that's 4 x 10 = 40. Then, 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's, units place: 49, correct. Tens place: 49, correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 98 total.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I was counting the 8's in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 8's there. So, 40 (from 1-399) + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nWait, but another way to check: total number of 8's in the tens place from 1-488. Each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would have 40, plus in the 400-488, 9 more. So, 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place: 49. So, total 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think if I missed any 8's in the hundreds place. No, because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit is only 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** For every group of 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place. There are 48 full groups (1-480) and one partial group (481-488) which includes 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are four complete hundreds (1-399) contributing 40, plus 440-449 in the 400-488 range, adding 10. Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears in all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4's, '8' appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full groups and one in the partial group (488). Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). Four complete hundreds contribute 40, plus 480-488 (9 numbers) in the 400-488 range. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. \n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for the units digit, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Each ten has one 4, so the number of 4's in the units place would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a digit, I think it's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last set is 481-490, but since the book stops at 488, the units digit 4 in 484 would be the last 4 in the units place. Wait, no, maybe I should think differently. \n\nActually, for each complete set of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete tens in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last set is 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so in the units place, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). Therefore, total units place 4's would be 48 (from the complete sets) plus 1, making it 49. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place 8's: Each set of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, again, 48 complete sets would give 48 eights, and in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 8 appears at 488. So, that's one more, making it 49 eights in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so yes, 488 is page 488, so the units digit 8 appears once in that last partial set. So, units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, for each hundred, 10 times. Since we have 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nSo, in the first 400 pages, we have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4. That's 10 pages, so 10 times. Therefore, total tens place 4's would be 40 (from the first 400) plus 10 (from 440-449), totaling 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place 8's: In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 eights. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. That's 9 pages (480-488), so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, total tens place 8's would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 9 times. So, tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. Therefore, hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nHow about the hundreds place 8's? Well, in the hundreds place, the digit 8 would appear from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\nThat seems correct because each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place over the range, except possibly the last partial set. But I accounted for that by adding 1 for both 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\nYes, because in the last partial set, 480-488 gives 9 eights in the tens place, but 440-449 gives 10 fours.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89 (from 400-488)\n- 8's: 0\nThat's correct because the book doesn't go beyond 488, so hundreds digit 8 never occurs.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those pages, which is correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for the tens place, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So, 40 from the first 400 pages plus 10, totaling 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit 8, in the last partial hundred, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times, plus 40 from the first 400, totaling 49.\n\nUnits digits: 49 each for 4 and 8.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Range:** The book has pages from 1 to 488.\n\n2. **Count Occurrences of Each Digit in Each Place:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - **4's:** In every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. For 488 pages, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 fours. The last partial set (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more, totaling 49.\n     - **8's:** Similarly, 8 appears once per 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - **4's:** Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49). For 400 pages, 4 hundreds contribute 40 fours. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10, totaling 50.\n     - **8's:** Each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place. For 400 pages, 40 eights. The last partial hundred includes 480-488, adding 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - **4's:** Pages 400-488 have 89 numbers with hundreds digit 4.\n     - **8's:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n3. **Sum the Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each position in the page numbers separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, from 1-10, the 4 is in 4; from 11-20, it's in 14; and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an additional 8 pages. In each of these 48 blocks, the 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 484 is the only one where the units digit is 4. So, that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in every block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, which is 10 times. Now, up to 488, how many full hundreds are there? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the first four hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), let's look at the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Specifically, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is only 8 numbers, right? So, in the tens place for 401-488, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. So, adding that, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows: 401-410 (tens digit 0), 411-420 (1), 421-430 (2), 431-440 (3), 441-450 (4), 451-460 (5), 461-470 (6), 471-480 (7), and 481-488 (8). So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, yes, 10 more 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first page, so 400-488 is indeed 89 pages. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the 8's. I'll do the same process: count the number of 8's in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in each block of 10, the digit 8 appears once. So, up to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, 488 is the only one where the units digit is 8. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, for each hundred, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, up to 488, we have four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8 as before. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, but wait, 480-488 is actually 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, 480 is the first, and 488 is the last, so that's 9 numbers, right? So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 401-488. Wait, but 480 is part of 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So, adding that, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188 seems high for 4's. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nFor the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds contribute 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds contribute 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as the book doesn't reach 800. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small program or use another counting method to verify, but since I can't do that right now, I'll just go through the logic again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for the 4's. Let me see: from 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For the 4's, in the hundreds place, it's 89 times. In the tens place, it's 50 times, and in the units place, 49 times. 89 + 50 is 139, plus 49 is 188.\n\nFor the 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So, 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the hundreds place for 4's seems high. Let me consider: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's only from 400-488, which is 89 times. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider each digit place separately, but I think I did that already.\n\nWait, another approach: count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place from 1 to 488.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last partial block has a 4, which it does (484), so 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last partial block has an 8, which it does (488), so 49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100) = 4, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles 0-8. The digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. Total 50.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/100) = 4, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. Total 49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: none, as the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** In every block of 10 numbers, '4' appears once. There are 48 full blocks (1-480), contributing 48 '4's. The last 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every block of 100 numbers, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place. Four blocks (1-400) contribute 40 '4's. In 401-488, '4' appears in 440-449 (10 times). Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, '4' appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears once every 10 numbers. 48 full blocks contribute 48 '8's. The last block includes 488, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every block of 100, '8' appears 10 times. Four blocks contribute 40 '8's. In 401-488, '8' appears in 480-488 (9 times). Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll count the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then add them up.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's:\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4. So that's 48 fours. But wait, the last group is from 481 to 488, so does that include a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484. So actually, it's 49 times? Wait, no. Because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490). But since the book only goes up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So in the units place, each group contributes one 4, so 48 groups would have 48 fours, but the last group only goes up to 488, so does it include a 4? Let me think: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So yes, 484 is in this group, so that's another 4. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, because the first group (1-10) has 4 in the units place once, the second group (11-20) has 4 once, and so on up to the 48th group (471-480), which would have 484 as the 4 in the units place. Then the 49th group would be 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so in that partial group, we have 484 as the units 4. So actually, it's 48 complete groups (each contributing one 4) plus one more in the incomplete group, making it 49 units place 4's.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think of it differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and taking the integer part, then adding 1 if the digit is less than the last digit. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me just list it out.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So for each 10 numbers, the units digit 4 appears once. So total number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times, but since 488 is the last page, and 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, so we have an additional 4 in the units place at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, because floor(488/10) is 48, which counts the number of complete decades, each contributing one 4. But since 488 is beyond 480, the 48th decade is 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so in that decade, the units digit 4 occurs once at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 (from 1-480) +1 (from 481-488) = 49.\n\nWait, but 1-480 has 48 decades, each contributing one 4, so that's 48. Then 481-488 is the next 8 numbers, which includes 484, so that's one more, making it 49.\n\nOkay, so units place: 49 fours.\n\nNow, tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. But wait, since the book only goes up to 488, the last block would be 440-449, which is fully included, as 449 is less than 488. So how many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 0-99: 40-49: 10 fours\nFrom 100-199: 140-149: 10 fours\nFrom 200-299: 240-249: 10 fours\nFrom 300-399: 340-349: 10 fours\nFrom 400-488: 440-449: 10 fours\n\nSo that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So total tens place fours: 50.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each page number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 +50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? That seems high. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, units place: 49 fours\nTens place: 50 fours\nHundreds place: 89 fours\nTotal fours: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, but let me think if that's correct.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each block of 100 contributes one block of 10 fours, so from 0-99: 40-49, 10 fours\n100-199:140-149, 10 fours\n200-299:240-249,10 fours\n300-399:340-349,10 fours\n400-488:440-449,10 fours (since 440-449 is within 400-488)\nSo that's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 5*10=50.\n\nUnits place: For each 10 numbers, one 4, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full decades, each with one 4, and then in the last partial decade (481-488), there's a 4 at 484, so 48+1=49.\n\nSo 49+50+89=188 fours.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to fours, but let's go through it.\n\nUnits place: For each 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once. So from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place?\n\nNumber of complete decades: floor(488/10)=48, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488. So that's one more 8. So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the book, so let's check each block.\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89:10 eights\nFrom 100-199:180-189:10 eights\nFrom 200-299:280-289:10 eights\nFrom 300-399:380-389:10 eights\nFrom 400-488:480-488: how many? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (each contributing 10 eights) and one block of 9. So 4*10 +9=40+9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89:10\n180-189:10\n280-289:10\n380-389:10\n480-488:9\nTotal: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nYes, so tens place eights:49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nWait, so total fours:188, total eights:98. So the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me recount the fours:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place:50\nHundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:49\nHundreds place:0\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for fours. Let me check again.\n\nFor the tens place fours:\n\nFrom 0-99:40-49:10 fours\n100-199:140-149:10 fours\n200-299:240-249:10 fours\n300-399:340-349:10 fours\n400-488:440-449:10 fours (since 440-449 is within 400-488)\nSo that's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nFor the eights in the tens place:\n\nFrom 0-99:80-89:10 eights\n100-199:180-189:10 eights\n200-299:280-289:10 eights\n300-399:380-389:10 eights\n400-488:480-488:9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers)\nTotal:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the units place for fours and eights?\n\nUnits place fours:49\nUnits place eights:49\n\nYes, because each decade has one 4 and one 8 in the units place, except possibly the last one.\n\nWait, but in the last partial decade (481-488), for units place fours, we have 484, which is one 4. For units place eights, we have 488, which is one 8. So both have one extra in the last partial decade, so units place counts are both 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total fours:188\nTotal eights:98\nDifference:90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. For fours, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nFor eights, there are no page numbers in 800-899, so hundreds place eights:0.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 fours.\n   - The last partial group (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n   - **Total units place 4's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place for blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 fours.\n   - **Total tens place 4's:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488.\n   - This is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - **Total hundreds place 4's:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, each group of 10 contributes one 8.\n   - 48 complete groups and one in the last partial group (488).\n   - **Total units place 8's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full blocks contributing 10 eights each, and one partial block (480-488) contributing 9.\n   - **Total tens place 8's:** 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - **Total hundreds place 8's:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each position for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: In every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Since the book has 488 pages, the last set of ten would be 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the last number is 488. So, how many complete sets of ten are there? From 1 to 488, that's 48 full sets (since 48*10=480) and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. That's 48 times. Then, in the extra numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in every block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 instances where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 5*10=50. But wait, does the 440-449 block go up to 488? Yes, because 440-449 is within 488. So, that's 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, looking at the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, actually, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's printed are 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4, in the units place, 8 appears once every ten numbers. So, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, each set of ten has one 8, so 48 full sets (up to 480) and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In the 48 full sets, that's 48 8's. In the extra numbers, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: For the tens place, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 instances where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks there are up to 488. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks. Each contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Now, does 480-489 have any 8's in the tens place? Yes, 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, the tens digit here is 8 for all these numbers (since 480-488 has tens digit 8). So, how many numbers? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, adding that, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, looking at the hundreds place, 8 would appear in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times. That seems right because from 1-480, every ten has a 4, so 48 sets. Then, 481-488 doesn't add any more 4's in the units place.\n\n- Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each block is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total 4's: 48+50+89=187.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full sets (1-480) contributing 48 8's, plus 488, which is the 8 in units place, so total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 480-488, which is 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place, so 9. Total 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nSo, 49+49=98 for 8's.\n\nThus, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. When I counted the tens place, I considered 480-488 as having 8 in the tens place. But wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times the tens digit is 8. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's there.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, contributing 48 instances. From 481 to 488, no additional 4's in the units place. Total: 48.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 instances. Total: 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place. Total: 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 480, 48 instances. From 481-488, 488 adds one more. Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 such blocks, each contributing 10 instances, totaling 40. Additionally, from 480-488, 9 instances. Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No pages with 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. \n\nStarting with the units place. For any range of numbers, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete group of 10, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so each digit from 0-9 appears exactly once in each group. Therefore, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, and the digit 8 appears 48 times. But wait, in the partial group (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, in this partial group, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total in units place: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's = 48 + 1 = 49. So, same number in units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears in the tens place exactly 10 times in each 100 numbers. So, for each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. Now, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all pages 400-488. But for the tens place, let's see. \n\nFrom 1-400, how many hundreds? 4 hundreds. Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 times for 4's in tens place, and same for 8's. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: 1, ..., 481-490: 8, but wait, 488 is the end, so 481-488 is only 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Wait, no, 481-490 would have tens digit 8, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of those 8 numbers. So, in the tens place from 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, 440-449 would have tens digit 4, but wait, 440 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers (440-449). So, 10 times. And for 8's, as I thought, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so 8 times. Wait, but wait, 481-490 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's only 8. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4's appear 10 times, and 8's appear 8 times. So, adding to the previous 40 times from 1-400, total in tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 8 = 48. \n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times, so 4's add 10, making it 50. For 8's, in the tens place, it's from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but wait, 480 is 480, so 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only have up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, no, 480 is page 480, then 481, 482, ..., 488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, not 8. Wait, but 480 is 480, so the tens digit is 8, but 480 is included, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 is page 480, so the tens digit is 8, and 480 is included, so that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 8. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, let's correct that.\n\nSo, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. Therefore, in the tens place, 4's total is 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50, and 8's total is 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8, but it's actually 9. So, that changes the count. So, 8's in tens place: 49. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards, where the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. For each page number, the hundreds digit is 1 from 100-199, 2 from 200-299, 3 from 300-399, and 4 from 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times. \n\nNow, let's tally up all the digits. \n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in units place? Every 10 pages, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 four, so 48. Then, the last partial cycle is pages 481-488, which includes 484, so that's one more, making it 49. Similarly for 8's: 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 eight, and the last partial cycle includes 488, so one more, making it 49. So, units place: 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n- From 1-400, each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's.\n- From 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more for 4's, making it 50.\n- The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more for 8's, making it 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488).\n- 8 never appears.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so that's 89. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by considering each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Similarly, the number of times the digit 8 appears is calculated. \n\n- **Units place**: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n- **Tens place**: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place**: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding these up, the total number of 4's is 49 + 50 + 89 = 188, and the total number of 8's is 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. \n\nFirst, let's handle the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. In each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. However, since we're starting from 1, the first set is 1-10, so the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). \n\nIn each complete block, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 blocks give 48 fours. Similarly, 8 appears once per block, so 48 eights. \n\nNow, the partial block from 481 to 488: the units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial block, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nSo, total units place: 48 fours + 1 four = 49 fours. Similarly, 48 eights + 1 eight = 49 eights. \n\nWait, but hold on, that seems like the same number. But maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. \n\nWait, no, actually, in the partial block, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, yes, that's correct. So, units place gives 49 fours and 49 eights. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's, so maybe I'm missing something. Let me move on and check the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, the digits cycle every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. \n\nSo, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range. \n\nSo, for each complete hundred, we have 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights. \n\nNow, for the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, 440-449 would have 4 in the tens place, but wait, 440 is beyond 488, so actually, in 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8. So, the tens digit 4 would appear in 440-449, but 440 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers: 440-449. So, that's 10 fours in the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit 8 would appear in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. \n\nWait, let me make sure. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the partial hundred, tens place: 10 fours and 9 eights. \n\nSo, total tens place: 40 fours from complete hundreds + 10 fours = 50 fours. Similarly, 40 eights + 9 eights = 49 eights. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 times. \n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. \n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 fours and 0 eights. \n\nNow, let's add up all the digits across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nFirst, for fours:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's compute: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nNow, for eights:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. \n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me go back.\n\nIn the units place, I considered each block of 10, which gives 1 four and 1 eight per block. There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and a partial block of 8 pages (481-488). So, in the units place, 48 fours and 1 four in the partial block, totaling 49 fours. Similarly, 48 eights and 1 eight in the partial block, totaling 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each complete hundred, 10 fours and 10 eights. There are 4 complete hundreds, so 40 fours and 40 eights. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449), and 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place: 50 fours and 49 eights. That adds up correctly.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 appears 0 times. \n\nAdding up:\n\nFours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nEights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers from 1 to 488, then finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 of each digit.\n   - Partial block (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 fours; 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 fours (e.g., 40-49) and 10 eights (e.g., 80-89).\n   - 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4\u00d710 = 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488): 440-449 gives 10 fours; 480-488 gives 9 eights.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50 fours; 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488: 89 occurrences of 4.\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 fours; 0 eights.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, for the units place, the number of times 4 appears is 48 times (once per each group of 10) plus one more because in the last group (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). Wait, actually, in the last partial group, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once there. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4 in the units place. \n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place, each group of 10 has one 8, so 48 times, and in the last partial group, 8 appears once (at 488). So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8 in the units place. Hmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So the difference here is zero. \n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So yes, both have 48 +1 =49. So units place contributes equally, so no difference there.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. Each digit appears 10 times. \n\nBut in our case, the book goes up to 488, so we have to consider up to 488. Let's break it down by hundreds. \n\nFirst, from 1-99: The tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nNext, from 100-199: The tens digit again cycles 0-9 for each hundred. So, 4 appears 10 times (140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189). \n\nSimilarly, from 200-299: 4 appears 10 times (240-249), and 8 appears 10 times (280-289). \n\nFrom 300-399: 4 appears 10 times (340-349), and 8 appears 10 times (380-389). \n\nNow, from 400-488: The hundreds digit is 4, so the tens digit cycles again. Here, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, for the tens digit, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nWait, let me clarify. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488. But 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. \n\nSo, in the tens place, for 4, we have 10 (from 400-449) plus the previous hundreds. Let's add up all the tens places: \n\nFrom 1-99: 10 times for 4, 10 for 8. \n100-199: 10 for 4, 10 for 8. \n200-299: 10 for 4, 10 for 8. \n300-399: 10 for 4, 10 for 8. \n400-488: 10 for 4, 9 for 8. \n\nSo total for 4 in tens place: 10+10+10+10+10 = 50. \n\nFor 8 in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. That's a difference of 1 in favor of 4. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore since we're only counting 4's and 8's. \n\nFrom 100-199: The hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's here. \n\nFrom 200-299: The hundreds digit is 2, so again, no 4's or 8's. \n\nFrom 300-399: The hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's. \n\nFrom 400-488: The hundreds digit is 4, so every page from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. \n\nSo, total for hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8. \n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences for 4 and 8 across units, tens, and hundreds places. \n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) = 90. \n\nWait, that seems like a big difference. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with units place: I had 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct because from 1-480, each digit appears 48 times, and then in the last 8 pages, 481-488, 4 and 8 each appear once. So 48+1=49 each. \n\nTens place: For 4, I had 50, and for 8, 49. Let me recount. From 1-99: 10 each. 100-199: 10 each. 200-299: 10 each. 300-399: 10 each. 400-488: 10 for 4 (440-449) and 9 for 8 (480-488). So 10+10+10+10+10=50 for 4, and 10+10+10+10+9=49 for 8. That seems correct. \n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. That's correct because from 400-488, there are 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. \n\nSo total 4's: 49+50+89=188. \n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98. \n\nDifference: 188-98=90. \n\nWait, but I thought the answer was 90, but I'm a bit surprised because I expected maybe a smaller difference. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. That's correct. \n\nIn the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages, and 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 10 for 4 and 9 for 8. \n\nUnits place: 4 appears once in 484, and 8 appears once in 488. \n\nWait, but in the units place, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let me recalculate that. \n\nIn units place, for each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So from 1-480, that's 48 sets of 10, so 48 times. Then from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So total 48+1=49. \n\nSimilarly, 8 appears once in each set of 10, so 48 times, and once in 488, so 49. \n\nSo units place is correct. \n\nTens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. \n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0. \n\nSo total 4's: 49+50+89=188. \n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98. \n\nDifference: 188-98=90. \n\nWait, but I'm thinking, maybe I should check if I'm counting correctly in the tens place for 400-488. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, how many times does 4 and 8 appear? \n\nFor the tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. \n\nFor the tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. \n\nSo, yes, 10 for 4 and 9 for 8. \n\nI think my calculations are correct. So the difference is 90. \n\nWait, but I feel like 90 is a bit high. Let me try a different approach to verify. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and see if I get the same totals. \n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits place: As calculated, 49. \n\nTens place: 50. \n\nHundreds place: 89. \n\nTotal: 49+50+89=188. \n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place:49. \n\nTens place:49. \n\nHundreds place:0. \n\nTotal:98. \n\nDifference:188-98=90. \n\nYes, that seems consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different counting method to verify. \n\nAnother way is to consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. \n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is given by:\n\ncount_units = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nBut wait, actually, for each digit d, the count is (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0). \n\nWait, let me think. For units digit, the count is how many times d appears in the units place from 1 to n. \n\nIt's equal to (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0). \n\nSo for d=4, n=488:\n\ncount_units_4 = (488 // 10) * 1 + (1 if (488 % 10) >=4 else 0) = 48 *1 + (1 if 8 >=4 else 0) =48+1=49. \n\nSimilarly for d=8:\n\ncount_units_8 =48 + (1 if 8 >=8 else 0)=48+1=49. \n\nSo units place is correct. \n\nFor the tens place:\n\nThe formula for the tens digit is a bit more involved. The count of digit d in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount_tens = (n // 100) * 10 + ( (n % 100) // 10 >= d ? (n % 100) // 10 - d +1 : 0 )\n\nWait, perhaps better to think in terms of full groups and partial groups. \n\nFor the tens place, each full hundred contributes 10 times for each digit 0-9. So, from 1-488, the number of full hundreds is 4 (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each contributes 10 times for 4 and 8 in the tens place. So 4*10=40 for each digit. \n\nThen, from 400-488, which is the partial hundred. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). \n\nFor the tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So 10 times. \n\nFor the tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 9 times. \n\nSo total for 4 in tens place:40+10=50. \n\nFor 8 in tens place:40+9=49. \n\nThat's consistent with my earlier calculation. \n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So 89 times for 4, and 0 for 8. \n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think this confirms that the difference is indeed 90. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems like a lot, but considering that 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times, which is a significant contribution, it makes sense. So, I think my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and an extra 8 numbers. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), does the units digit reach 4? Yes, 484 is within this range, so that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a range of 10 numbers every 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Let's see how many such ranges are there up to 488. From 1-100, there's one range (40-49). From 101-200, another (140-149). Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349. Then, in 400-488, we have 440-449. So that's a total of 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 4's.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), does the units digit reach 8? Yes, 488 is in this range, so that's one more 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these. From 1-400, there are four such ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in 400-488, the next range would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers. So, adding that, we have 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me double-check. From 1-400, yes, four ranges each of 10 numbers, so 40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me recount the tens place. From 1-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four sets, each contributing 10 8's, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when counting 4's, I had 188, and 8's are 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1-488, how many 4's in units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units place, so that's one more, making 49. That's correct.\n\nFor 4's in tens place: ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's, units place: same as 4's, 49. Tens place: 49. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 8's. From 1-400, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four ranges, each 10 numbers, so 40. Then, in 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when I add units and tens for 8's, it's 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check if in the hundreds place for 8's, there are any numbers. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 or lower, so no 8's in hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position separately.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 10) + 1 if the remainder is >=4. 488 /10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Since 48*10=480, and 484 is within 480-488, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: same logic, 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 100) *10 + min(10, (488 % 100) -40 +1). Wait, maybe a better way.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times a digit appears in the tens place can be calculated as follows: for each hundred, the digit appears 10 times. So, for 4 in the tens place, how many hundreds are there? Up to 488, so 0-488. So, 0-99: 40-49 (10 times). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10. So, total 5 ranges \u00d710=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: 0-99:80-89 (10). 100-199:180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488 (9). So, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nNumber of 8's: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 numbers? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial block from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. The number of times the units digit is 4 is equal to the number of complete tens plus any extra in the incomplete tens. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's the floor of 488 divided by 10, which is 48, plus one if the last number is 484, which it is. So yes, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Wait, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is 440-449, which is a full 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks (each hundred) times 10, but wait, actually, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds plus the 488. But in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 times 10 is 40, but wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's an additional 10. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d710=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, total tens place 4's are 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but wait, the hundreds digit is only relevant for three-digit numbers, which start at 100. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as above. So, hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nNow, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99+89=188? Wait, 99+89 is actually 188, yes. But let me check again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (each contributing one 4) plus one in the last partial ten (484), so 49.\n\n- Tens place: 5 sets of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4, it's the number of times the units digit is 8. So, from 1 to 488, it's floor(488/10)=48 full tens, each contributing one 8, plus one more if the last number is 488, which it is. So, 48+1=49.\n\nWait, but 488 ends with 8, so yes, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's similar to 4. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's each, so 4\u00d710=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 40+9=49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10 numbers, 8's in tens place:10.\n\n180-189:10.\n\n280-289:10.\n\n380-389:10.\n\n480-488:9.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49 (correct because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, plus one more at 484).\n\n- Tens: 50 (5 ranges, each 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488 inclusive).\n\nTotal: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49 (same logic as 4's).\n\n- Tens: 49 (four full tens ranges and one partial with 9 numbers).\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each position for both 4 and 8 and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each group of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once as well (8, 18, 28, etc.). So, for 48 complete groups, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48, and the same for 8's. Now, looking at the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial group, the digit 4 appears once (484), and the digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. \n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, from 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49), and similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89). So, for each hundred, 4 and 8 each contribute 10 occurrences in the tens place. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. But here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 because 488 is less than 500. \n\nWait, actually, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, for the tens place in 401-488, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (440-449), but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (480-489), but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 = 50, and the number of 8's is 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit being 4, the pages are 440-449, which is 10 pages. For the tens digit being 8, the pages are 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 10 for 4 and 9 for 8. So, total tens place counts: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place for 100 numbers each, except for the last one, which is only up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, and 4 for 300-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 300-488, which is 189 numbers (since 488 - 300 + 1 = 189). \n\nNow, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? For the hundreds digit being 4, which is from 400-488, that's 89 numbers (400-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this book, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0. \n\nSo, summing up the hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's total up all the occurrences. \n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 times each digit. So, four hundreds give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, 40 +9=49 for 8's. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nAdding them up: 49+50+89=188 for 4's, and 49+49+0=98 for 8's. Difference is 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - The last 8 numbers (481-488) add one more '4' (484) and one more '8' (488).\n   - Total: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Four complete hundreds contribute 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - From 401-488, '4' appears 10 times (440-449) and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. \n\nStarting with the units place. For numbers from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then adjusting for any remainder.\n\nWait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which isn't a whole number. So, I think I should take the integer part, which is 48, and then check if there are any additional numbers beyond that. Let me see: 48*10 is 480, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 complete sets of 10. Then, from 481 to 488, there are 8 more numbers. \n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 (from the complete sets) plus 1 if 484 is within the range. Wait, 484 is less than 488, so yes, 484 would add another 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: 48 complete sets give 48 eights, and then from 481 to 488, the numbers ending with 8 would be 488. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems equal. So, so far, 49 each. So, the difference so far is zero. Hmm, let's move on to the tens place.\n\nFor the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit in the tens place cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 10, and the same for 8. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, looking at the incomplete hundred from 401 to 488. The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this incomplete hundred.\n\nWait, but wait, 480 is included in 401-488, right? So, 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in the incomplete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 4's are 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50. 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49, so 4's are one more here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers from 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's zero. From 100 onwards, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can only be up to 4, since 488 is less than 500. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total for hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. So, 4's are 89 more here.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n\nAdding them up:\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 49 + 49 is 98, but 188 - 98 is 90, which seems a big difference. Wait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, I said 4 appears 89 times because pages 400-488 are 89 pages. Let me check that: 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 + 1 = 89. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for the incomplete hundred, I said 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, I had 49 each, which seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I add up, I get 4's as 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 484 is one more 4, and 488 is one more 8. So, units: 4's = 48 +1=49, 8's=48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place: Each complete hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10=40 for each. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, 440-449 is 10 pages with 4 in the tens place, and 480-488 is 9 pages with 8 in the tens place. So, tens place: 4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+9=49. That's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8's here are 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the 8's, in the hundreds place, there are none because 800 would be beyond 488. So, 0.\n\nIn the tens place, in the incomplete hundred, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. So, 9 8's there.\n\nIn the units place, 488 is included, so 8 appears once more in the units place beyond the 48 complete sets.\n\nWait, so 48 sets of 10 pages give 48 8's in the units place, plus 488, which is another 8, making 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place, 48 sets give 48, plus 484, which is another 4, making 49.\n\nSo, the counts seem accurate. So, the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the total number of digits to make sure I'm not overcounting. Wait, no, because each digit is counted separately in each place. So, the total number of digits printed is more than 488, but the count of each digit is correct as per their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Let me try to calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: For every 10 numbers, one 4. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, from 481-488, 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place, so 48 +1=49.\n\n- Tens place: For every 100 numbers, 10 numbers have 4 in the tens place. So, 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 10. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, 488 is another 8 in the units place, so 48 +1=49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-488 is 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 40 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, difference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n   - 48 \u00d7 1 = 48 occurrences of 4 and 8 each.\n   - Remaining pages (481-488): 484 adds 1 more 4, and 488 adds 1 more 8.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Complete hundreds in 488 pages: 4 hundreds.\n   - 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences of 4 and 8 each.\n   - Remaining pages (401-488):\n     - 440-449: 10 occurrences of 4.\n     - 480-488: 9 occurrences of 8.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488: 89 occurrences of 4.\n   - No occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial block, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Now, how many full blocks of 100 are there in 488? There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488. Each full block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8. In each full block, that's one 8, so 48 times. In the partial block (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For every block of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each block, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks of 100, each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the partial block from 401-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's 9 more 8's. So, total 8's in tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's there.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For the tens place in the partial block, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 times, yes. So, 40 (from full blocks) + 9 = 49. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify my calculations again, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus the last partial block (481-488), where 484 has a 4 in units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems right.\n\n- Tens place: 4 full blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 40. Plus the partial block from 401-488, where the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That adds up.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus the last partial block (481-488) where 488 has an 8 in units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 full blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Plus the partial block from 401-488, where the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. In the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 full blocks (40) + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, 9 8's there. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm counting correctly for the units place. For example, in the units place, each block of 10 has exactly one 4 and one 8. So, from 1-488, how many 4's and 8's in units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, in the last partial block, which is 481-488, the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units 4's: 48 +1=49, units 8's:48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, for 4's, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? Because 440, 441, ..., 449. That's 10 numbers. So, 10 4's in the tens place. So, 40 (from full blocks) +10=50.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 (from full blocks) +9=49.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, is 480-488 inclusive 9 numbers? Let me count: 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I feel like 90 is a big number. Let me check if I'm overcounting somewhere.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately, as I did, but maybe I can think of it differently.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider each digit place separately and count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit appears can be calculated as follows.\n\nFor units place:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is equal to (N + 1) // 10 * 1 + ( (N + 1) % 10 > d ? 1 : 0 )\n\nWait, maybe that's a formula I can use.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many complete groups of 10 there are and then any remainder.\n\nSo, for units place, number of 4's is:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10 in 488: floor(488 /10)=48. Each group contributes 1 4, so 48*1=48. Then, check the remainder: 488 %10=8. Since 8 >=4, we add 1 more, so total 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:48, each contributes 1, so 48. Remainder is 8, which is equal to 8, so add 1, total 48+1=49.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place:\n\nEach complete group of 100 contributes 10 times the digit in the tens place. So, number of complete groups of 100 in 488: floor(488/100)=4. Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Now, the remainder is 88. We need to see how many times 4 appears in the tens place in the remaining 88 numbers (from 401 to 488). The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in the remaining 88 numbers, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? It's from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100:4, each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Remainder is 88. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9. So, total 40+9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's in hundreds place:\n\nEach complete group of 1000 contributes 100 times the digit in the hundreds place, but since we're only going up to 488, it's different. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89.\n\nNumber of 8's in hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place for 4's: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, I need to figure out how many such sets there are in 488 pages. \n\nFrom page 1 to 488, the number of complete sets of ten is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). But wait, actually, each set of ten contributes one 4 in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 488th page, the units digit is 8, not 4. So, the last complete set of ten ends at 480. From 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from 1 to 480) plus 1 (from 484), totaling 49. Wait, no, that can't be right because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of complete tens is 48, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the incomplete set from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but wait, from 1 to 480, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 (since 480/10=48). Then, from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, 484 is the only one with a units digit of 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 4's in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there up to 488? \n\nFrom 1-99: 40-49, that's one set, contributing 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nFrom 100-199: 140-149, another 10.\n\nFrom 200-299: 240-249, another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 340-349, another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10, but wait, 449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's five sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's five sets, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, from 400-488, the range 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, for the units place, I thought it was 49, but let me recount. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 is the only one with a units digit of 4. So, total 48+1=49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, as I thought, 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. That seems right.\n\nFor the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in every set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 is the last one, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's 48+1=49 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so yes, that's correct.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except for the last one, which might be incomplete.\n\nSo, from 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, another 10.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 480-488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9. So, total 49.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when counting the 4's in the units place, I got 49, and in the tens place 50, and in the hundreds place 89, totaling 188. For 8's, units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds 0, totaling 98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nBut let me think again: when counting the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there are none, so 0.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, for 8's, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in the units place, 8's: from 1-488, every 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the last partial set (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's 48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place, it's 48 full tens, plus 484, so 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the 4's in the tens place, I considered 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, I have 4 sets of 10: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised that the difference is 90. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately, then sum them up.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit is >=4, which it is (488 ends with 8, which is >=4), so 48+1=49.\n\nWait, no, actually, the formula is a bit different. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor(N/10)*1 + min(max(N%10 - d +1, 0),10). So, for 4's in units place up to 488:\n\nfloor(488/10)=48, and 488%10=8. So, 8-4+1=5. So, the number of 4's in units place is 48*1 +5=53? Wait, that contradicts my earlier count.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misapplying the formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is:\n\nIf N is, say, ABC (a three-digit number), then the number of times d appears in the units place is:\n\nA*100 + B*10 + C.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of how many complete groups of 10 there are, and then how many in the remaining.\n\nSo, for 488, the number of complete tens is 48 (since 48*10=480). Each complete ten contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48.\n\nThen, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), how many have 4 in the units place? Only 484, so one more. So, total 48+1=49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\nNumber of complete tens:48, each contributing one 8, so 48.\n\nIn the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place, so one more. So, 48+1=49.\n\nWait, but using the formula I thought earlier, for 4's in units place up to N=488:\n\nNumber of 4's = (488 // 10) + 1 if 4 <= (488 % 10). So, 48 + 1=49, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\nNumber of 8's = (488 // 10) + 1 if 8 <= (488 % 10). Since 488%10=8, which is equal to 8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, for the tens place:\n\nFor 4's in tens place:\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, up to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 (since 400 is the start of the hundreds). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times the tens digit cycles through 0-9.\n\nWait, the number of times the tens digit is 4 is equal to the number of complete hundreds times 10, plus the number in the incomplete hundred if applicable.\n\nSo, up to 488, the number of complete hundreds is 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the incomplete hundred from 401-488, how many numbers have tens digit 4? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Since 449 is less than 488, that's 10 numbers. So, total 40+10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, up to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the incomplete hundred from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nFor 4's, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89 4's.\n\nFor 8's, the hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no such numbers. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the difference would be smaller, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, let me check the counts again.\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:50\n\n- Hundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:49\n\n- Hundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each position in the page numbers separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers, so that's 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. Each full group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so no additional 4's there. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for every group of 100 numbers. Specifically, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. Wait, but in the case of 440-449, that's within the 400-488 range. So, how many such groups are there? Let's see: 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units place (48) + Tens place (50) + Hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in every group of 10, the digit 8 appears once. From 1 to 488, that's 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 8's. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the number 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every group of 100 numbers. Specifically, in each hundred, it's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many groups? From 1-99: 80-89 (10), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), and 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full groups of 10 and one partial group of 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 to 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units place (49) + Tens place (49) + Hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. \n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's, units place: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's, units: 49, tens: 49, total 98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems right. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (once every 10 numbers, 48 full groups of 10).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (10 per each of the 5 hundred groups).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 from full groups, plus 1 in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (10 in each of the first four hundreds, plus 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 fours and 48 eights. Now, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding those, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's appear the same number of times. \n\nWait, but I should check if 488 is included correctly. 488 is the last page, so yes, units digit 8 appears once more. So, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digits go from 0 to 9 ten times each (for each hundred). So, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages, and the same for 8. \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, which means there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 4 times 10, which is 40 fours. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 times 10 is 40 eights. \n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Let's break this down. The tens digits go from 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). \n\nWait, but 488 is the end, so the tens digit in 480-488 is 8. Now, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Let's see: 440-449 would be the tens digit 4, which is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, right? Wait, no, 440 is within 401-488, so that's 10 fours in the tens place. So, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the incomplete hundred.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which might be less. Wait, no, actually, 401-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digits from 0 to 8 each appear 10 times except for the last one, which is only 9 times because 488 is the end. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 numbers.\n410-419: tens digit 1, 10 numbers.\n...\n480-489: tens digit 8, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488).\n\nSo, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). Therefore, in the incomplete hundred, 4's in the tens place: 10, and 8's in the tens place: 9.\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n4's: 4 complete hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the incomplete hundred, so total 50 fours.\n8's: 4 complete hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the incomplete hundred, so total 49 eights.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, we have 50 fours and 49 eights. So, the fours have 1 more in the tens place than the eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case because the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit cycles as follows:\n\n1: 1-99 (no hundreds digit, so hundreds digit is 0, but we can consider it as 0)\n2: 100-199\n3: 200-299\n4: 300-399\n5: 400-488 (but wait, 400-488 is part of the hundreds digit 4, so 400-488 is 89 pages, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them.)\n\nWait, no, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, each hundreds digit from 1 to 3 appears 100 times each, and the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times (since 400-488 is 89 pages). Wait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? Only in the 400-488 range, which is 89 times. How about 8? Well, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, so the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is zero.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n4's: 89\n8's: 0\n\nSo, now, let's sum up all the digits.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 49\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each, then the last 8 numbers (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488), so units place: 49 each.\n\nIn the tens place, for each complete hundred, 10 fours and 10 eights. So, 4 complete hundreds give 40 fours and 40 eights. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, tens place: 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit for 400-488 is 4, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. That's correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nAnother check: total number of digits. Let me see if the total number of digits makes sense. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can recount each digit place.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for the incomplete hundred, I had 401-488. The tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 9 times because 488 is the end. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times (440-449), which is correct. For 8 in the tens place, it's 9 times (480-488). So, that seems right.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 49 each.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so there are 90 more 4's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 complete blocks: 48 fours, 48 eights.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488): one 4 (484), one 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights.\n   - 4 complete hundreds: 40 fours, 40 eights.\n   - Remaining 88 numbers (401-488):\n     - 440-449: 10 fours.\n     - 480-488: 9 eights.\n   - Total: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488: 89 fours.\n   - No 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of 10 consecutive numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit appears once in the units place. So, to find the total number of 4's in the units place, I can calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages and then see how many 4's are in each block.\n\nWait, but actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, for each complete block of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 blocks would give 48 fours. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's no 4 in the units place here. So, total 4's in units place would be 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, each block of 10 has exactly one 8. So, 48 blocks give 48 eights. Then, in the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the units digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 8's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so the last number is 488, which is part of the 488th page. So, the last partial block is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers: 481,482,...,488. So, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 8 appears once in the units place at 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 (from complete blocks) +1 (from last partial block) =49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 numbers.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo, for the tens place, 4 appears 10 times per hundred. There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, we need to check the partial hundred from 401-488. In this range, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 480-488). Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for each ten's digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\nEach ten's digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times, except the last one, which might be less if the range doesn't complete the full 10 numbers.\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let's see: from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). For each ten's digit, there are 10 numbers except for the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9.\n\nWait, but actually, 401-410 is 10 numbers (401,402,...,410), 411-420 is another 10, and so on until 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, the ten's digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times, but wait, the ten's digit is 8 in 480-488, so that's 9 numbers where the ten's digit is 8. So, in the tens place, digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred.\n\nSimilarly, the ten's digit 4 would appear in 440-449, which is a full 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488: let's check each ten's digit.\n\n- 401-410: ten's digit 0\n- 411-420: ten's digit 1\n- 421-430: ten's digit 2\n- 431-440: ten's digit 3\n- 441-450: ten's digit 4\n- 451-460: ten's digit 5\n- 461-470: ten's digit 6\n- 471-480: ten's digit 7\n- 481-488: ten's digit 8\n\nWait, but 480 is part of 480-488, which is ten's digit 8. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the ten's digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, 441-450 is ten's digit 4, which is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred (401-488):\n\n- Number of 4's in tens place: 10\n- Number of 8's in tens place: 9\n\nTherefore, total in tens place:\n\n- 4's: 4 complete hundreds *10 =40 + partial hundred 10 =50\n- 8's: 4 complete hundreds *10=40 + partial hundred 9=49\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, total 4's in tens place:50, 8's:49.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check. The partial hundred is 401-488, which is 88 numbers. The ten's digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is 8, appearing 9 times. So, for 4's in the tens place, it's 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8's, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, yes, 50 fours and 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds digit, each page number from 1-99 has no hundreds digit, so the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore. From 100 onwards, the hundreds digit starts at 1 and goes up.\n\nIn our case, the book has up to 488 pages, so the hundreds digits can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nHow about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4 in this case. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place in this book, since the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, number of 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total in hundreds place:\n\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place:48\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:48+50+89=187\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages:488\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10:48 (since 48*10=480), so 48 blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 fours and 48 eights.\n\nThen, the last partial block:481-488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1-8, so only one 8 in the units place at 488. So, units place:4's=48, 8's=48+1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete hundred (1-100,101-200, etc.) has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4 (since 400 pages), so 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights.\n\nPartial hundred:401-488.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is 8, appearing 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: In 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n- 8's: Tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights.\n\nSo, total in tens place:4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n- 8's: None, since the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0.\n\nTotal 4's:48+50+89=187\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:187-98=89\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using a formula for digit counting.\n\nIn general, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated by considering each digit place separately, as I did.\n\nSo, for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), I calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nI think my method is correct, so the difference is 89.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. We analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4. With 48 complete blocks (480 pages), there are 48 fours. The last 8 pages (481-488) don't add any more 4's.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, 48 eights from complete blocks plus one more at 488, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Four complete hundreds give 40 fours. The partial hundred (401-488) adds another 10 fours (440-449).\n   - **8's:** Four complete hundreds give 40 eights. The partial hundred adds 9 eights (480-488), totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours.\n   - **8's:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSumming up:\n- **4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each place and calculate the occurrences of 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit appears once in the units place. \n\nBut wait, since the book ends at 488, I need to check if 488 is a multiple of 10. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last block is from 481 to 488, which is only 8 numbers. So, I need to adjust for that. \n\nLet me calculate the number of complete blocks of 10 and the partial block separately. From 1 to 480, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages. Then from 481 to 488, there are 8 more pages. \n\nFor the units place, in each complete block of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like 4,14,24,...) and the digit 8 appears once (8,18,28,...). So, for 48 complete blocks, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. \n\nNow, looking at the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in this partial block, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 +1=49. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear equally, 49 times each.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred block. \n\nAgain, since we're going up to 488, let's break it down into complete hundreds and the remaining part. \n\nFrom 1 to 400, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 times (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, it's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, from 401 to 488, which is 88 numbers. The tens digit here ranges from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Let's see. The tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, from 401 to 488, 440-449 is within that range. So, that's 10 occurrences. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is the end, so 440-449 is fully included. So, 10 times. \n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. \n\nSo, adding to the previous counts: for 4 in the tens place, 40 (from 1-400) +10 (from 401-488) =50 times. For 8 in the tens place, 40 (from 1-400) +9 (from 401-488) =49 times. \n\nWait, let me make sure I did that right. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 4 occurs 10 times and 8 occurs 9 times in the tens place for 401-488. \n\nSo, total for tens place: 4 occurs 50 times, 8 occurs 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, for pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which doesn't count. From 100 onwards, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. \n\nSo, let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The highest hundreds digit is 4. So, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences for each digit in all places.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times.\n\nNow for the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 for 4 and 8, plus the last block contributing 1 each. So, 48 +1=49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 for each digit, so 4 hundreds *10=40 each. Then from 401-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 for 4, and 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 for 8. So, 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+9=49 for 8. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 for 4, and 0 for 8. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 49+50+89=188 for 4, and 49+49+0=98 for 8. The difference is 90. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1=89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Each digit in the hundreds place from 1-999 appears a certain number of times, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each position, I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. \n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each complete set, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, we have those extra 8 numbers: 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so 8 appears once more in the units place (at 488). So, total units place 4's: 48, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nWait, no, actually, in the extra 8 numbers, 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 8 appears only once in the units place (at 488). So, units place 4's: 48, 8's: 49. So, the difference in units place is 48 - 49 = -1, meaning 8's are more by 1 in units place. But I need to check the other places too.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), same for 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, 10 times 4 and 10 times 8. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 for 4's and 4*10 = 40 for 8's. \n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages: 401-488. The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nFrom 401-409: tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8 here. \n\nFrom 410-419: tens digit is 1, no. \n\n420-429: tens digit is 2, no. \n\n430-439: tens digit is 3, no. \n\n440-449: tens digit is 4, so that's 10 times. \n\n450-459: tens digit is 5, no. \n\n460-469: tens digit is 6, no. \n\n470-479: tens digit is 7, no. \n\n480-488: tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 times. \n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 times. Wait, but in the tens place, each 10 numbers have the same tens digit, so 480-489 would be 10 times, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 times. So, in the tens place for 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50. \n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49. \n\nSo, difference in tens place: 50 - 49 = +1, meaning 4's are more by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. \n\nThe hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: only in pages 400-488. \n\nLet's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages, so 89 times. \n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, 0 times. \n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. \n\nDifference here is 89 - 0 = +89, so 4's are way more here.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nUnits place:\n4's: 48\n8's: 49\nDifference: -1\n\nTens place:\n4's: 50\n8's: 49\nDifference: +1\n\nHundreds place:\n4's: 89\n8's: 0\nDifference: +89\n\nTotal difference: (-1) + (+1) + (+89) = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the units place correctly. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units place? Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times, plus in the last partial set, 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so no 4 there. So, units place 4's: 48.\n\nFor 8's in units place: same as 4's, 48 times, plus in the last partial set, 488 has 8 in units, so 49 total. So yes, units place: 48 vs 49.\n\nTens place: 4's: 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (440-449) = 50. 8's: 40 (from 1-400) plus 9 (480-488) = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nSo total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, difference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Alternatively, maybe I should count each digit place separately and sum them up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again. From 1-99, hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's there. From 100-399, hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, so no 4's or 8's. From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears in hundreds place.\n\nSo yes, 89 for 4's in hundreds place, 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nUnits place: 48 vs 49.\n\nTens place: 50 vs 49.\n\nHundreds place: 89 vs 0.\n\nSo total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nSo, 4's appear 89 more times than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. But since we're only concerned with the units digit, each block contributes one 4. So, 48 times 1 is 48. But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), does the units digit include a 4? Let me check: 484 is within 481-488, so that's another 4. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times in each block. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, what about the last partial hundred, 401-488? The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's from the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place again. Every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. So, 48 * 1 = 48. Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once, at 488. So, that's another 1. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's from the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. So, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. So, 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, yes, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the units place: 48 full blocks (1-480) each contributing one 8, so 48, plus 488, which is the 489th number, so that's one more 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. Then, in the tens place, 50 4's, and units place 49 4's. 89 + 50 = 139, plus 49 is 188. That seems right.\n\nFor the 8's, units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, in the units place for 4's: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, plus one more in 484, making it 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: in each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, etc., each has 10 numbers. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 is another 10, so 40+10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full times (1-480), plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: in each hundred, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each has 10. 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9. Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: none, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, with an additional 9 in the last partial hundred, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, so 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times in the full groups and once more in the partial group (484), so that's 49 times. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so the partial group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place, 4 appears once in each group of 10, so 48 times from 1-480, and then in 484, which is the 4th number in the last partial group. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place for digit 4.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's figure out how many such blocks exist up to 488.\n\nFrom 1-99: There's one block, 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\nFrom 100-199: Another block, 140-149, another 10.\nFrom 200-299: 240-249, another 10.\nFrom 300-399: 340-349, another 10.\nFrom 400-488: Now, the block would be 440-449, but wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's another 10. \n\nSo, that's 1 (from 40-49) + 1 (140-149) + 1 (240-249) + 1 (340-349) + 1 (440-449) = 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 times in the tens place for digit 4.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places for digit 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, digit 4 appears 188 times.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many full groups of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each full group, 8 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. In the partial group, 488 is included, which ends with an 8, so that's one more. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, each full block contributes 10 times, except the last one which contributes 9 times.\n\nSo, from 1-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 times.\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, 10 times.\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, 10 times.\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, 10 times.\nFrom 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, the total for the tens place is 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Units: 49, tens: 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. That seems right.\n\nAnd for the tens place for 4's, I had 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Units place: 49.\n\nYes, that all adds up.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units and tens each have 49, so 98 total.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. Therefore, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is calculated by examining each digit place (units, tens, hundreds). \n\n- **Units place**: 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full groups of 10 and a partial group of 8, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place**: 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place**: 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- **Units place**: 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place**: 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place**: No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each complete set of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. But I need to check how many complete sets of ten there are in 488 pages.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, for the units place, in each of the 48 complete sets, both 4 and 8 appear once each. That gives 48 occurrences for 4 and 48 for 8 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding that, units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's. Wait, but 48 complete sets plus 1 more in the partial set, so 48 + 1 = 49 for each. Hmm, but let me check that again. Wait, no, because the first page is 1, so the first set is 1-10, which includes 10. So, 488 pages would have 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490?), but wait, 488 is less than 490, so the last set is 481-488, which is only 8 pages, not a full ten. So, in the units place, each full decade contributes one 4 and one 8, so 48 decades give 48 each. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the units digit is 4 once (484) and 8 once (488). So, units place: 48 +1 = 49 4's and 48 +1 = 49 8's. So, units place contributes equally to both digits, so no difference there.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, in 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) and then 1-9 each for ten numbers. So, for each digit in the tens place, it appears 10 times per hundred. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in 40-49, which is 10 pages. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in 80-89. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, that's 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's in the tens place from the first four hundreds. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, 401-409: the tens digit is 0, so 401-409 doesn't have 4 in the tens place. Then 410-419: tens digit is 1, 420-429: tens digit is 2, ..., up to 480-488. Wait, so in 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but we're looking for when the tens digit is 4. So, 440-449 would have the tens digit as 4. How many pages are there from 440-449? That's 10 pages: 440-449. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 440-449. So, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 480 is the start, and 488 is the end. So, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, and there are 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred. So, for the tens place, total 4's: 40 (from first four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Total 8's: 40 (from first four hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49, so 4's are one more than 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8, on the other hand, never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0. Therefore, in the hundreds place, 4's contribute 89 and 8's contribute 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each position.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in units place. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 48 +1 = 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- For each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times in 440-449, and 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +9=49 for 8's. That looks correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488). 8 never appears in hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (the first digit from the right):**\n   - For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. \n   - To find how many such blocks there are in 488 pages, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a block, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. So, that's 48 times 4 appears in the units place.\n   - But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last block is 480-488. In this block, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, meaning the 48th block does have a 4 in the units place. So, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place (the second digit from the right):**\n   - For every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 instances of 4 in the tens place.\n   - How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's divide 488 by 100, which gives 4.88. Taking the integer part, that's 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, the fifth block is 401-488. In this block, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so another 10 times. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (the third digit from the right):**\n   - The hundreds place is only relevant for three-digit numbers, which start from 100. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many times does 4 appear here?\n   - From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, contributing 89 instances of 4.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so that's correct. Tens place: 40 from the first four blocks, and 10 from 440-449, totaling 50. Units place: 48 times. So 48+50+89=187. Hmm, maybe that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every block of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 blocks, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every block of 100 numbers has 10 instances where the tens digit is 8. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - The fifth block is 401-488. In this block, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 instances of 8 in the tens place.\n   - So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't overcount somewhere. Let me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 187.\n\nAnd 8's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 49\nTotal: 97.\n\nSo 187 - 97 = 90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I overcounted in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 is correct. Tens place: 40 from the first four blocks, and 10 from 440-449, which is correct. Units place: 48. So 187 total 4's.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48, correct. Tens place: 40 from first four blocks, and in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49. So 97 total 8's.\n\nSo the difference is 187 - 97 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, another way to check: maybe using a formula. The number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated using a method where you consider each digit place separately, as I did. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small program or use a different method to verify, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll stick with my calculation.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - For every 10 pages, 4 appears once (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).  \n   - Total 4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - For every 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   - Full hundreds: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - In 401-488, 440-449 adds another 10.  \n   - Total 4's in tens place: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).  \n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 pages.  \n   - Total blocks of 10: 48.  \n   - Total 8's in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - For every 100 pages, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489).  \n   - Full hundreds: 4, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - In 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 (since 489 is beyond 488).  \n   - Total 8's in tens place: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No 8's since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **97**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many groups of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each group of ten, the units digit is 4 exactly once, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit is 4 only once (484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're dealing with three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit for 40-49 is 0 (i.e., 040-049, but since we're starting from 1, it's 40-49). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times for the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 times. \n\nWait, but hold on, when counting the hundreds place, do I need to consider if the hundreds digit is 4? Yes, because that's the hundreds place. So, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every group of ten numbers has one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, that's 48 full groups of ten (480 numbers) plus 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each group, units digit 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the last partial group, 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Each of the other ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers. So, how many ranges? From 0 to 4 in the hundreds place, but the last one is cut short. So, 80-89 is one, 180-189 is two, 280-289 is three, 380-389 is four, and 480-488 is five. Each of the first four contributes 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. The ranges are 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full ranges and one partial. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when counting 4's, I had 49 units, 50 tens, and 89 hundreds, totaling 188. For 8's, it's 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds, totaling 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4's, we had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups of ten, each contributing one 4, plus one more in the last partial group, so 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 8's, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 9 numbers. So, 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) with 10 each, and one partial with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's, in the hundreds place, it's 89 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the 4's in the units place, I have 48 full groups of ten, each contributing one 4, and then in the last group (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately because each digit position can have 4's and 8's independently. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times 1 for 4's and 48 times 1 for 8's. So, units place contributes 48 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, the partial block from 481 to 488. Let's list the units digits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in the units place here, we have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, the partial block adds 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWait, so so far, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal. Hmm, maybe the difference comes from the tens and hundreds places.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89).\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and an additional 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens place contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 4's and 4*10 = 40 8's.\n\nNow, the partial hundred from 401 to 488. Let's look at the tens digit here. The pages are 401-488, so the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, actually, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: tens digit is 1, and so on up to 480-488: tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It appears in the tens digit when the tens digit is 4, which is pages 440-449. That's 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears when the tens digit is 8, which is pages 480-488. But wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is included, so 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Pages 480 to 488: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 in all these, so 9 times. So, in the tens place for the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, adding this to the full hundreds: total 4's in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49\n\nWait, that can't be right because 4*10 is 40 from the full hundreds, and then 10 from the partial, so 50. For 8's, 4*10 is 40, plus 9 from the partial, so 49. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49, so 4's have 1 more here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 49\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for the partial hundred (401-488), I thought that 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). Let me confirm that.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 times 4 in the tens place. When the tens digit is 8, that's pages 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, 9 times 8 in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188\n\n8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should recount each digit place.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place: For every 10 pages, once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: same logic, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and in the last 8 pages, 488 has a units digit of 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place.\n\nThere are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4's and 8's.\n\nNow, the partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn this range, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's. When the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred, 10 4's and 9 8's.\n\nThus, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so no 4's or 8's here.\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nNo 8's in hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nSo, I think that's correct. There are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and a partial block of 8 pages (481-488).\n   - 4's: 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49\n   - 8's: 48 + 1 (from 488) = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (400 pages) contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The partial hundred (401-488) contributes 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n   - 4's: 89\n   - 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set from 481 to 488, the units digit goes up to 8, so the number 484 will have a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more 4. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many complete sets of 100 are there in 488? There are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each set contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488) have the tens digit in the 400s. From 401-409, the tens digit is 0, but from 410-419, it's 1, and so on. Wait, no, actually, in the 400s, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more, making it 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For every 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 complete sets of 100, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 more 8's. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 4's. The last partial set (481-488) adds 1 more, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** For every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times. Four complete sets contribute 40. In the 400s, 440-449 adds 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** For every 100, 8 appears 10 times. Four sets contribute 40. In the 400s, 480-488 adds 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nFirst, let's find out how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, there are 48 complete blocks and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete block of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. \n\nNow, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (484), and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each digit in the tens place, it appears 10 times per 100 numbers. \n\nLet me see, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 numbers (401-488). \n\nIn each complete block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 blocks, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and similarly, 8's are also 40. \n\nNow, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear here. \n\nLooking at the range 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. \n\nSo, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, but wait, in the range 401-488, the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. However, since our upper limit is 488, we need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. Yes, 440 is greater than 401, and 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 numbers. \n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 in the tens place appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 numbers. \n\nWait, let me check that again. The tens digit 8 in 401-488 would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. \n\nTherefore, in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nAdding this to the complete blocks, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from blocks) + 10 (from remaining) = 50. The total number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from blocks) + 9 (from remaining) = 49. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. \n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for numbers 100 and above. Since our book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nLet's consider each hundred block:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nSo, the digit 4 in the hundreds place appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 in the hundreds place never appears because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, earlier when calculating the units place, I thought both 4 and 8 appeared 49 times each, but let me confirm.\n\nWait, no, actually, for the units place, I had 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 to both 4 and 8, so 48 each. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place for 4: 48 +1=49, and same for 8: 48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place, in the complete blocks of 100, each contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4 and 8 each get 10 per block. So, 4 blocks give 40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place for 4: 40 +10=50, and for 8: 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears there. So, 4's total is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's total is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98. \n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit for 4 is from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to think about how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach, like counting for each digit place separately, considering all numbers up to 488.\n\nBut I think my initial approach is correct. Let me try another way to cross-verify.\n\nFor the units digit: as before, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So, units: 49 each.\n\nFor the tens digit: Each hundred block has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 blocks (1-400) give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0-8. For the digit 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, tens place: 4: 40+10=50, 8:40+9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds digit: Only 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8.\n   - 48 complete blocks (1-480) give 48 each.\n   - The last 8 numbers (481-488) add 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete blocks (1-400) give 40 each.\n   - From 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Only numbers 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSumming up:\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each position for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and an extra 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for the digit 8. So, for 48 complete groups, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial group, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, which is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is included, so maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the extra numbers after 480 are 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. So, the units digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, yes, the 4's in the units place are 48 (from the complete groups) plus 1, totaling 49. Similarly, 8's in the units place are 48 plus 1, totaling 49. So, the units place contributes 49 of each.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), and so on up to 9 (90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.), and the same for the digit 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 for each digit. Now, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, I need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 numbers (440-449). But wait, 440 is beyond 488? No, wait, 401-488 is up to 488, so 440-449 is within that range. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the extra 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the extra 88 pages. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 = 50, and the total number of 8's is 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For the tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 10 for 4 and 9 for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each complete hundred contributes 10 for each digit, so 4 hundreds would be 40 each. Then, in the extra 88 pages, 4 contributes 10, and 8 contributes 9. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's zero. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The hundreds digits go up to 4. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the count for 8 in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit position.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- For 488 pages, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each complete group, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so 48 each. In the extra 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 48+1=49 for both. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each complete hundred (1-100, etc.) contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+9=49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the extra 88 pages. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But 440 is within 401-488, right? Yes, because 440 is less than 488. Similarly, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that part is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about the tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in 400-499, the tens digit 4 would appear 10 times (440-449), and 8 would appear 10 times (480-489). But since our book ends at 488, the 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times instead of 10. So, that's why in the extra 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are accurate. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 * 1 = 48 for both 4 and 8.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 10 * 4 = 40 for both 4 and 8.\n   - In 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll analyze each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each set of ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and similarly, the digit 8 appears once. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of ten, and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). \n\nIn each of these 48 complete sets, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Similarly, the units digit 8 appears 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the digit 4 appears once (at 484), and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nNow, let's figure out how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488. \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4's. Similarly, 4 * 10 = 40 times for 8's. \n\nNow, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear here? Let's see, the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is greater than 400 and less than 488. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in the partial hundred. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial hundred. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409, but 400 is included in the partial hundred as 401-409 would have tens digit 0, but 400 is actually page 400, which is the last page of the previous hundred. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: the partial hundred starts at 401, so the first set is 401-410, where the tens digit is 0, then 411-420, tens digit 1, and so on up to 480-488, which is the last set with tens digit 8. So, in this partial hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, as 440 is included. Similarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from the four complete hundreds) + 10 (from the partial hundred) = 50 times. The total number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from the four complete hundreds) + 9 (from the partial hundred) = 49 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the first four hundreds, each has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in the partial hundred, 4's in tens place occur 10 times, and 8's occur 9 times. So, the total for 4's is 40+10=50, and for 8's, it's 40+9=49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The hundreds digits go up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting with the units place, I had 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each, plus the last 8 pages contributing one more 4 and one more 8, so 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each complete hundred, 10 times each for 4 and 8. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred, 440-449 gives 10 times for 4, and 480-488 gives 9 times for 8. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. That adds up.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488), and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, that's correct.\n\nAdding up, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 for 4's.\n\nFor 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems right because each of those pages has a hundreds digit of 4.\n\nWait, but let me recount the hundreds place: pages 400-488 inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nIn the tens place, in the partial hundred, I considered that 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 times for 4's in the tens place. That's correct because 440 to 449 is 10 numbers. Similarly, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 9 times for 8's in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the units place, I think that's correct as well because in each set of ten, 4 and 8 each appear once, and in the last partial set, they each appear once.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I'm counting the tens place in the partial hundred, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but 480 is included in the partial hundred. Wait, 480 is page 480, which is part of 401-488, so that's correct. So, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times for 8's in the tens place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as each hundred contributing 10 times for 4's and 10 times for 8's in the tens place, except the last partial hundred where 8's in the tens place are only 9 times.\n\nWait, but in the partial hundred, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times for 8's in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check: maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's in each place separately.\n\nLet me try that approach again.\n\nUnits place:\n- Total numbers: 488.\n- Each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial set.\n- For units digit 4: how many times does it appear? It's once every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, plus in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n- Similarly, units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 times, plus once in the last partial set (at 488), so 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred.\n- For the first 400 pages (1-400), there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 each.\n- Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in this range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n- So, total for tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n- So, digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- Digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488.\n\nAdding them up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I count the hundreds place, I'm including pages 400-488, which is correct because each of those pages has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the hundreds digit being 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try another approach. Maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's in each position again, but more carefully.\n\nUnits place:\n- For each digit from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers.\n- Number of complete cycles: floor(488 / 10) = 48 cycles.\n- In each cycle, 4 appears once, so 48 times.\n- The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once more.\n- Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Similarly, 8 appears once in each cycle, so 48 times, plus once in the remaining numbers, so 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n- For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each.\n- Number of complete hundreds: 4 (1-100, 101-200, etc.)\n- Each complete hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 each.\n- Now, the partial hundred from 401-488: let's see, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488).\n- In this partial hundred, 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 times.\n- 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 times.\n- So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we find that the digit 4 appears 188 times and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering single-digit page numbers. These are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, which is on page 4. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once on page 8. So, in single-digit pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, the count so far is 4:1, 8:1. \n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each of these places.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 1 through 9. So, for the tens digit being 4, the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 80-89, which is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens group. So, in each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 sets (from 10-19 up to 90-99), the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 10-19, the units digits go from 0-9, so 4 appears once, and same for each subsequent ten. So, for each of the 9 tens groups, 4 appears once in the units place, so 9 times total. Same for 8. So, in two-digit numbers, the units place contributes 9 to both 4 and 8 counts.\n\nPutting it together for two-digit numbers: Tens place gives 10 for 4 and 10 for 8, and units place gives 9 for both. So, total for two-digit numbers: 4 appears 10 + 9 = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 + 9 = 19 times.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 4 and 8 are appearing the same number of times in two-digit pages. So, in two-digit pages, 4 and 8 each appear 19 times. So, adding that to the single-digit counts: 4:1 + 19 = 20, and 8:1 + 19 = 20. So, so far, 4 and 8 are tied at 20 each.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which go from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number has hundreds, tens, and units digits. I need to consider each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, from 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest hundreds digit is 4.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundreds group. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), I need to find how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nStarting with the hundreds group 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9, each appearing 10 times (e.g., 100-109, 110-119, etc.). So, for the tens digit being 4, there are 10 numbers (140-149), so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for 8, it's 10 times in 180-189.\n\nSame goes for 200-299: Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (240-249), and 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\nSimilarly, for 300-399: Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (340-349), and 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\nNow, for the 400-488 range: The tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, for tens digit 4, the numbers would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times. For tens digit 8, the numbers would be 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, let me confirm that: From 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, for tens digit 8, the numbers are 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the 400-488 group.\n\nSo, adding up the tens place across all hundreds groups:\n\n- 100-199: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times\n- 200-299: same, 10 each\n- 300-399: same, 10 each\n- 400-488: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times\n\nSo, total for tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times\n8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times\n\nWait, that seems correct because in the 400-488 group, 8's in tens place only have 9 numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, for each hundreds group, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens group.\n\nLet's go through each hundreds group:\n\n1. 100-199: For each tens group (100-109, 110-119, ..., 190-199), the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each tens group, 4 appears once in the units place (like 104, 114, etc.) and 8 appears once (like 108, 118, etc.). There are 10 tens groups (0-9), so for each hundreds group, 4 appears 10 times in the units place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSo, 100-199: units place contributes 10 to 4's and 10 to 8's.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: same as above, 10 each.\n\n300-399: same, 10 each.\n\n400-488: Now, this is a bit different because the last page is 488, so the units digit goes up to 8 in the last tens group (480-488). So, let's see:\n\nIn 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? For each tens group (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488), the units digit cycles 0-9 except for the last group which goes up to 8.\n\nSo, for each complete tens group (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479), there are 10 numbers, so 4 appears once in the units place in each, totaling 8 times (since there are 8 complete tens groups: 400-409 up to 470-479). Then, in 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total for 4 in units place in 400-488 is 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place in 400-488: For each complete tens group, 8 appears once (like 408, 418, etc.), so 8 times, and in 480-488, 8 appears once at 488. So, total 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait: 480-488 has units digits from 0-8, so 8 appears at 488, which is one time. So, yes, 8 appears 9 times in the units place in 400-488.\n\nSo, putting it together for the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10 each\n- 200-299: 10 each\n- 300-399: 10 each\n- 400-488: 9 each\n\nSo, total units place contributions:\n\n4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place across all three-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times each.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the occurrences for 4 and 8 in three-digit numbers.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\nTens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\nUnits place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nWait, let me check that math again:\n\n89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129, plus 39 units is 168. That's correct for 4's.\n\nFor 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78. Correct.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit pages.\n\nFrom single-digit:\n4: 1\n8: 1\n\nFrom two-digit:\n4: 19\n8: 19\n\nFrom three-digit:\n4: 168\n8: 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, single-digit: correct, 1 each.\n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 each. Correct.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. Correct, since 400-488 is 89 pages.\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times. Let me verify:\n\nIn each of the first three hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), 4 appears 10 times each in tens place, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, 4 appears 10 times in tens place (440-449). So total 30 + 10 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor 8 in tens place: 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So total 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nUnits place:\n\nIn each of the first three hundreds groups, 4 appears 10 times each in units place, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, 4 appears 9 times in units place. So total 30 +9=39. Correct.\n\nSame for 8 in units place: 3*10=30 in first three groups, and 9 in 400-488, total 39. Correct.\n\nSo, three-digit counts:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nTotal across all pages:\n\n4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 1 +19=20 +168=188\n8's: 1 +19 +78=98\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the three-digit numbers, especially in the units place for 400-488. I had 9 occurrences for 4 and 9 for 8. Let me confirm:\n\nIn 400-488, for each tens group, like 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach complete tens group (like 400-409) has 10 numbers, so 4 appears once in units place (404). There are 8 complete tens groups from 400-409 up to 470-479, so 8 times. Then, in 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is present, which is one more. So, total 9 times.

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each place for both 4 and 8 and sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's. I'll go through each position one by one.\n\n1. Units place:\n   - In the units place, the digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups and 8 extra numbers.\n   - In each group of 10 (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.).\n   - So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from each group) plus 1 if the remainder includes a 4. Wait, the remainder is 8, so the last group is 481-488. The units digits here go up to 8, so 484 is within this range. So, that's one more 4 in the units place.\n   - So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - Similarly, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n   - How many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 400 is the last complete hundred before 488. So, we have 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, we need to adjust.\n   - Wait, actually, let's think differently. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - How many hundreds are there? 400 is the 4th hundred. But since we're only going up to 488, the last hundred is 400-488.\n   - So, from 1-399, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) has 10 occurrences. So, 4 hundreds would have 4*10 = 40. But wait, up to 399, it's 4 hundreds? Wait, no, 1-100 is the first hundred, 101-200 the second, 201-300 the third, and 301-400 the fourth. So, up to 400, it's four hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n   - Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, but since we're starting at 401, the tens digit is 0 in 401-409, then 1 in 410-419, etc. Wait, no, 401-410 would have tens digits from 0 to 1, but actually, 401-410 is tens digit 0 for 401-410? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that in each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, up to 400, we have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, totaling 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, does 4 appear again? Let's see: 440-449 would be in the 400s, but 440-449 is part of 400-488. So, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 more. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-400, we have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers. So, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in 401-488, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. Therefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. Units place:\n   - Similar to 4's, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48*1=48. Now, check the remainder: 481-488. The units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, does 488 contribute an 8 in the units place? Yes, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - In the tens place, 8 appears in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n   - How many complete hundreds are there in 488? Up to 400, there are 4 hundreds. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n   - Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n   - So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units, so +1. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last partial group, 488 has an 8, so +1. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once (on page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (on page 8). So, for single-digit pages, the count is 1 for 4 and 1 for 8. The difference here is zero. \n\nNext, I'll look at the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I'll need to count the number of 4's and 8's in both places separately. \n\nStarting with the tens place: The tens digit can be 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 9. For each tens digit, there are 10 possible units digits (0-9). So, for the tens place, the digit 4 will appear in the tens position for pages 40-49. That's 10 pages, so 10 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. Similarly, the digit 8 will appear in the tens place for pages 80-89, which is another 10 pages, so 10 times for 8. \n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: For each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 14, 24, etc.), and the same for 8 (e.g., 18, 28, etc.). There are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), so 9 times each for both 4 and 8 in the units place. \n\nWait, let me check that. From 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 groups of 10. So, in each group, the units digit cycles 0-9, so each digit from 0-9 appears exactly once in the units place per group. So, for 4's in the units place, that's 9 times, and same for 8's. \n\nSo, adding up the two-digit numbers: For 4's, we have 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times. For 8's, it's 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times. So, in two-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. The difference here is also zero.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number has a hundreds, tens, and units place. I'll need to consider each place separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's determine how many three-digit page numbers there are. Since the book ends at 488, the three-digit numbers start at 100 and go up to 488. That's 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 numbers. Wait, but I think it's better to break it down by hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nLet's start with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because 488 is the last page. So, pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nI need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each of the hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 only in pages 400-488. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n- For 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 would be in pages 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, etc.), each tens digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place, except possibly in the last group (400-488) where it might be cut short.\n\nLet me handle each hundreds group separately.\n\nFirst, hundreds digit 1 (pages 100-199):\n\n- For 4's in the tens place: The tens digit is 4 in pages 140-149. That's 10 pages, so 10 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n- For 8's in the tens place: The tens digit is 8 in pages 180-189. That's another 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2 (pages 200-299):\n\n- Tens digit 4: pages 240-249: 10 times.\n\n- Tens digit 8: pages 280-289: 10 times.\n\nSame for hundreds digit 3 (pages 300-399):\n\n- Tens digit 4: 340-349: 10 times.\n\n- Tens digit 8: 380-389: 10 times.\n\nNow, for hundreds digit 4 (pages 400-488):\n\n- Tens digit 4: pages 440-449. But wait, 449 is within 488, so that's 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\n- Tens digit 8: pages 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so pages 480-488. That's 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, adding up the tens place:\n\nFor 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40 times.\n\nFor 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. In hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, total for 8's in tens place is 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, considering each hundreds group.\n\nFor each hundreds group, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens group. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), in each tens group, the units digit 4 and 8 will each appear once per ten pages.\n\nLet me calculate for each hundreds group:\n\nHundreds digit 1 (100-199):\n\n- For units digit 4: In each tens group (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 10 tens groups (0-9), so 10 times for 4.\n\n- Similarly, units digit 8 appears 10 times.\n\nHundreds digit 2 (200-299):\n\n- Units digit 4: 10 times.\n\n- Units digit 8: 10 times.\n\nHundreds digit 3 (300-399):\n\n- Units digit 4: 10 times.\n\n- Units digit 8: 10 times.\n\nHundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n\n- Now, this is a bit tricky because 488 is the end. So, the units digit goes up to 8 in the last page, which is 488.\n\nSo, in 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 and 8 appear?\n\nFirst, let's find how many complete tens groups there are. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, that's 9 tens groups (0-8).\n\nIn each complete tens group (like 400-409), the units digit 4 appears once (404) and 8 appears once (408). So, for each of the first 8 tens groups (400-479), each will have 4 and 8 once in the units place, so 8 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nThen, the last tens group is 480-488. The units digits here go from 0 to 8. So, in this group, units digit 4 appears once (484) and units digit 8 appears once (488). So, that's one more each.\n\nSo, total for units digit 4 in 400-488: 8 (from 400-479) + 1 (484) = 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8: 8 (from 400-479) + 1 (488) = 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 400-479, each tens group (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) has 10 units digits, so 4 and 8 each appear once per tens group. There are 8 tens groups here (since 400-479 is 80 pages, which is 8 tens groups of 10). So, 8 times each for 4 and 8 in units place.\n\nThen, in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480 to 488), the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, 484 and 488 are present, so 4 and 8 each appear once more. So, total units digit 4: 8 +1 =9, and same for 8.\n\nSo, in hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Units digit 4: 9 times.\n\n- Units digit 8: 9 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the units digits:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Hundreds 1: 10\n\n- Hundreds 2: 10\n\n- Hundreds 3: 10\n\n- Hundreds 4: 9\n\nTotal: 10 +10 +10 +9 = 39 times.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds 1:10\n\n- Hundreds 2:10\n\n- Hundreds 3:10\n\n- Hundreds 4:9\n\nTotal: 10+10+10+9=39 times.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 39 times each in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n\n  - 4's: 89 times.\n\n  - 8's: 0 times.\n\n- Tens place:\n\n  - 4's:40 times.\n\n  - 8's:39 times.\n\n- Units place:\n\n  - 4's:39 times.\n\n  - 8's:39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units) = 168 times.\n\n8's: 0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units) = 78 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Hundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nTens place: 4's=40, 8's=39.\n\nUnits place: 4's=39, 8's=39.\n\nSo, total 4's: 89+40+39=168.\n\nTotal 8's: 0+39+39=78.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me add up all the digits from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n- 4's:1\n\n- 8's:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- 4's:19\n\n- 8's:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- 4's:168\n\n- 8's:78\n\nSo, total 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me add again.\n\nSingle-digit: 4's=1, 8's=1.\n\nTwo-digit:4's=19, 8's=19.\n\nThree-digit:4's=168, 8's=78.\n\nSo, total 4's:1+19=20, plus 168=188.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19=20, plus 78=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nThe question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again, because 90 seems high.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the three-digit numbers. Let me go back.\n\nFirst, let's check the hundreds place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: pages 400-488. That's 488-400+1=89 pages. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1,2,3: each has tens digit 4 appearing 10 times (pages 140-149, etc.), so 3*10=30.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's:30+10=40.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 8's:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1,2,3: each has 10 times, so 3*10=30.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's:30+9=39.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10 times 4's and 10 times 8's in units place, so 3*10=30 each.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each hundreds group (100-199, etc.), the units digit 4 appears 10 times (once per tens group, 10 tens groups). Similarly for 8's. So, for hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 10 times for 4's and 10 times for 8's in the units place. So, 3*10=30 for 4's and 30 for 8's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n\n- The units digit 4 appears 9 times (as calculated earlier).\n\n- The units digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's:30+9=39.\n\nUnits digit 8's:30+9=39.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, three-digit numbers contribute:\n\n4's:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168.\n\n8's:0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units)=78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit numbers:\n\nSingle-digit:4's=1,8's=1.\n\nTwo-digit:4's=19,8's=19.\n\nSo, total 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, so the answer would be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the three-digit units place. For hundreds digit 4, units digit 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times. That seems correct because from 400-488, the units digits go up to 8 in the last page. So, in each tens group, 4 and 8 appear once, except the last tens group which only goes up to 8, so they still appear once each. So, 8 tens groups (400-479) with 8 each, and the last group (480-488) with 1 each, so 9 each. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For each hundreds group, the number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of tens groups in that hundreds group. For hundreds digit 1,2,3, each has 10 tens groups (0-9), so 10 times each digit in units place. For hundreds digit 4, there are 9 tens groups (0-8), so 9 times each digit in units place, but only up to 8. So, 4 and 8 appear once each in the units place in each tens group, so 9 times each.\n\nWait, but in the case of hundreds digit 4, the tens groups are 0-8, so 9 tens groups, each contributing once for 4 and once for 8 in the units place, so 9 each. That's correct.\n\nSo, the total counts seem accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once.\n   - 8 appears once.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94), 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - Total for two-digit pages: 19 times each for 4 and 8.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 40 times (140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), 8 appears 39 times (180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - Total for three-digit pages: 168 times for 4, 78 times for 8.\n\n**Total counts:**\n- 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I think this approach will make it easier to count without missing any numbers. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for the digit 8 (e.g., 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nHow many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, for each digit (4 and 8), in the units place, each complete set contributes 1 occurrence. Therefore, for 48 complete sets, that's 48 times for 4 and 48 times for 8. But wait, I also have the extra 8 pages from 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits in 481-488: 481 has 1, 482 has 2, 483 has 3, 484 has 4, 485 has 5, 486 has 6, 487 has 7, and 488 has 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, total for units place: 4's = 48 (from complete sets) + 1 (from extra) = 49. 8's = 48 +1 =49. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times. \n\nNow moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digits cycle every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, from 1-100, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, 0 appears in 1-9 and 100, but wait, 100 is actually a three-digit number, so maybe I should consider it differently. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of hundreds. Let me clarify.\n\nFor the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. But wait, from 1-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each ten numbers. So, from 1-99, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. Then, from 100-199, the tens digit cycles again 0-9 ten times each, and so on. \n\nBut in our case, the book goes up to 488, so we have 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. \n\nSo, let's calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFirst, from 1-99: Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit again cycles 0-9 ten times each, so 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, from 200-299: Same thing, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: Same, 10 times each.\n\nNow, from 400-488: The tens digit here cycles from 0-9 but only up to 488. So, the tens digit goes from 0-8 because 488 is the last page. Wait, let me think. From 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), 3 (430-439), 4 (440-449), 5 (450-459), 6 (460-469), 7 (470-479), and 8 (480-488). \n\nSo, each tens digit from 0-8 appears 9 times, except for 8, which appears 9 times as well because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, actually, each tens digit from 0-8 appears 10 times in a full hundred, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488), so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. But wait, in the tens place, each digit from 0-8 appears 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, actually, from 400-488, the tens digits go through 0-8, each appearing 9 times because 488 is the 88th page in the 400s. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 numbers\n- 410-419: tens digit 1, 10 numbers\n- 420-429: tens digit 2, 10 numbers\n- 430-439: tens digit 3, 10 numbers\n- 440-449: tens digit 4, 10 numbers\n- 450-459: tens digit 5, 10 numbers\n- 460-469: tens digit 6, 10 numbers\n- 470-479: tens digit 7, 10 numbers\n- 480-488: tens digit 8, 9 numbers (since 488 is the end)\n\nSo, in the tens place from 400-488, the digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place for 400-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, summarizing the tens place:\n\n- 1-99: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times\n- 100-199: 10 each\n- 200-299: 10 each\n- 300-399: 10 each\n- 400-488: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times\n\nSo total for tens place:\n\n4's: 10 +10 +10 +10 +10 = 50 times\n\n8's: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 times\n\nWait, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. And 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 480-488.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, let's see:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's here.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\n8's in the hundreds place: Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The next hundred would be 500-599, but we only go up to 488. So, 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n4's: 89 times\n\n8's: 0 times\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8, which seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's: 50, 8's:49.\n\nIn hundreds place, 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49+50+89=188\n\n8's total:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me verify each part again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many 4's and 8's in the units digit.\n\nEach 10 numbers contribute 1 for each digit. So, 488 /10=48 full sets, each contributing 1 for 4 and 1 for 8. So, 48 each.\n\nThen, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. That's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-99: each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-199: same, 10 each.\n\nFrom 200-299: same, 10 each.\n\nFrom 300-399: same, 10 each.\n\nFrom 400-488: tens digits go from 0-8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, in the tens place, 400-488: the tens digits go from 0-8, with each digit 0-7 appearing 10 times, and 8 appearing 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). So, total tens place:\n\n4's: 10 (from 440-449) + 10 (from 1-99) +10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399) = 50\n\n8's: 9 (from 480-488) +10 (from 1-99)+10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399) = 49\n\nWait, but in the 1-99 range, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times. Similarly, in each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately and then sum them up.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)*1 + extra if the last digit is >=4.\n\nWait, more accurately, for units digit, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n is calculated as:\n\nnumber = (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 1)\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think as:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nBut perhaps my initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, another way: for each digit place, calculate the count.\n\nUnits digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: For every 10 numbers, one 4. So, 488 /10=48 full cycles, contributing 48 4's. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 48+1=49.\n\nSame for 8's: 48 full cycles, 48 8's, and in the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears once (488). So, 49.\n\nTens digit:\n\nFor 4's:\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, 400-488 is not a full hundred, so we have to adjust.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 10 (from 1-99) +10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+10 (400-488) =50\n\nFor 8's in tens place:\n\nSimilarly, in each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, except for the last partial hundred (400-488). In 400-488, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 10 (1-99)+10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=49\n\nHundreds digit:\n\n4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, I think this is correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n- Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n- 4's: 48 occurrences + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n- 8's: 48 occurrences + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n- From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: 10 occurrences each.\n- From 400-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- Total 4's: 10 * 4 + 10 = 50.\n- Total 8's: 10 * 4 + 9 = 49.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- From 400-488: 4 appears 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n- Total 4's: 89.\n- Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4); in 11-20, it appears once at 14, and so on. \n\nNow, how many such sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each full set, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (at 484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, every 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times: 40-49. So, in each 100 numbers, 10 times. \n\nNow, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds and a partial hundred of 88 numbers (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 times. \n\nNow, the partial hundred: 401-488. Here, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 481-488, where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, that's another 10 times. \n\nWait, but 401-488 is only 88 numbers, so 440-449 is within that range, right? So, yes, 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from partial hundred) = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me check that: 400 is page 400, and 488 is the last page. So, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, in each set of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets and a partial set of 8 numbers. So, 48 times in full sets, and in the partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, in each 100 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times. So, in each full 100, 10 times. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds and a partial hundred of 88 numbers (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, 10 times. So, 4*10=40. Now, the partial hundred: 401-488. The tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., 8 for 481-490. But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Wait, no. The tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488. Wait, but 480 is page 480, which is included in the 401-488 range. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 times. But wait, in the tens place, each full hundred has 10 times, but in the partial hundred, it's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 (from partial) = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: From 1-400, each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, yes, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, the digit 8 in the hundreds place would only appear if the hundreds digit is 8, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 is the only one with 4 in units, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\n- Tens: Each 100 has 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full sets, each 1, so 48. Then, 481-488 includes 488, which has 8 in units, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\n- Tens: Each 100 has 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. From 1-400, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens digit in 480-488. The tens digit is 8 for all those numbers, right? So, 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 9.\n\nSimilarly, for the units digit, 488 is included, so units digit 8 appears once in the last partial set.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a bit high. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately and sum them up.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: For each 10 numbers, 1 occurrence. 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units, so 1 more. Total: 49.\n\nTens place: For each 100 numbers, 10 occurrences. 488 /100 = 4.88, so 4 full sets, each contributing 10, so 40. Plus, in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more. Total: 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: Same as 4's, 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 488 has an 8 in units, so 1 more. Total: 49.\n\nTens place: Each 100 has 10, so 4*10=40. Plus, in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more. Total: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each position and count the occurrences of 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, for example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4), and 8 appears once (page 8). This pattern repeats every 10 pages. \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the complete blocks, and then in the extra 8 pages, 484 would have a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4 in the units place. Similarly, for 8 in the units place, each block of 10 has one 8, so 48 times, and then in the extra pages, 488 is the last page, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8 in the units place. So, so far, both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences in the units place. \n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit changes every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each set of 100 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages, same with 8. \n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. \n\nIn each of these 100-page blocks, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 blocks would give 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each block, so 4 * 10 = 40 times for 8 in the tens place. \n\nNow, looking at the remaining pages from 401-488, which is 88 pages. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 pages. \n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Then, does 4 appear again in the tens place? No, because after 449, the next tens digit is 5 (450-459), then 6, etc., up to 8 (480-488). So, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. \n\nSimilarly, how about 8 in the tens place? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 pages (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. Wait, no, 480 is the first page, then 481, up to 488, which is 9 pages. But wait, 480 is included, so from 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 401-488. \n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in the range 480-488. So, 480 is page 480, and 488 is page 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this partial block. \n\nSo, total for the tens place: 4 in the first 400 pages: 40 times, plus 10 times in 401-488, so total 50 times. Similarly, 8 in the first 400 pages: 40 times, plus 9 times in 401-488, so total 49 times. \n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me make sure. So, in the first 400 pages, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times in the tens place (480-488). So, total for 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8: 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages, right? So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. \n\nOkay, so so far, for the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers from 100 to 488. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0, but we don't count those as they aren't printed. So, starting from 100, the hundreds digit is 1, then 2, 3, and 4. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be where 8 appears in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's count in the hundreds place is 0. \n\nSo, total for the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. \n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place. \n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. \n\nNow, the question is asking how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full tens and 8 extra pages. So, for units place, 48*1=48 for each digit, plus in the extra 8 pages (481-488), 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, units place: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each 100 pages have 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 400 pages would have 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place? \n\nFor 4 in the tens place: 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 times. \n\nFor 8 in the tens place: 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times. \n\nSo, total for tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That adds up correctly.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8. \n\nAdding them up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but 90 seems a bit high. Let me see if I missed something. Maybe I overcounted somewhere. \n\nWait, in the units place, I considered 488 pages, so for 488, the units digit is 8, so that's correct. For 484, it's 4. So, units place counts are correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 401-488: 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 times 4 in the tens place. 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is a big boost for 4's. So, 90 more 4's than 8's makes sense because of that.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - 488 pages = 48 full blocks of 10 + 8 extra pages.\n   - 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - 400 pages = 4 full blocks of 100, giving 40 each for 4 and 8.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total for 4: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total for 8: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra numbers, I need to check if there's another 4. The extra numbers are 481-488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes ten 4's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 is one block, 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block gives ten 4's, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is ten numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let me go through units, tens, and hundreds again.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in every set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of ten and 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each set gives one 8, so 48 times. In the extra numbers, 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Each full block (like 80-89, etc.) contributes ten 8's in the tens place, and the last partial block (480-488) contributes nine 8's. How many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks, each contributing ten 8's, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, the partial block 480-488 contributes nine 8's in the tens place (480-488, so 480, 481, ..., 488, which is nine numbers). So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 complete sets of ten (each contributing one 4) + 1 extra (484) = 49.\n- **Tens place:** Five blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.) contributing ten 4's each = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Numbers 400-488, contributing 89 4's.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 48 complete sets of ten + 1 extra (488) = 49.\n- **Tens place:** Four complete blocks (80-89, etc.) contributing ten 8's each + nine from 480-488 = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, from 1-488, the blocks would be 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's, so that's 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs from 400-488. So, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 gives 187. So, there are 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, I need to count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks and 8 extra pages. Each block contributes 1 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so that's one more 8 (which is 488). So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. Now, let's see how many such blocks are within 488.\n\nFrom 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would occur from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 8's in total.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 89 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens)\n- Tens: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) each giving 10, so 5*10=50\n- Hundreds: 488 - 400 +1 = 89\nTotal 4's: 48 +50 +89 = 187\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full tens (48) plus one more in 488, so 49\n- Tens: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each giving 10, so 4*10=40\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 +40 =89\n\nDifference: 187 -89=98.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 98 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 pages, totaling 48 times (488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times (5 blocks \u00d7 10).\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 pages, totaling 49 times (48 full sets + 1 in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 40 times (4 blocks \u00d7 10).\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 40 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 98.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{98}"
