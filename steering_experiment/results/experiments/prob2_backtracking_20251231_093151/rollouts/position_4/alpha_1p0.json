    "text": " Let me think about how many digits each page number has:\n\n- Pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, so they have only one number from 1 to 9.\n- Pages 10 to 99 are two-digit numbers, from 10 up to 99.\n- Pages 100 to 488 are three-digit numbers, starting from 100 up to 488.\n\nSo, I need to check each of these ranges separately to count how many times the digits 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFirst, let me count the number of 4's and 8's in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9):\n\n- The digit 4 appears once (page 4).\n- The digit 8 appears once (page 8).\n\nSo, in single-digit pages, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n\nNow, moving on to two-digit pages (10-99):\n\nLet me consider each digit position separately.\n\n1. Units place:\n   - For each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9.\n   - So, in each ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 14, 24, ..., 94).\n   - Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in the units place (e.g., 18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - There are 9 tens (10-99), so the number of 4's in the units place is 9, and the same for 8's.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - The tens digit is the same for all numbers in a ten. For example, in 10-19, the tens digit is 1.\n   - So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, we have the numbers 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, we have 80-89, which is another 10 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the two-digit numbers, the tens digit can only be from 1 to 9. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Same for 8 in the tens place, 80-89, another 10 times.\n\nSo, for two-digit pages:\n\n- 4's: 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19\n- 8's: 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19\n\nWait, but that can't be right because earlier in single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appeared once, so up to two-digit pages, 4's would be 1 + 19 = 20, and 8's would be 1 + 19 = 20. But wait, let me check again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, actually, for two-digit pages, the units place for each ten (from 10 to 99) has one 4 and one 8. So, for each ten, that's two digits per ten. So, 9 tens would give 9 times each for units place. Then, the tens place for 40-49 is 10 times, and for 80-89 is another 10 times.\n\nWait, but 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 80-89 is 10 times the digit 8 in the tens place. So, in two-digit numbers, 4's: 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19, and 8's: 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19. Then, adding the single-digit pages, 4's: 1 + 19 = 20, and 8's: 1 + 19 = 20. So, up to page 99, both 4's and 8's appear 20 times each.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages, which are from 100 to 488. So, let's consider each digit position: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, hundreds place:\n\n- The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nNext, tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\nWe need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place from 100 to 488.\n\nLet's break this down by each hundred:\n\n1. 100-199:\n   - The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers.\n   - For each hundred, each digit (0-9) appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - So, for digit 4 in the tens place: 10 times (140-149).\n   - Similarly, for digit 8 in the tens place: 10 times (180-189).\n\n2. 200-299:\n   - Same as above: 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\n3. 300-399:\n   - Again, same: 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\n4. 400-488:\n   - Here, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page).\n   - So, for digit 4 in the tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n   - For digit 8 in the tens place: 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for these 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. When the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up across all hundreds:\n\n- For 4 in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40 times.\n- For 8 in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit for 8 is only up to 488, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, hence 9 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\nAgain, let's consider each hundred and then the last partial hundred (400-488).\n\n1. 100-199:\n   - For each ten, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, for each ten, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once.\n   - There are 10 tens (100-109, 110-119, ..., 190-199), so for each hundred, 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\n2. 200-299:\n   - Same as above: 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\n3. 300-399:\n   - Same: 10 times each.\n\n4. 400-488:\n   - Here, the units digit cycles from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page.\n   - So, for each ten in 400-488, we have the units digit going up to 8.\n   - Let's see: from 400-488, how many tens are there? Well, 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. That's 9 full tens (400-409 up to 470-479) and then a partial ten from 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\n   So, for each full ten (400-409, etc.), the units digit 4 appears once, and 8 appears once.\n\n   Let's count:\n\n   - From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each tens digit, the units digit 4 appears once, except when the units digit would go beyond 8 in the last partial ten.\n\n   Wait, but in 480-488, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 8 appears once (488), and 4 appears once (484). Wait, but 484 is within 480-488, so yes, 4 appears once.\n\n   So, for each of the 9 tens (400-488), the units digit 4 appears once, except that in the last ten (480-488), units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once. So, total units place for 4 in 400-488: 9 tens \u00d7 1 (each ten has a 4 in units) = 9 times.\n\n   Similarly, for 8 in the units place: in each ten, 8 appears once, except in the last ten, where it appears once as well (488). So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach ten from 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479 has one 4 in the units place (404, 414, ..., 474). That's 8 times (from 400-479). Then, in 480-488, we have 484, which is another 4. So, total 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place: in each ten from 400-409, ..., 470-479, we have 408, 418, ..., 478, which is 8 times. Then, in 480-488, we have 488, which is another 8. So, total 9 times.\n\nSo, in the units place for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n- 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, earlier I thought that in each hundred, the units digit 4 and 8 each appear 10 times, so three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) would each contribute 10 times, so 3\u00d710=30, and then 400-488 contributes 9 times, making it 39. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts:\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds: 89\n  - Tens: 40\n  - Units: 39\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 89 + 40 + 39\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Because when I broke down the three-digit numbers, I considered hundreds, tens, and units separately, but I think I might have double-counted or misapplied the ranges.\n\nWait, let's correct this. Let me structure it properly:\n\nFor three-digit numbers (100-488), each page number is ABC, where A is the hundreds digit, B is the tens, and C is the units.\n\nWe need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each position.\n\nLet me handle each position separately.\n\n1. Hundreds place (A):\n   - 100-199: A=1 \u2192 no 4's or 8's.\n   - 200-299: A=2 \u2192 no 4's or 8's.\n   - 300-399: A=3 \u2192 no 4's or 8's.\n   - 400-488: A=4 \u2192 4 appears 89 times (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n   - 800-899: Not applicable since the book ends at 488.\n\n   So, 4's in hundreds place: 89\n   8's in hundreds place: 0\n\n2. Tens place (B):\n   - For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens digit.\n\n   For each hundred:\n   - In 100-199, B cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, 4 appears 10 times (140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n   - Similarly, in 200-299: 10 each.\n   - In 300-399: 10 each.\n   - In 400-488: B cycles from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for B=4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For B=8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\n   So, total for tens place:\n   - 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\n   - 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\n3. Units place (C):\n   - For each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, so in each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the units place.\n   - However, in 400-488, the last ten is 480-488, which only goes up to 8, so the units digit 8 appears once (488), and 4 appears once (484).\n\n   So, for units place:\n   - In 100-199: 10 each\n   - In 200-299: 10 each\n   - In 300-399: 10 each\n   - In 400-488: 9 each (since 488 is the last page, so units digits go up to 8, meaning 4 and 8 each appear once in the last ten)\n   Wait, no, actually, in 400-488, for each ten, the units digit cycles 0-9 except in the last ten, which only goes up to 8.\n\n   So, let me correct this:\n\n   For units place in 400-488:\n   - From 400-479: Each ten has 10 units digits, so 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n   - From 480-488: Units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\n   So, total units place in 400-488:\n   - 4's: 8 (from 400-479) + 1 (484) = 9\n   - 8's: 8 (from 400-479) + 1 (488) = 9\n\n   Wait, no, that's not correct. Because from 400-479, there are 8 tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479). Each of these tens has 10 units digits, so in each, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 8 tens \u00d7 1 = 8 each.\n\n   Then, in 480-488, which is the 9th ten, units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\n   So, total units place in 400-488:\n   - 4's: 8 (from 400-479) + 1 (484) = 9\n   - 8's: 8 (from 400-479) + 1 (488) = 9\n\n   Therefore, for units place across all three-digit numbers:\n   - 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\n   - 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts for 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds: 89\n  - Tens: 40\n  - Units: 39\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 89 + 40 + 39\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect because I think I'm adding the three-digit counts incorrectly. Let me correct this.\n\nActually, for three-digit numbers, the counts are:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds: 0\n  - Tens: 39\n  - Units: 39\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 0 + 39 + 39 = 98\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, for 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds: 0\n  - Tens: 39\n  - Units: 39\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 0 + 39 + 39 = 98\n\nWait, but wait, in the three-digit numbers, the units place for 8's is 39, and the tens place is 39, so that's 78. Plus the single-digit and two-digit counts: 1 + 19 = 20. So, total 8's: 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 168. So, 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the three-digit counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nThree-digit numbers: 100-488\n\n4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 times\n- Tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40\n- Units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\nTotal 4's in three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\n8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\n- Units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\nTotal 8's in three-digit: 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding single and two-digit counts:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a more efficient way to calculate this?\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position across all page numbers.\n\nTotal pages: 488\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\n1. Units place:\n\nFor each complete set of 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place.\n\nTotal complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 488 / 10 = 48 full sets, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nSo, in units place:\n\n- Number of 4's: 48 full sets \u00d7 1 = 48, plus in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4, so +1 \u2192 total 49.\n- Number of 8's: 48 full sets \u00d7 1 = 48, plus in the remaining 8 numbers, 488 has an 8, so +1 \u2192 total 49.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because in the units place, the last partial set is 481-488, which are 8 numbers. So, in the units digits, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place:\n\n- 4's: 48 \u00d7 1 + 1 = 49\n- 8's: 48 \u00d7 1 + 1 = 49\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nEach digit appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers. For example, in 0-99, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 100-199, 200-299, etc.\n\nBut since we're going up to 488, let's see:\n\nTotal complete hundreds: 4 (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n\nFor each complete hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut 400-488 is not a complete hundred; it's 89 numbers.\n\nSo, for tens place:\n\n- Complete hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399): 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 times each for 4 and 8.\n- Partial hundred (400-488): The tens digits go from 0 to 8, as 488 is the last page.\n\nIn 400-488, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each digit appear?\n\nEach tens digit appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 9 times (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is 89 numbers. Let's see:\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digits cycle from 0 to 8, but the last group (480-488) has only 9 numbers. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 7, there are 10 numbers, and for 8, there are 9.\n\nSo, for the tens digit 4: appears 10 times (440-449)\nFor the tens digit 8: appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nTherefore, in the partial hundred (400-488):\n\n- 4's in tens place: 10\n- 8's in tens place: 9\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n- 4's: 3\u00d710 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 400-449) = 40\n- 8's: 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\nEach hundred block contributes 100 numbers where the hundreds digit is fixed.\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit 1 \u2192 no 4's or 8's\n- 200-299: hundreds digit 2 \u2192 no 4's or 8's\n- 300-399: hundreds digit 3 \u2192 no 4's or 8's\n- 400-488: hundreds digit 4 \u2192 89 numbers, so 89 times\n- 800-899: Not applicable\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, summing up all positions:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 49\n  - 8's: 49\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 40\n  - 8's: 39\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88\n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier calculation where I had 188 and 98. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the units place calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the units place, for each page number from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nEach complete set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNumber of complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets (since 48\u00d710=480), with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nSo, units place:\n\n- 4's: 48 \u00d7 1 = 48, plus in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4, so +1 \u2192 total 49\n- 8's: 48 \u00d7 1 = 48, plus in the remaining 8 numbers, 488 has an 8, so +1 \u2192 total 49\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 times for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nFor 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, with 480-488 being the last partial set.\n\nSo, in 400-488:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n- 4's: 3\u00d710 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-449) = 40\n- 8's: 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 (from 400-488)\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88\n\nWait, but earlier I had 188 and 98. There's a discrepancy here. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nAh, I think the mistake was in the initial approach where I considered single-digit and two-digit pages separately, but in the second approach, I considered all pages from 1 to 488, which includes single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit. So, in the second approach, I included all pages, which might have been more accurate.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I had:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 each\n- Two-digit: 19 each\n- Three-digit: 168 (4's) and 78 (8's)\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nBut in the second approach, considering all pages as units, tens, hundreds:\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88\n\nHmm, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the second approach is more accurate because it considers all positions across all pages, including single-digit and two-digit.\n\nWait, let me check the units place in the second approach. From 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial set.\n\nSo, number of times 4 appears in units place:\n\nNumber of complete sets of 10: 48, each contributing one 4, so 48.\n\nPlus, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4, so +1 \u2192 total 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place.\n\nSo, from 1-99:\n\n- Tens digits are 0-9, each appearing 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 0 appears in 1-9, but wait, no, in two-digit numbers, the tens digit is from 1-9. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust for single-digit numbers.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the second approach by not accounting for single-digit numbers correctly.\n\nWait, in the second approach, I considered all pages from 1-488, but in reality, single-digit numbers (1-9) don't have a tens or hundreds digit. So, when considering the tens and hundreds places, they don't contribute to those positions.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the second approach is incorrect because it assumes that all positions are present in all pages, which they aren't.\n\nSo, maybe the first approach was correct, where I considered single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit pages separately.\n\nLet me try to reconcile both approaches.\n\nIn the first approach:\n\n- Single-digit (1-9):\n  - 4's: 1\n  - 8's: 1\n- Two-digit (10-99):\n  - 4's: 19\n  - 8's: 19\n- Three-digit (100-488):\n  - 4's: 168\n  - 8's: 78\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nIn the second approach, considering all pages, including single-digit, the units place counts would include single-digit pages, but the tens and hundreds places wouldn't.\n\nWait, perhaps the second approach should be adjusted to account for the fact that single-digit pages don't have tens or hundreds digits.\n\nSo, in the second approach, when calculating the tens and hundreds places, we should only consider pages that have those digits, i.e., two-digit and three-digit pages.\n\nSo, let's adjust the second approach:\n\n1. Units place:\n   - From 1-488, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place.\n   - As before, 4's: 49, 8's: 49\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - From 10-488, each digit 0-9 appears in the tens place.\n   - For each hundred block (10-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each ten"

    "text": " Let me think about how the digits 4 and 8 appear in each position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nMaybe I should handle each digit position separately. So, I'll consider the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place: For each complete set of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. But wait, I need to check if this holds true all the way up to 488.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: In each set of a hundred pages, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times per hundred. So, both 4 and 8 would each appear 10 times in the tens place for every hundred pages.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, actually, page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place only from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the highest hundreds digit is 4.\n\nWait, but I should check if the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99. So, 0 doesn't count as a digit, so the hundreds place doesn't contribute to the count of 4's or 8's in those cases. So, 4's in the hundreds place: 89 times. 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nNow, let me calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor each group of 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and a partial group of 8 pages (488 = 48*10 + 8). So, in the units place, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times, but the last partial group (481-488) will have units digits 1 through 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times (once in each complete group) plus 0 times in the last partial group because 4 isn't in 1-8. So, units place 4's: 48.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears 48 times in the units place, plus 1 time in the last partial group because 8 is in 488. Wait, no, the last partial group is 481-488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 8 is present once in the units place in the last group. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that. For each complete group of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete groups, so 48 times. Then, in the last group, which is pages 481-488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so 8 is present once. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, 4's in units place: Each complete group has one 4, so 48 times. The last group doesn't include a 4 in the units place, so total 48.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place:\n\nIn each group of 100 pages, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining pages are 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, in the tens place, for 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for the last partial group.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, the tens digit for 401-488 is as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 pages)\n\nSo, each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in this last partial hundred.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in the 401-410 group, and 8 appears 10 times in the 481-490 group, but since we only go up to 488, 8 appears 8 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit for 481-488 is 8, but that's only 8 pages, so 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in this range.\n\nSo, total in the tens place:\n\nFor 4's: 4 complete hundreds * 10 = 40, plus in the 401-488 range, 4's in the tens place are in 441-450, which is 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, no, wait. Actually, in each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 is in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so another 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: In each complete hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds *10=40. Then, in the 401-488 range, 8 appears in the tens place in 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so that's 8 pages, so 8 times. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, total 48 times for 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving to the hundreds place:\n\nAs I thought earlier, 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n8's in hundreds place: Since the highest page is 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for 4's and 8's across all digit positions.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, let me double-check these calculations.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: 48\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 48\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for 4's, I had 4 hundreds contributing 10 each, so 40, plus in the 401-488 range, 441-450, which is another 10, so 50 total. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: 4 hundreds contributing 10 each, so 40, plus in the 401-488 range, 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, 40 + 8 = 48. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the last group from 481-488 contributes an extra 8 in the units place, so 49 for 8's, and 48 for 4's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 187, 8's: 97. Difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when dealing with ranges, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the units place, 488 pages mean 488 numbers. Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full groups (480 pages) contribute 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once more, making 49 8's, and 4 doesn't appear in the units place here, so 48 4's. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 more 4's. For 8's, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 pages, so 8 more 8's. So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place: 4's from 400-488: 89 times. 8's: 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nWait, but when I think about it, the hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so yes, 89 4's.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 187, and 8's is 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place would have more, but no, 89 is correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let me calculate total digits.\n\nTotal pages: 488\n\nEach page has 1, 2, or 3 digits.\n\nPages 1-9: 1 digit each, 9 pages.\n\nPages 10-99: 2 digits each, 90 pages.\n\nPages 100-488: 3 digits each, 389 pages.\n\nTotal digits: 9*1 + 90*2 + 389*3 = 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nBut maybe that's not necessary, but just to confirm that my count of 4's and 8's is reasonable.\n\n187 4's and 97 8's, so 90 more 4's. That seems plausible.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the 401-488 range. When I broke it down, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, how many times does it appear?\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 times\n- 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 times\n- 421-430: tens digit 2, 10 times\n- 431-440: tens digit 3, 10 times\n- 441-450: tens digit 4, 10 times\n- 451-460: tens digit 5, 10 times\n- 461-470: tens digit 6, 10 times\n- 471-480: tens digit 7, 10 times\n- 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 times\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, in the 401-488 range, 4's in tens place: 10, 8's:8.\n\nSo, adding to the previous counts:\n\n4's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) +10=50\n\n8's in tens place:40 (from 1-400) +8=48\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSo, the total counts are as I had before: 187 4's and 97 8's, difference 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. The last group is 481-488, units digits 1-8, so no 4's. So, total 48 4's in units place.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: same 48 times, plus one more in the last group (488), so 49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Digit Positions:**\n   - Consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n2. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 groups (480 pages).\n   - 4 appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - 8 appears 48 times in the units place, plus one more in the last partial group (488), totaling 49.\n\n3. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - From 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for '4' and '8' in the tens place.\n     - '4' in tens place: 4*10 = 40\n     - '8' in tens place: 4*10 = 40\n   - From 401-488: \n     - '4' appears 10 times in 441-450.\n     - '8' appears 8 times in 481-488.\n   - Total:\n     - '4': 40 + 10 = 50\n     - '8': 40 + 8 = 48\n\n4. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n5. **Total Counts:**\n   - '4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n   - '8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n6. **Difference:**\n   - 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8' in the page numbers.  \n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place, I need to count how often 4 and 8 appear in the units digit across all page numbers. For the units digit, every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 cycle once. So, in each block of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. But wait, from page 1 to page 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra pages. In each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each. Now, the extra 8 pages (from 481 to 488) include page 484, which has a 4 in the units place, and page 488, which has an 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, so in the units place, they're equal? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me check again. From 1 to 488, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place except possibly the last partial block. Since 488 ends with 8, the last partial block is pages 481-488, which are 8 pages. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 48 times in the complete blocks plus once in the partial block, totaling 49 each. So, units place: 4 and 8 each have 49 occurrences. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of the 4 full hundreds, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8. Now, the partial hundred from 401-488: the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. And 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, from 480-488, that's 9 pages, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred. So, adding that to the full hundreds: 40 + 10 = 50 times for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 times for 8 in the tens place. \n\nWait, let me make sure. For the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for each ten's digit, 0-8, each appears 9 times? Wait, no. Actually, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, for each ten's digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear? From 401-488, each ten's digit from 0 to 8 appears 9 times except for 8, which appears 9 times as well because 480-488 is 9 pages. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages, so the ten's digit 8 appears 9 times, same as the others. So, actually, in the partial hundred, each ten's digit from 0 to 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, the digit 4 in the tens place appears 9 times (440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? 440-449 is 10 pages, but since we're only going up to 488, does that affect it? Wait, no, because 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so the ten's digit 4 appears 10 times. Similarly, the ten's digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, total in tens place: 4 appears 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit. Pages 100-199 have a hundreds digit of 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. \n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 across all digit places. \n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- 48 complete blocks of 10: 48 * 1 = 48 for both 4 and 8\n- Partial block 481-488: 484 (4) and 488 (8), so +1 each\nTotal: 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Full hundreds (4 sets): 10 each, so 40 each\n- Partial hundred 401-488:\n  - 4 in tens: 440-449: 10 pages\n  - 8 in tens: 480-488: 9 pages\nTotal: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 for 4\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider the digits in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately. That way, I can count how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Similarly, from 11 to 20, the units digits repeat the same pattern. So, in general, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit appears once in the units place. \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then a partial block of 8 numbers. So, for each digit in the units place, it appears 48 times in each complete block. But then, we have to check the partial block from 481 to 488. Let's see, the units digits there are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once.\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from complete blocks) plus 1 (from the partial block), totaling 49. Similarly, the number of 8's in the units place is also 48 plus 1, which is 49. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times.\n\nNext, let's consider the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 numbers. For example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, from 10-19 it's 1, from 20-29 it's 2, and so on. So, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times for each block of 100 numbers. \n\nWait, let me think again. Actually, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, for example, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in 40-49, then again 10 times in 140-149, and so on. \n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Then, we have the remaining 88 pages: 401-488. \n\nSo, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in each of the 4 complete hundreds, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, that's 4 x 10 = 40 times for 4 and 4 x 10 = 40 times for 8.\n\nNow, let's look at the partial block from 401-488. The tens digit here ranges from 0 (401-410, but wait, 401 is 401, so the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digits in 401-488 are from 0 to 8, but let me check each.\n\nWait, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: 1, 421-430:2, 431-440:3, 441-450:4, 451-460:5, 461-470:6, 471-480:7, and 481-488:8. So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place in 401-488?\n\nEach of these blocks is 10 numbers except the last one, which is only 8 numbers (481-488). So, for each digit from 0 to 8 in the tens place, how many times do they appear?\n\n- 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- 1: 10 times (411-420)\n- 2: 10 times (421-430)\n- 3: 10 times (431-440)\n- 4: 10 times (441-450)\n- 5: 10 times (451-460)\n- 6: 10 times (461-470)\n- 7: 10 times (471-480)\n- 8: 8 times (481-488)\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because from 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but there are only 8 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in this partial block.\n\nSo, in the tens place, in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, for the tens place overall, the number of 4's is 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50. The number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Each complete hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds give 4 x 10 = 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 times, so adding 10 to the 4's count. For 8's, in the partial hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because the partial block is 401-488, which is 88 numbers. The tens digits in this range go from 0 to 8, but each digit from 0 to 8 appears a certain number of times. Specifically, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each because each of those digits corresponds to a full set of 10 numbers (e.g., 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, etc.), except for 8, which only appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nSo, yes, 4 appears 10 times in 441-450, and 8 appears 8 times in 481-488. Therefore, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 1: 100 times (100-199)\n- 2: 100 times (200-299)\n- 3: 100 times (300-399)\n- 4: 89 times (400-488, which is 89 pages, since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 49\n  - 8's: 49\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 50\n  - 8's: 48\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n\nNow, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. For 8's, 49 + 48 is 97. So, 188 - 97 is 91. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each place again.\n\nUnits place: Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in each position, except the last partial block. For units, the last block is 481-488, so units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So, total units 4's: 48*10 blocks? Wait, no, wait: Wait, the total number of complete blocks is 48, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then, in the partial block, 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So, total 4's in units: 48 + 1 = 49, same for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred (1-100, etc.) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, so adding 10 to 4's. For 8's, in the partial hundred, tens digit 8 is in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, total 4's in tens: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 +8=48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears. So, 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+48+0=97. Difference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's compute the total number of digits printed.\n\nEach page from 1-9: 1 digit each, so 9 pages, 9 digits.\n\nPages 10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each, so 180 digits.\n\nPages 100-488: 488 - 100 +1 = 389 pages, 3 digits each, so 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, total number of 4's:188, 8's:97. So, 188 +97=285. The remaining digits:1356 -285=1071. That seems plausible, but maybe not necessary for the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of another approach. Let's consider each digit position separately.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place. So, the number of times each digit appears is floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So, total 4's in units:48 +1=49, 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.), each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 each.\n\nThen, the partial hundred:401-488. The tens digits here go from 0 to 8, each appearing a certain number of times. Specifically, for each digit d from 0 to 8, the number of times it appears in the tens place is:\n\n- For d=0: 10 times (401-410)\n- d=1:10 (411-420)\n- d=2:10 (421-430)\n- d=3:10 (431-440)\n- d=4:10 (441-450)\n- d=5:10 (451-460)\n- d=6:10 (461-470)\n- d=7:10 (471-480)\n- d=8:8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, total 4's in tens place:40 +10=50, 8's:40 +8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly digits 1,2,3,4 appear, each in their respective hundreds. So, 1 appears 100 times (1-100), 2 appears 100 (101-200), 3 appears 100 (201-300), and 4 appears 89 times (400-488). So, 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0=97\n\nDifference:188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Because the hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 have no hundreds digit, so 4 and 8 don't appear there in the hundreds place. So, yes, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For the hundreds digit, how many times does each digit appear?\n\n- 1:100-199, so 100 times\n- 2:200-299, 100 times\n- 3:300-399, 100 times\n- 4:400-488, which is 89 times\n- 5-9: don't appear because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, yes, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97, so the difference is 91. Therefore, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me add up the 4's again:\n\nUnits:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's: Units:49, Tens:48, Hundreds:0. 49+48=97.\n\n188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in complete blocks of 10.\n   - In the partial block (481-488), 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100.\n   - In 4 complete hundreds, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 each.\n   - In the partial block (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should separate the counting based on the number of digits.\n\nLet me start by considering one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, how many 4's and 8's are there? Well, each digit from 1 to 9 appears exactly once. So, there's one 4 and one 8 in this range. That means the count for 4's is 1 and for 8's is also 1. So, the difference here is 0.\n\nNext, I should look at two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place for two-digit numbers: The tens digit can be 1 to 9, and the units digit can be 0 to 9. So, for each tens digit, the units digit cycles through 0-9. \n\nFor the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, when the tens digit is 4, the units digit can be 0-9, so that's 10 times. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, that's another 10 times.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: The units digit cycles from 0-9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens digit (1-9), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. That means 9 times (once for each tens digit from 1 to 9). Similarly, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, adding up the two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. Similarly, the total number of 8's is 10 + 9 = 19. So, again, the difference is 0.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Because in two-digit numbers, the tens digit goes from 1 to 9, but the units digit goes from 0 to 9. So, for each digit in the units place, there are 9 possibilities for the tens digit, right? So, for the units place, the number of times 4 appears is 9, and similarly for 8. But in the tens place, when the digit is 4, it's 10 times (for 40-49), and when it's 8, it's 10 times (for 80-89). So, that part seems correct.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, 4's: 10 + 9 = 19, and 8's: 10 + 9 = 19. So, same as before, the difference is 0.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units. I need to consider each place separately again.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nWhen the hundreds digit is 4, the page numbers range from 400 to 488. So, I need to be careful here because the hundreds digit is 4 only up to 488, not all the way to 499. So, when the hundreds digit is 4, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in this range because the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nWait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only for 400-488, so 89 times. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3 for the other three-digit numbers, so 100-399. In this range, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so 4 and 8 don't appear in the hundreds place. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundreds group. Let's break it down by hundreds.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each of these has 100 numbers (100-199, 200-299, 300-399). In each of these, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundreds group, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). Since there are three hundreds groups (1, 2, 3), each contributing 10 times, the total for 4's in the tens place is 3 * 10 = 30, and similarly for 8's, it's 3 * 10 = 30.\n\nNow, for the hundreds group where the hundreds digit is 4 (400-488), the tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, let's see: the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, and for each tens digit, the units digit goes from 0-9, except when the tens digit is 8, where the units digit only goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for the tens digit 4 in 400-488, how many times does it appear? Let's see, the tens digit is 4, so the numbers are 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for the tens digit 8, the numbers would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. When the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, for each tens digit, the units digit can be 0-9, except when the tens digit is 8, where the units digit only goes up to 8. So, for tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, in the tens place for the 400-488 range, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous counts, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40. Similarly, the total number of 8's in the tens place is 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, let's break it down by hundreds groups.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each group has 100 numbers. In each group, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit. So, for each hundreds group, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194), and similarly for 8 (e.g., 108, 118, ..., 198). Since there are three hundreds groups, that's 3 * 10 = 30 for 4's and 3 * 10 = 30 for 8's.\n\nNow, for the hundreds group 400-488: The units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit, except when the tens digit is 8, where the units digit only goes up to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 7, the units digit cycles 0-9, giving 10 occurrences each. For tens digit 8, the units digit goes up to 8, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, for each tens digit, the number of times the units digit is 4 or 8:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 numbers, so for units digit 4, that's 1 occurrence per tens digit, and same for 8.\n\n- For tens digit 8: Units digits go up to 8, so units digit 4 appears once (484) and units digit 8 appears once (488).\n\nWait, but let me think again. For each tens digit from 0 to 7, the units digit cycles 0-9, so for each, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, for 8 tens digits (0-7), that's 8 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. Then, for tens digit 8, units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total in the units place for 400-488:\n\n- 4's: 8 (from tens digits 0-7) + 1 (from tens digit 8) = 9 times.\n\n- 8's: 8 (from tens digits 0-7) + 1 (from tens digit 8) = 9 times.\n\nWait, but that seems off because in each tens digit from 0-7, the units digit 4 appears once, so 8 times, and units digit 8 appears once, so 8 times. Then, in tens digit 8, units digit 4 appears once (484) and units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total for 4's in units place: 8 + 1 = 9, and 8's: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous counts from 100-399:\n\n- 4's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\n- 8's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the 400-488 range, the units digit 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times, so adding to 30 each, that's 39 each. But let me check: for each hundreds group 1-3, units digit 4 appears 10 times each, so 3*10=30. Then, in 400-488, units digit 4 appears 9 times, so total 39. Similarly for 8's.\n\nWait, but in the 400-488 range, in the units place, for each tens digit 0-7, units digit 4 appears once, so 8 times, and then in tens digit 8, units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 8 + 1 = 9 times. So, 30 + 9 = 39 for 4's in units place. Same for 8's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, now, adding up all the places for three-digit numbers:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, in the tens place, I had 30 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488, totaling 39 for 8's. Similarly, units place was 30 + 9 = 39. So, 39 + 39 = 78 for 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place for 8's in three-digit numbers was 30 (from 100-399) plus 9 (from 400-488), totaling 39, and units place was 30 + 9 = 39, so total 78.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in three-digit numbers, hundreds place is 89, tens place is 40, units place is 39, so 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the digits from one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nFrom one-digit:\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nFrom two-digit:\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nFrom three-digit:\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me go through each part again.\n\nOne-digit numbers:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit numbers:\n- Tens place: 10 for 4, 10 for 8\n- Units place: 9 for 4, 9 for 8\nTotal: 19 each\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4: 89 (400-488)\n  - 8: 0\n- Tens place:\n  - 4: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (440-449) = 40\n  - 8: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (480-488) = 39\n- Units place:\n  - 4: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\n  - 8: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\nSo, 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding all together:\n- 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n- 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the three-digit numbers, especially the units place for 400-488. When the tens digit is 8, the units digit goes up to 8, so 480-488. So, in the units place for 400-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let me list them:\n\n440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447, 448, 449: That's 10 times for the tens digit 4.\n\nWait, no, that's in the tens place. Wait, for the units place, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in numbers like 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. So, that's 9 times, because when the tens digit is 8, the units digit 4 is in 484, which is within 488. So, that's correct: 9 times in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times as well.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For three-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 168 and 8's is 78. So, the difference is 90. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\n1. **One-digit page numbers (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once.\n   - 8 appears once.\n\n2. **Two-digit page numbers (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 9 times (once for each tens digit 1-9), and similarly for 8.\n   - Total: 19 each.\n\n3. **Three-digit page numbers (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 does not appear.\n   - **Tens place:** \n     - 4 appears 30 times (100-399) + 10 times (440-449) = 40.\n     - 8 appears 30 times (100-399) + 9 times (480-488) = 39.\n   - **Units place:** \n     - 4 appears 30 times (100-399) + 9 times (400-488) = 39.\n     - 8 appears 30 times (100-399) + 9 times (400-488) = 39.\n   - Total for 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n   - Total for 8's: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\n**Total counts:**\n- 4's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- 8's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how many digits each page number has:\n\n- Pages 1 to 9: These are single-digit numbers, so each has only one digit.\n- Pages 10 to 99: These are two-digit numbers, each having two digits.\n- Pages 100 to 488: These are three-digit numbers, each having three digits.\n\nI think I should handle each of these ranges separately because the number of digits changes, which affects how often the digits 4 and 8 appear. Maybe I can calculate the number of times 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for 8, then find the difference.\n\nLet me start by calculating how many times the digit 4 appears in each position.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every block of 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to page 488?\n\nWait, but page 488 is the last page, so I need to consider up to 488. Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That would be 48 times. But wait, the last block is from 481 to 488, which is only 8 pages, so maybe the 48th block ends at 480, and then there's a partial block from 481 to 488. So in the units place, the 4 would appear once in each block, so 48 times, but I should check if the 48th block includes a 4. Wait, 480 is the last page of the 48th block, so the 48th block is 471-480, right? Because 471-480 is the 48th block. So in that case, each of the 48 blocks contributes a 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, let me confirm: pages 1-10, 11-20, ..., 471-480, 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is only 481-488, which is 8 pages. But in the units place, the 4 would appear in 484, so that's one more 4. So total units place 4's would be 48 (from the 48 blocks) plus 1 more in the last partial block, making it 49.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated as the number of complete tens. So for 488 pages, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48 times, plus if the last page is 488, which is 488, the units digit is 8, so there's no extra 4 in the units place. Wait, but 484 would have a 4 in the units place, so in the last partial block from 481-488, 484 is included, so that's an extra 4. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488 / 10) is 48. Then, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 + (if the units digit is >=4, but in this case, the last page is 488, which ends with 8, so 484 is within the 481-488 range, so that's one more 4, making it 49.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better way is to calculate it as (number of complete tens) + (1 if the last page's units digit is >=4). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, for each digit position, the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the units place: The number of times 4 appears is (total pages // 10) + min(max(0, (total pages % 10) - 4 + 1), 1). Wait, maybe that's a formula I can use.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of each digit place separately.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of 4's in the units place.\n\nUnits place:\n\nEach digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place every 10 numbers. So for every 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. So up to page N, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(N / 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >=4 else 0). Wait, but let me test this with N=488.\n\nfloor(488 / 10) = 48. Then, 488 % 10 = 8, which is >=4, so we add 1. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each cycle of 100 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So for 488 pages, the number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 4*100=400), and then 88 pages remaining.\n\nSo in the tens place, the number of times 4 appears is:\n\nFor each hundred block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times (from 400-499), but we only go up to 488, which is 88 pages beyond 400. So the tens digit in 401-488 goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? It appears once, from 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. So total tens place 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-409: tens digit is 0\n410-419: tens digit is 1\n...\n440-449: tens digit is 4 (10 times)\n...\n480-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears exactly once in the block 440-449, which is 10 times. So total tens place 4's: 4*10 (from 0-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is included, so 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me verify:\n\nWait, units place: 49\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, let's do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nSame method: floor(488 / 10) = 48, and 488 % 10 = 8, which is >=8, so we add 1. So units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is included, so in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 pages, and in the last partial block, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's correct: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place for 8's:\n\nEach hundred block has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So for 4 complete hundreds (0-399), that's 4*10=40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8 (480-488). So how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? From 480-488, that's 9 pages (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place for 8's:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, units place for 4's:49, 8's:49. Tens place for 4's:50, 8's:49. Hundreds place for 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo 4's:49+50+89=188\n8's:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 pages. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 400-488 inclusive is 89 pages because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So yes, 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 4's: in each hundred block, 10 times, so 4 blocks (0-399) give 40, and in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs once in 440-449, which is 10 times, so total 50. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's, in the tens place, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times, so total 49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences. So the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly. Maybe I can think of a smaller example to verify.\n\nSuppose the book has 20 pages. Let's see how many 4's and 8's are there.\n\nPage numbers:1-20.\n\n4's: 4,14 => units place:2 times.\n8's:8,18 => units place:2 times.\nTens place: 40-49 isn't in 1-20, so 0.\nHundreds place: none, since it's 1-20.\nSo total 4's:2, 8's:2. Difference:0.\n\nWait, but according to my method:\n\nUnits place 4's: floor(20/10)=2, and 20%10=0, which is less than 4, so units place 4's:2.\n\nTens place 4's: floor(20/100)=0, so 0, plus in 0-20, the tens digit 4 doesn't appear, so 0.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 4's:2+0+0=2.\n\nUnits place 8's: floor(20/10)=2, 20%10=0, which is less than 8, so 2.\n\nTens place 8's: floor(20/100)=0, so 0, plus in 0-20, the tens digit 8 doesn't appear, so 0.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:2+0+0=2.\n\nDifference:0. That's correct.\n\nAnother example: 50 pages.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits: floor(50/10)=5, 50%10=0, which is less than 4, so 5.\n\nTens: floor(50/100)=0, so 0, plus in 0-50, the tens digit 4 appears once in 40-49, which is 10 times, but since we're only going up to 50, it's 10 times. So tens place 4's:10.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 4's:5+10=15.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits: floor(50/10)=5, 50%10=0, less than 8, so 5.\n\nTens: floor(50/100)=0, so 0, plus in 0-50, the tens digit 8 appears once in 80-89, but 50 is less than 80, so 0.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 8's:5+0=5.\n\nDifference:15-5=10.\n\nWait, let me count manually:\n\n4's:4,14,24,34,44 => units:5 times.\n\n40-49: each has 4 in tens place, so 10 times.\n\nTotal 4's:15.\n\n8's:8,18,28,38,48 => units:5 times.\n\nTens place: none in 1-50.\n\nTotal 8's:5.\n\nDifference:10. So my method works here.\n\nTherefore, applying the same method to 488 pages, I think the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another example to be sure.\n\nSay, 100 pages.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits: floor(100/10)=10, 100%10=0 <4, so 10.\n\nTens: floor(100/100)=1, so 10 times in tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), but wait, 100 pages would have 10 times in each hundred. So for 100 pages, 10 times in the tens place.\n\nHundreds:0, since 100 is the next page, but page 100 is included, so hundreds digit 1 appears once.\n\nWait, no, in 1-100, the hundreds digit is 0 except for page 100, which is 100, so hundreds digit is 1 once.

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately. Maybe I can calculate how many times each digit (4 and 8) appears in the units place, then the tens place, and then the hundreds place. After that, I can sum them up for each digit and find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then an extra 8 pages. In each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So that's 48 times each for 4 and 8. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in these, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digits go from 0 (for 0-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times. So, for the tens place, each digit appears 10 times per 100 numbers. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each digit, that's 4 blocks * 10 = 40 times each in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nFirst, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, which is 10 numbers. Then, 1 for 411-420, and so on, up to 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Well, when the tens digit is 4, that would be from 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's 10 numbers, so the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, that's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. When the tens digit is 8, it's from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place: 4's are 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 = 50 times, and 8's are 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 9 = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times, so 4 is one more than 8 here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Let's see: from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't contribute. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each digit place again for both 4 and 8.\n\nUnits place:\n- For each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units for 4: 48 +1=49, same for 8:49.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 pages, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 times 100 is 400, so 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total tens place for 4: 40 +10=50, for 8:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, totals:\n4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188\n8:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)= 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages. When considering 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to check: Let me count how many times 4 appears in each position and 8 in each position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the problem as counting the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) and count how many 4's and 8's appear in each.\n\nUnits place:\n- As before, for 488 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, except possibly the last partial set. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, total 4's in units:48+1=49, same for 8's.\n\nTens place:\n- For each 100 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) have tens digits from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. When the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages. So, total tens place: 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+9=49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- For 488 pages, the hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position by considering how many times each digit appears in each position up to 488.\n\nAnother way is to calculate for each digit place, how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is given by:\n\nnumber = (N // 10) * 1 + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, for each digit in the units place, the count is (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0) when d !=0. But since we're dealing with digits 4 and 8, which are non-zero, this formula might work.\n\nWait, let me test it with N=488.\n\nFor units digit 4:\ncount = (488 //10) + (1 if (488 %10)>=4 else 0)\n488//10=48, 488%10=8, which is >=4, so +1. So total 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8:\ncount =48 + (1 if 8>=8 else 0)=48+1=49.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nThe formula is a bit more involved. The number of times digit d appears in the tens place up to N is:\n\nhigher = N // 100\ncurrent = (N //10) %10\nlower = N %10\n\nif d < current:\n    count = (higher +1)*10\nelif d == current:\n    count = higher*10 + (lower +1)\nelse:\n    count = higher*10\n\nBut wait, let's test this for d=4 and N=488.\n\nhigher =488//100=4\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\nFor d=4:\nSince 4 < current (8), count = (4+1)*10=5*10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\nSince d=8 == current=8, count =4*10 + (8+1)=40+9=49.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nThe formula is:\n\nif d ==0, it's a bit different, but for d=4 and d=8:\n\nhigher = N //1000\ncurrent = (N //100) %10\nlower = N %100\n\nif d < current:\n    count = (higher +1)*100\nelif d == current:\n    count = higher*100 + (lower +1)\nelse:\n    count = higher*100\n\nFor N=488:\nhigher=488//1000=0\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4\nlower=488%100=88\n\nFor d=4:\nd=4 == current=4, so count=0*100 + (88 +1)=89.\n\nFor d=8:\nd=8 > current=4, so count=0*100=0.\n\nWhich again matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, using these formulas, we can confirm that:\n\n- Units place: 49 each\n- Tens place: 50 for 4, 49 for 8\n- Hundreds place:89 for 4, 0 for 8\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me think about another way. Maybe I can manually count the number of 4's and 8's in a smaller range and see if my method works.\n\nFor example, let's take a book with 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's would there be?\n\nPage numbers:1-20.\n\nUnits place:\n4 appears at 4,14 => 2 times\n8 appears at 8,18 => 2 times\n\nTens place:\n4 appears at 40-49, but since we only go up to 20, it doesn't appear in the tens place.\n8 appears at 80-89, which is beyond 20, so 0 times.\n\nHundreds place:0 for both.\n\nSo total 4's:2, 8's:2, difference 0.\n\nUsing our formula:\n\nUnits place for 4: (20//10)=2, and 20%10=0, which is less than 4, so 2+0=2\nUnits place for 8:2+0=2\n\nTens place for 4: higher=0, current=2, so since 4>2, count=0*10=0\nTens place for 8: same, count=0\n\nHundreds place:0 for both.\n\nSo total 4's:2, 8's:2, difference 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test: 50 pages.\n\nUnits place:\n4:5 (4,14,24,34,44)\n8:5 (8,18,28,38,48)\n\nTens place:\n4:10 (40-49)\n8:10 (but 50 is the last page, so 80-89 is beyond, so 0? Wait no, 50 is the last page, so tens digit 4 appears at 40-49, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Tens digit 8 would be 80-89, which is beyond 50, so 0 times.\n\nHundreds place:0 for both.\n\nSo total 4's:5+10=15\n8's:5+0=5\nDifference:10.\n\nUsing our formula:\n\nUnits place:\n4:50//10=5, 50%10=0, so 5\n8:50//10=5, 50%10=0, so 5\n\nTens place:\n4: higher=50//100=0, current=(50//10)%10=5, since 4 <5, count=(0+1)*10=10\n8: higher=0, current=5, since 8>5, count=0*10=0\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nSo total 4's:5+10=15\n8's:5+0=5\nDifference:10. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for smaller numbers, so it's likely correct for 488 pages.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n### Units Place\n- Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages.\n- For 488 pages, there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages, contributing 48 occurrences of each digit.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one more 4 and one more 8.\n- Total 4's in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n- Total 8's in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n\n### Tens Place\n- Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n- For 488 pages, there are 4 complete sets of 100 pages, contributing 40 occurrences of each digit.\n- The remaining 88 pages (401-488) contribute 10 occurrences of 4 (440-449) and 9 occurrences of 8 (480-488).\n- Total 4's in tens place: \\(40 + 10 = 50\\)\n- Total 8's in tens place: \\(40 + 9 = 49\\)\n\n### Hundreds Place\n- The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n- Total 4's in hundreds place: \\(89\\)\n- Total 8's in hundreds place: \\(0\\)\n\n### Total Counts\n- Total 4's: \\(49\\) (units) + \\(50\\) (tens) + \\(89\\) (hundreds) = \\(188\\)\n- Total 8's: \\(49\\) (units) + \\(49\\) (tens) + \\(0\\) (hundreds) = \\(98\\)\n\n### Difference\n- The difference between the number of 4's and 8's is \\(188 - 98 = 90\\).\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\(\\boxed{90}\\)."

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately. Maybe I should look at the units place, tens place, and hundreds place individually.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive pages, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, from page 1 to page 480, how many sets of 10 are there? Well, 480 divided by 10 is 48. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 would appear 48 times each. But wait, we have 488 pages, so pages 481 to 488 would add an extra 8 in the units place for page 488. So, the units place for 4's is 48, and for 8's, it's 48 plus 1, which is 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, and the same for 8. Let me calculate how many hundreds we have in 488 pages. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488). So, for each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. That's 4 hundreds times 10, which is 40 for each digit. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once more (pages 440-449) and 8 appears once more (pages 480-488). Wait, no, actually, in the 400s, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit goes up to 8. So, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place once (440-449) and the digit 8 appears once (480-488). Therefore, in the tens place, 4's are 40 + 1 = 41, and 8's are 40 + 1 = 41 as well.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. From page 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so we can ignore that. From page 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2, and so on. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 41\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 41 + 89 = 178\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 41\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 41 + 0 = 90\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 178 - 90 = 88.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages, so units digit cycles 48 full times (48*10=480) and then 8 more pages (481-488). So, 4's in units place: 48 times. 8's: 48 (from 480) plus 1 (page 488) = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit. 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8. So, 4 appears once (440-449) and 8 appears once (480-488). So, 4's tens: 40+1=41, 8's tens: 40+1=41. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place. So, 8's hundreds: 0.\n\nAdding up: 4's total = 48+41+89=178, 8's total=49+41+0=90. Difference: 178-90=88.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place in the last partial hundred. Let me recount. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, there are 10 pages except the last one, which is only 8 pages (481-488). But wait, no, the tens digit is determined by the second digit. So, for 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit 1; ...; 480-488, tens digit 8. Each of these is 10 pages except the last one, which is 9 pages (480-488 is 9 pages, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred, not 10. Wait, no, in the tens place, each group of 10 pages has the same tens digit. So, from 480-489, the tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages. So, does that mean that in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred? But earlier, I thought it's 10 times because from 400-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8, each appearing 10 times except the last one which is 9. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place without breaking into hundreds. Let me try another approach.\n\nFor units digit: Each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial set. From 1-488, there are 488 numbers. The number of complete sets of 10 is 48 (since 48*10=480), with 8 remaining numbers (481-488). So, in units place, digits 0-9 each appear 48 times, and then digits 1-8 appear once more in the remaining 8 numbers. So, digit 4 appears 48 times in units, and digit 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nFor tens digit: Each digit 0-9 appears equally in the tens place every 100 numbers. From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488). In each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 times each for digits 0-9. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-8. Each tens digit from 0-8 appears 10 times, except the last one, which is 9 times (since 88 = 9*9 + 7? Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let me see: 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers), 411-420: tens digit 1 (10), ..., 480-488: tens digit 8 (9 numbers). So, in the tens place, digits 0-8 each appear 10 times except 8, which appears 9 times. Therefore, in the remaining 88 numbers, digit 4 appears 10 times, and digit 8 appears 9 times. So, total tens place for 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's tens were 41, but now it's 50. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast it.\n\nIn each full hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except the last one, which is only 9 times because 88 = 9*9 + 7? Wait, no, let me count properly.\n\nFrom 401-488, that's 88 numbers. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 9 times except for 0, which appears 10 times because 401-410 is 10 numbers. Wait, no, 401-410 is 10 numbers, so tens digit 0 appears 10 times. Then, 411-420 is 10 numbers, tens digit 1, and so on up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the remaining 88 numbers:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- Tens digit 1: 10 times (411-420)\n- ...\n- Tens digit 7: 10 times (471-480)\n- Tens digit 8: 9 times (481-488)\n\nWait, but 401-410 is 10 numbers, 411-420 is another 10, ..., up to 471-480 is 10, and then 481-488 is 8 numbers, but wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, not 9. Wait, 481 to 488 inclusive is 8 pages (481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the units place, but in the tens place, it's 8 for pages 480-488, but 480 is included in the previous set (471-480), so 480 has tens digit 8? Wait, no, 480 is part of 471-480, which is tens digit 7? Wait, no, 471-480: 471 has tens digit 7, 480 has tens digit 8? Wait, no, 480 is actually 480, so the tens digit is 8, right? Because 480 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, 0 units. So, 480 is part of the 480-488 range, which is tens digit 8. So, 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 pages, each with tens digit 8. Therefore, in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 numbers:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 10\n- Tens digit 1: 10\n- ...\n- Tens digit 7: 10\n- Tens digit 8: 9\n\nSo, digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 numbers (since 4 is one of the digits from 0-7), and digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from remaining) = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 41 and 41. So, which is correct? Let me check.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that in the 400s, the tens digit cycles 0-8, and each digit appears once, but that's incorrect. Each tens digit appears 10 times per hundred, but in the partial hundred, it's 10 times for digits 0-7 and 9 times for digit 8. So, yes, in the remaining 88 numbers, digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the 400s, the tens digit for 440-449 is 4, which is 10 times, so that's correct. Similarly, 480-488 is 9 times for 8. So, yes, 50 and 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\n- From 1-399, hundreds digit is 0,1,2,3, so 4 never appears.\n- From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit is only up to 4.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, adding up:\n\n- 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187\n- 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98\n\nWait, but earlier I had 178 for 4's and 90 for 8's, but now I'm getting 187 and 98. That's a big difference. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, let me recast everything properly.\n\nLet me approach each digit place separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n- Every 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, with 8 remaining pages (481-488).\n- So, 4 appears 48 times in the units place, plus 0 times in the remaining 8 pages (since the remaining pages are 481-488, which end with 8, so 488 is the last, but 481-488 don't have a units digit of 4 except possibly 484, which is within 481-488.\nWait, 481-488: units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 is in there, so units digit 4 appears once more. So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, 488 / 10 is 48 full cycles (1-480), and then 481-488 is 8 pages. In the first 480 pages, units digit 4 appears 48 times. In 481-488, units digit 4 appears once (page 484). So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 appears in the first 480 pages 48 times, and in 481-488, page 488 has units digit 8, so total units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so both units digits 4 and 8 appear 49 times? But that can't be right because in the first 480 pages, units digit 4 appears 48 times, and in 481-488, it's 484, so 49 total. Similarly, units digit 8 appears 48 times in 1-480, plus 488, so 49 total. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units 4's were 48 and 8's were 49. Now, I'm getting both as 49. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let's take a small example. From 1-10: units digits 4 appears once (page 4), 8 appears once (page 8). From 11-20: same, etc. So, up to 480, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 times each for 4 and 8 in units place. Then, from 481-488, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, both are 49 in units place.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought 4's units were 48 and 8's were 49. Actually, both are 49. So, that's a correction.\n\nTens place:\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nEach digit in the tens place cycles every 100 pages. In each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-400, there are 4 full hundreds, so each digit 0-9 appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digit cycles from 0-8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which appears 9 times.\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 pages. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except the last one (8) which appears 9 times because 481-488 is 8 pages, not 10.\n\nWait, no, 401-410 is 10 pages (401-410), 411-420 is another 10, ..., 471-480 is 10, and then 481-488 is 8 pages. So, the tens digits:\n\n- 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- 1: 10 times (411-420)\n- ...\n- 7: 10 times (471-480)\n- 8: 8 times (481-488)\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for those 8 pages. So, in the tens place, digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488.\n\nBut wait, from 401-488, the tens digits:\n\n- 0: 10\n- 1: 10\n- 2: 10\n- 3: 10\n- 4: 10\n- 5: 10\n- 6: 10\n- 7: 10\n- 8: 8\n\nSo, digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in 401-488, and digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in tens place were 49. Now, it's 48. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 1-400: each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in tens place.\n\nFrom 401-488: tens digits go from 0-8, with each digit 0-7 appearing 10 times, and 8 appearing 8 times.\n\nSo, digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in 401-488, so total 40 +10=50.\n\nDigit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in 401-488, so total 40 +8=48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's:50, 8's:48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-399: hundreds digit is 0,1,2,3, so 4 never appears.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, which appears 89 times (488 -400 +1=89).\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nNow, adding up:\n\n4's total = units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99+89=188\n\n8's total = units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0) = 49+48=97\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91\n\nWait, but earlier I had different numbers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nTens place: 4's=50, 8's=48.\n\nHundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nSo, 4's total=49+50+89=188\n\n8's total=49+48+0=97\n\nDifference=188-97=91\n\nBut earlier, when I thought units 4's were 48 and 8's 49, I got a different result. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recount the units place.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 pages, once. So, 488 /10=48 full cycles, which is 480 pages, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, which is 8 pages: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once in 484. So, total units 4's=48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, units 8's: in 1-480, 48 times. In 481-488, 488 has units digit 8, so total units 8's=48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400: 40 times each.\n\nFrom 401-488:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: each appear 10 times.\n- Tens digit 8: appears 8 times (pages 481-488).\n\nSo, digit 4 in tens place: 10 times in 401-488, so total 40+10=50.\n\nDigit 8 in tens place: 8 times in 401-488, so total 40+8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nDigit 4: 89 times (400-488).\n\nDigit 8: 0 times.\n\nSo, totals:\n\n4's:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units)+48 (tens)+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's tens were 49, but now it's 48. So, I must have made a mistake in the tens place calculation earlier.\n\nWait, let me think again about the tens place in 401-488.\n\nFrom 401-488, that's 88 pages. The tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nEach tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times because 481-488 is 8 pages.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages. Let's see:\n\n401-410:10 pages, tens digit 0\n\n411-420:10, tens digit1\n\n...\n\n471-480:10, tens digit7\n\n481-488:8 pages, tens digit8\n\nSo, from 401-480: 70 pages, with tens digits 0-7 each appearing 10 times.\n\nFrom 481-488:8 pages, tens digit8 appearing 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit0:10\n\n- Tens digit1:10\n\n...\n\n- Tens digit7:10\n\n- Tens digit8:8\n\nSo, digit4 in tens place:10 times.\n\nDigit8 in tens place:8 times.\n\nSo, total:\n\n4's tens:40+10=50\n\n8's tens:40+8=48\n\nTherefore, the correct counts are:\n\n4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nBut wait, the problem is a 488-page book, so page 488 is included. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, which is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 88, but now it's 91. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recount everything step by step.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 488 pages.\n\n- Units digit cycles every 10 pages.\n\n- 488 /10=48 full cycles, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8.\n\n- 48*1=48 for each.\n\n- Remaining 8 pages:481-488.\n\n- Units digits:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\n- So, 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n\n- Total units 4's:48+1=49\n\n- Total units 8's:48+1=49\n\nTens place:\n\n- From 1-400:4 hundreds, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in tens place.\n\n- So, 4*10=40 for each digit.\n\n- From 401-488:88 pages.\n\n- Tens digits go from 0-8.\n\n- Each tens digit from 0-7 appears 10 times.\n\n- Tens digit8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\n- So, digit4 in tens place:10 times.\n\n- Digit8 in tens place:8 times.\n\n- Total tens 4's:40+10=50\n\n- Total tens 8's:40+8=48\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- From 1-399: hundreds digit is 0,1,2,3, so 4 never appears.\n\n- From 400-488:89 pages, hundreds digit is 4.\n\n- So, 4's:89\n\n- 8's:0\n\nNow, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units)+48 (tens)+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88. So, where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nI think the mistake was in the tens place calculation. Initially, I thought that in the last partial hundred, digit8 in tens place appeared 9 times, but actually, it's 8 times because 481-488 is 8 pages, not 9. So, that's where the error was.\n\nTherefore, the correct difference is 91.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

I should calculate the number of times 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once, as does the digit 8. Therefore, the number of 4's and 8's in the units place should be the same. But wait, maybe I should check if 488 affects this.\n\nLet me think. The total number of pages is 488, so the last page is 488. The units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each complete set, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the same for 8's. But wait, the last 8 pages (481-488) include a 4 in the units place (484) and an 8 in the units place (488). So, that adds one more 4 and one more 8. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, same number in the units place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9, then repeats. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89). So, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many hundreds do we have? The book has 488 pages, so that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, no, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages, but each hundred is 100 pages. So, the first 400 pages are covered by 4 hundreds, and then we have 88 more pages. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens place has 10 4's and 10 8's. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Let's analyze the tens digit in this range. The tens digit in 401-488 goes from 0 to 8, but let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. From 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, our range starts at 401, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 pages (480-488), but wait, 480 is page 480, which is included, and 488 is the last page. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place from 401-488? It's from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. Wait, but in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, we have 10 4's (from 440-449) and 9 8's (from 480-488).\n\nWait, but earlier, in the first 400 pages, we had 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place. Now, in the remaining 88 pages, we have 10 more 4's and 9 more 8's. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., 8 for 481-490, but we stop at 488. So, for the tens digit being 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. For the tens digit being 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, yes, 10 4's and 9 8's in the tens place from 401-488. So, adding to the first 400 pages, which had 40 each, we get 50 4's and 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. Therefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89, and 8's is 0.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place, and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total number of 4's and 8's across all places.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 = 90, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place. Let me check again.\n\nWait, earlier, in the tens place, I had 50 4's and 49 8's. But when I added up the 4's, I included 50 from the tens place, which is correct. For 8's, I had 49 from the tens place, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let me re-examine the units place. From 1 to 488, how many 4's and 8's are there in the units digit?\n\nEach 10 pages, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-400, each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 each. Then, from 401-488, as I calculated, 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times (400-488), and 8's don't appear at all.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any digits. Each page number is considered once, and each digit is counted separately, so I think this is correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- There are 48 full sets of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 each.\n- The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n- Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- Four full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n- From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449) and 8 for 9 pages (480-488).\n- Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- The hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages (400-488).\n- The hundreds digit is never 8.\n- Total 4's: 89\n- Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n- 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should separate the counting based on the number of digits. Let me think.\n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers: these are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits are just 1 through 9, so each digit appears exactly once. So, how many 4's are there? Just one, on page 4. Similarly, how many 8's? Just one, on page 8. So, in the one-digit numbers, the count of 4's and 8's is equal, both being 1.\n\nNow, moving on to two-digit page numbers: these are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the two-digit numbers. The 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place.\n\n- In the tens place: The numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n- In the units place: The numbers are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 44 has two 4's, but since we're counting each occurrence, it's 9 times for the units place, but 44 contributes two 4's. Hmm, actually, each units place 4 occurs once per ten numbers, so from 10-99, there are 9 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 times. But wait, 44 has a 4 in both tens and units, so that's two 4's, but when we count the tens and units separately, we should count each occurrence. So, the tens place 4's are 10 (40-49), and the units place 4's are 9 (14,24,...,94). So total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nWait, but 44 is counted twice here, once in the tens and once in the units. But that's correct because 44 has two 4's, so each should be counted separately. So, 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nSimilarly, let's count the number of 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\n- In the tens place: The numbers are 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n- In the units place: The numbers are 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, but again, 88 has two 8's. So, when counting units place, it's 9 occurrences, but 88 contributes two 8's. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nWait, but 88 is counted twice here as well, once in the tens and once in the units, which is correct because it has two 8's. So, 10 + 9 = 19 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the count of 4's and 8's is both 19. So, the difference so far is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: these are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number has a hundreds place, tens place, and units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nLet me break this down by each digit place: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in each place.\n\n1. Hundreds place:\n   - The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n   - For 4's in the hundreds place, the numbers are 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - Now, let's consider the tens digit. The tens digit can be 0-9, but we need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n   - Let's break this down by hundreds:\n     - For hundreds digit 1 (100-199):\n       - The tens digit cycles from 0-9, so 4 appears in the tens place for 140-149, which is 10 numbers.\n     - For hundreds digit 2 (200-299):\n       - Similarly, 4 appears in the tens place for 240-249, another 10 numbers.\n     - For hundreds digit 3 (300-399):\n       - 4 appears in the tens place for 340-349, another 10 numbers.\n     - For hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n       - Here, the tens digit can go up to 8 because the last number is 488. So, the tens digit can be 0-8.\n       - So, the 4 in the tens place would be for 440-449. That's 10 numbers.\n       - Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers.\n   - So, total 4's in the tens place: 10 (for 100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40.\n\n3. Units place:\n   - Now, let's count the number of 4's in the units place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n   - For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit cycles from 0-9 every ten numbers.\n   - So, in each hundreds group, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens in that group.\n   - Let's calculate for each hundreds group:\n     - 100-199:\n       - From 100-199, each ten has one 4 in the units place (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194). There are 10 such tens (100-109, 110-119, ..., 190-199), so 10 occurrences.\n     - 200-299:\n       - Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. 10 occurrences.\n     - 300-399:\n       - 304, 314, ..., 394. 10 occurrences.\n     - 400-488:\n       - Here, the units digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten, but the hundreds group ends at 488, which is part of the 480-488 range.\n       - So, how many complete tens are there? From 400-488, the tens are 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. That's 9 complete tens (400-409 to 480-488). Wait, 400-409 is the first ten, then 410-419, ..., up to 480-488. So, how many complete tens? From 400-480, that's 9 tens (400-409 is the first, 410-419 is the second, ..., 480-489 would be the ninth, but since we only go up to 488, the last ten is incomplete. However, in the units place, for each ten, the units digit goes from 0-9, so in 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8, so the units digit 4 occurs once in this ten (484). So, total in 400-488: 9 complete tens (each contributing one 4 in the units place) plus one more in the incomplete ten (484). Wait, but actually, in each ten, regardless of how many numbers are there, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in 400-488, the number of complete tens is 9 (400-409 up to 480-488). Wait, 400-409 is the first ten, then 410-419, ..., 480-489. But since we stop at 488, the last ten is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, does that mean that in the units place, for each ten, the digit 4 appears once? Let's see: in 400-409, 404 has a 4 in units. Similarly, 414, 424, ..., 484. So, in each ten, there's exactly one 4 in the units place, regardless of how many numbers are in that ten. So, from 400-488, how many tens are there? Let's calculate: 400-409 is the first ten, then 410-419, ..., 480-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each ten has 10 numbers, so 89 / 10 = 8 full tens and 9 extra numbers. So, there are 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) and then the last partial ten is 480-488. In each of the 8 full tens, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 8 occurrences. In the partial ten (480-488), the units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total in 400-488: 8 + 1 = 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\n   - So, total 4's in the units place across all three-digit numbers:\n     - 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For 400-488, the units digit 4 appears once per ten, and there are 9 tens (from 400-409 up to 480-489), but since we only go up to 488, the last ten is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But in each ten, the units digit 4 appears once, regardless of how many numbers are in that ten. So, from 400-488, there are 9 tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 occurrences. Therefore, the total 4's in the units place would be 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\n1. Hundreds place:\n   - The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n   - Break it down by hundreds:\n     - For hundreds digit 1 (100-199):\n       - The tens digit cycles 0-9, so 8 appears in the tens place for 180-189, which is 10 numbers.\n     - For hundreds digit 2 (200-299):\n       - Similarly, 280-289, another 10 numbers.\n     - For hundreds digit 3 (300-399):\n       - 380-389, another 10 numbers.\n     - For hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n       - The tens digit can go up to 8 because the last number is 488. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. But wait, 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8, but how many numbers? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n   - So, total 8's in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\n3. Units place:\n   - Now, count how many times 8 appears in the units place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n   - For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit cycles from 0-9 every ten numbers.\n   - So, in each hundreds group, the number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens in that group.\n   - Let's calculate for each hundreds group:\n     - 100-199:\n       - From 100-199, each ten has one 8 in the units place (e.g., 108, 118, ..., 198). There are 10 such tens (100-109, 110-119, ..., 190-199), so 10 occurrences.\n     - 200-299:\n       - Similarly, 208, 218, ..., 298. 10 occurrences.\n     - 300-399:\n       - 308, 318, ..., 398. 10 occurrences.\n     - 400-488:\n       - Here, the units digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten, but the group ends at 488.\n       - How many complete tens are there? From 400-488, the tens are 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. That's 9 complete tens (400-409 up to 480-488). In each ten, the units digit 8 appears once. So, in each of these 9 tens, 8 appears once in the units place, so 9 occurrences.\n   - So, total 8's in the units place:\n     - 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, let me make sure. For 400-488, each ten (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488) has one 8 in the units place. Since there are 9 tens, that's 9 occurrences. So, yes, 39 in total.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across all page numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for one-digit numbers: 4 and 8 each appear once. Correct.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 4's and 8's each appear 19 times. Correct.\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n- For 4's:\n  - Hundreds place: 89 (400-488)\n  - Tens place: 40 (10 in each of 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 10 in 400-488? Wait, earlier I thought it was 40, but now I'm thinking, wait, no, in the tens place for 4's, it's 10 in each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and 10 in 400-488, so 10*4=40. Correct.\n  - Units place: 39. Correct.\n  - So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n- Tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39. Correct.\n- Units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39. Correct.\n- Total 8's: 39 + 39 = 78. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers was 39, but let me confirm.\n\nWait, in the units place for 4's in three-digit numbers, I had:\n\n100-199: 10\n200-299: 10\n300-399: 10\n400-488: 9\nTotal: 39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the calculations seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. In the three-digit numbers, for the hundreds place, 4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the total difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me think about how often each digit appears in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 each appear once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any extra in the last partial set. Wait, in the last 8 pages, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in 484, and the digit 8 appears once in 488. So, for the units place, 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, they are equal in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place: Similarly, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 pages. So, in 488 pages, how many complete sets of 100 are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete sets and then 88 extra pages. In each complete set of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 complete sets, that's 4 times 10 = 40 for each digit. Now, in the remaining 88 pages, which go from 400 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 440-449, that's 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear? From 480-488, that's 9 times because 488 is the last page, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, no, actually, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 times. So, in the tens place, 4's: 40 (from the complete sets) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. 8's: 40 (from complete sets) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49, so 4's are one more than 8's here.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place: For the hundreds digit, each digit from 1 to 4 appears 100 times each, except maybe the last one. Wait, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't count. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times. From 200-299, it's 2, appearing 100 times. From 300-399, it's 3, appearing 100 times. From 400-488, it's 4, appearing 89 times because 400-488 is 89 pages. Wait, no, 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? 89 times. How about 8? Well, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, 4's in hundreds place: 89, and 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 48 full times in 480 pages, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - **Total:** 49 4's, 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 40 times in 400 pages, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Pages 400-488 add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 4's, 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488), while 8 never appears.\n   - **Total:** 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\nSumming up:\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how to approach counting the number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference.\n\nMaybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That makes sense because each digit place can be analyzed individually to count how many times 4 and 8 appear. Let me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's think about the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in the units place, each digit appears once every 10 numbers. Now, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, in each block of 10 numbers, it appears once. Similarly, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nBut wait, the total number of pages is 488, which isn't a multiple of 10. So, I need to calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then handle the remaining numbers. Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 more numbers. \n\nIn each complete block, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers, which are 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these remaining numbers, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. That means the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) and then 1-9 for 10-99, each appearing 10 times. So, in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. But again, we need to adjust for the total number of pages, which is 488.\n\nLet's break it down. The number 488 can be divided into 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 ones. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think differently. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488) will have different numbers of tens digits.\n\nWait, actually, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) and then 1-9 for 10-99, each appearing 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, the tens digits go from 0 (for 101-109) and then 1-9 for 110-199, each appearing 10 times. The same pattern repeats for 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488.\n\nSo, for each hundred block, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 400 pages would be four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Then, from 401-488, that's another 88 pages.\n\nSo, in the first four hundreds (1-400), each digit 4 and 8 appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred, so 4 times 10 = 40 for 4's and 4 times 10 = 40 for 8's.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining 88 pages from 401-488. The tens digits here go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). \n\nEach of these tens digits appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears only 8 times (since 481-488 is 8 numbers). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It's in the block 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, in the tens place for 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total tens place 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50. Tens place 8's: 40 + 8 = 48. So, the difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's zero. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nTherefore, hundreds place 4's: 89. Hundreds place 8's: 0. The difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nUnits place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. Difference: 0.\n\nTens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 48. Difference: +2.\n\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. Difference: +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because 91 seems a lot more than I initially thought.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. Let me see: from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so 89 times. That's correct. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 50 for 4's and 48 for 8's, so a difference of +2.\n\nIn the units place, both 4's and 8's were 49 each, so no difference.\n\nSo total difference is 89 (from hundreds) + 2 (from tens) = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. For each tens digit, how many times does 4 appear? In the 440s, that's 10 times. For 8, it's in the 480s, which is 8 times because we only go up to 488. So, that's correct: 10 vs. 8, so +2.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so no difference.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's, so +89.\n\nAdding up: 89 + 2 = 91.\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me try another approach: instead of calculating the difference per digit place, maybe calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nLet me compute total number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's think: every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once here, making total 49. Similarly for 8's, same count. So units place is correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 times. From 1-400, that's four hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450 (10 times) and 8 in 481-488 (8 times). So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, 40 +8=48 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +48 +0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Every 10 numbers, each digit (0-9) appears once in the units place.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 complete blocks, each contributing one '4' and one '8'.\n   - Remainder 8 numbers (481-488) add one '4' and one '8'.\n   - Total '4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total '8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each hundred block (e.g., 1-100) has each digit (0-9) appearing 10 times in the tens place.\n   - 400 pages mean 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 '4's and 10 '8's.\n   - From 401-488, '4' appears 10 times (441-450), and '8' appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total '4's: 4\u00d710 +10 = 50\n   - Total '8's: 4\u00d710 +8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is '4', appearing 89 times.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total '4's: 89\n   - Total '8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- '8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference**: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nThus, there are 91 more '4's than '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how digits are distributed in these numbers.\n\nMaybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can add them up and find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., each digit from 0-9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for each ten numbers, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of the 48 sets, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 times each. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in total, units place gives us 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. So, no difference there.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears ten times in a block of 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 80-89, also 10 times. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So that's 4 times 10, which is 40 fours and 40 eights.\n\nNow, the remaining pages are from 401-488. Let's look at the tens place here. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in this range. Specifically, 401-410 has tens digit 0, 411-420 has 1, and so on up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last part is 481-488, which has tens digit 8. Wait, but 481-490 would be tens digit 8, but we stop at 488, so how many numbers have 8 in the tens place here? From 480-489, but since we're only up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Wait, no, 480 is part of the 480-489 range, but in our case, it's 481-488. So, 481-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers is that? From 481 to 488 is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each. So that's 8 fours? Wait, no, wait. The tens digit is 8, so we're looking for how many times 8 appears in the tens place. So, from 480-489, the tens digit is 8, but in our case, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, that's 8 eights in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, but here, the last partial hundred contributes only 8 eights. So, total eights in the tens place would be 4*10 + 8 = 48. But wait, let me check.\n\nWait, actually, in the hundreds 401-500, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-489, which is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480 is included in 401-488? No, 480 is page 480, which is within 401-488. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 9 eights in the tens place. Therefore, total eights in the tens place would be 4*10 (from the first four hundreds) plus 9, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 481-488 is 8 numbers, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the tens place: in each hundred, 40-49 has 10 fours. So, in 1-100, 101-200, etc., each contributes 10 fours. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours: 40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours. So total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total fours in tens place: 4*10 +10=50.\n\nSo, for tens place: fours=50, eights=49. So, fours are more by 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about eights in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place: fours=89, eights=0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal fours=49+50+89= 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal eights=49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours minus 98 eights, which is 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188-98=90. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me verify each step again.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nEach ten numbers, 1-10, 11-20, etc., each digit 0-9 appears once in units place. So, for 488 pages, how many tens are there? 48 full tens (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in each full ten, 1 four and 1 eight. So, 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in the last 8 pages, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units fours:48+1=49, units eights:48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 fours in the tens place (40-49), and 10 eights (80-89). So, for four full hundreds (1-400), that's 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The fours in the tens place occur in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. The eights in the tens place occur in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 eights.\n\nSo, total tens fours:40+10=50, tens eights:40+9=49. So, fours have 1 more in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFours occur from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Eights never occur in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. So, eights=0.\n\nAdding up:\n\nFours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\nEights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has exactly one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n   - **Total Units: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.**\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred (e.g., 1-100) has 10 '4's (40-49) and 10 '8's (80-89) in the tens place.\n   - Four full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - In 401-488, '4's in the tens place occur in 440-449 (10 '4's), and '8's occur in 480-488 (9 '8's).\n   - **Total Tens: 50 '4's and 49 '8's.**\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4's appear in 400-488, totaling 89 '4's.\n   - No '8's appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total Hundreds: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.**\n\n4. **Total Count:**\n   - **'4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **'8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in all the page numbers.\n\nMaybe I should start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. Then, I can sum them up for all places and find the difference between the total number of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So in each set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place goes from 0 to 9. So in each set, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and an extra 8 pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). So in each of the 48 complete sets, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. That gives me 48 occurrences for both 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, for the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), I need to check the units digits. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So in these, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, that's the same, so maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, no, because 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So yes, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. So the difference here is zero.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check. Let me see: from 1 to 480, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 48 times in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So total for units place: 48 +1 =49 for both. So units place contributes 49 each, so difference is zero.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each set of 100 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nNow, 488 pages mean there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So in the full hundreds, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place each, so 4*10=40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), let's see the tens digits. From 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; 421-430, it's 2; 431-440, it's 3; 441-450, it's 4; 451-460, it's 5; 461-470, it's 6; 471-480, it's 7; and 481-488, it's 8. Wait, no, actually, 481-488 would have tens digit 8 only up to 480, but 481-488 is 8 tens, so the tens digit is 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's still 8 in the tens place for 481-488.\n\nWait, perhaps I should structure this differently. The pages from 401 to 488 can be broken down into 401-410, 411-420, ..., 481-488. Each of these decades has 10 pages except the last one, which has 8 pages (481-488).\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4 (10 times)\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8 (8 times)\n\nSo in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (from 441-450), and 8 appears 8 times in the tens place (from 481-488). So total in the tens place:\n\nFor 4's: 40 (from the full hundreds) +10=50\nFor 8's: 40 (from the full hundreds) +8=48\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, in the full hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 for 4's and 4*10=40 for 8's. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, 4's in the tens place occur once in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8's occur in 481-488, which is 8 times.\n\nWait, but from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8, but each cycle is 10 pages except the last one, which is 8 pages. So for the tens digit, 4 appears once in 441-450 (10 times) and 8 appears in 481-488 (8 times). So yes, 4's in tens place: 40+10=50, 8's:40+8=48.\n\nSo in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times. So the difference here is 50-48=2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. So 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So the difference here is 89-0=89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49-49=0\n- Tens place:50-48=2\n- Hundreds place:89-0=89\n\nTotal difference: 0+2+89=91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So yes, 89 times.\n\nIn the tens place, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times, and 8 in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So 4's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) +10=50, 8's:40 +8=48. So difference 2.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so 0 difference.\n\nSo total difference is 89 (hundreds) +2 (tens) +0 (units) =91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: for the hundreds digit, only pages 400-488 have a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 pages, so 89 times. So that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, in the 400-488 range, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So 4's:10, 8's:8, so difference 2.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so no difference.\n\nSo total difference is 89 +2=91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about page numbers, sometimes the digit counts might overlap in different places. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nLet me calculate total number of 4's:\n\nUnits place: as before, 49 times.\n\nTens place:50 times.\n\nHundreds place:89 times.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\nUnits place:49 times.\n\nTens place:48 times.\n\nHundreds place:0 times.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that matches. So the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can think of each digit place separately again, but perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times, and 8 for 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the full hundreds (1-400), each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place, so 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 40 times. Then in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 8 times. So total 4's in tens place:40+10=50, 8's:40+8=48.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct, and the difference is 91.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place up to page 480.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place up to page 400.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 occurrences of 4 (441-450) and 8 occurrences of 8 (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n   - Difference: 50 - 48 = 2.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have the hundreds digit as 4, occurring 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\n**Total Difference:**\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: 2\n- Hundreds: 89\n- **Total:** 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference.\n\nI should probably start by considering the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately for each digit. That way, I can systematically count how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nLet me start with the 4's. I'll count how many times 4 appears in the units place, then in the tens place, and then in the hundreds place.\n\nFirst, units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. How many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each full set, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. Therefore, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each set of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many full sets of 100 are there in 488? That's 4 full sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra numbers (401-488). In each full set, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Wait, let me check: 401-409: tens digit is 0; 410-419: tens digit is 1; ... up to 480-488: tens digit is 8. So, in this range, does 4 appear in the tens place? No, because 401-409 have tens digit 0, and then the next set where tens digit is 4 would be 440-449, but 440-449 is within 401-488? Wait, 440 is less than 488, so actually, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 (from the full hundreds) plus 10, totaling 50.\n\nWait, but hold on: 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So yes, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. I'll count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place: The tens digit is 8 for 10 consecutive numbers in each set of 100. So, in each full set of 100, that's 10 times. There are 4 full sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. The tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 (from 1-480, each 10 numbers) plus 0 in 481-488, total 48.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 (40), plus in 401-488, 440-449 is 10, so total 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (488), total 49.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds contributing 40, plus in 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in the remaining 88 numbers, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

That way, I can systematically count how many 4's and 8's appear in each place across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once (at 4) and 8 appears once (at 8). \n\nNow, how many such groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 full groups of 10, and then an additional 8 pages (481 to 488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, except for the last partial group where only 8 digits (1 to 8) appear once each.\n\nWait, no, actually, each group of 10 has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 full groups, that's 48 times each for 4 and 8. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. Hmm, that's interesting, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check that again. From 1 to 480, that's 48 groups of 10. Each group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. So, same count in units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place over 100 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see. From 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, it's from 80-89, which is another 10 times.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each hundred block, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nBut wait, in the last hundred, from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, does that affect the count? Let me think. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, does that mean the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last hundred?\n\nWait, no, actually, from 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the tens place, for the last hundred (400-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, now, how many hundreds do we have? From 1-99: 1 hundred, 100-199: another, 200-299: another, 300-399: another, and 400-488: the fifth. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. In the fifth hundred (400-488), 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 4 appears 4 hundreds * 10 + 10 = 50 times. Wait, no, wait. Each hundred from 1-99, 100-199, etc., up to 300-399, each has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place. Then, the last hundred (400-488) has 10 for 4 and 9 for 8. So, total tens place:\n\n4's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the last hundred, so 50.\n\n8's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last hundred, so 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 1-399, each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds: 4*10=40 for 4's, and 4*10=40 for 8's. Then, from 400-488, 4's in the tens place are from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, making total 50 for 4's. For 8's, from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, making total 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's there. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Only in 400-488. That's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 times. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The highest hundreds digit is 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total in hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, units place: 49 for both 4 and 8, that seems correct because from 1-488, each digit 0-9 appears 48 full times in the units place, plus in the last partial group (481-488), 4 and 8 each appear once, so 48 + 1 = 49 each.\n\nTens place: For 4, 50 times; for 8, 49 times. That seems correct because in the first four hundreds, each has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 40 each, and then in the last hundred, 10 more for 4 and 9 more for 8, making 50 and 49.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding up: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 for 4's, and 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 for 8's. Difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, does each number from 400-488 have a hundreds digit of 4? Yes, because 400 is 4 in the hundreds, 401 is 4, up to 488, which is still 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, yes, the hundreds place contributes 89 to 4's and 0 to 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, so 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place? From 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last hundred, plus 40 from the first four hundreds, making 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the tens place, in the last hundred, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times, plus 40 from the first four hundreds, making 50. Correct.\n\nSo, I think the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately, maybe units, tens, and hundreds. That seems like a good approach.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive page numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit, like 4 or 8, appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nBut wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, that means there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, there's an extra 4 (at page 484) and an extra 8 (at page 488). So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Hmm, so in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, so 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 481 has 1, 482 has 2, ..., 484 has 4, and 488 has 8. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8. So yes, units place: 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (1-9), 1 (10-19), ..., 9 (90-99). So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each hundred, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (40-49) and 8 for 10 pages (80-89). So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSince there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. Now, what about the last partial hundred, from 401-488? The tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 pages. Similarly, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 +1 = 9). Wait, no, 480-488 is actually 9 pages: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nTherefore, total tens place 4's: 4 * 10 + 10 = 50\nTotal tens place 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. That's a difference of 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, it's 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 488 pages. Each 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8 in the units place. 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 of each digit. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so one 4 and one 8. So, 48 +1=49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. 4 hundreds: 4*10=40 each. Then, the last 88 pages (401-488) have tens digits from 0 to 8. For 4 in tens place: 440-449 is 10 pages. For 8: 480-488 is 9 pages. So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +9=49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8's: 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 +50 +89= 188\n8's:49 +49 +0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 4's. Correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place, I thought 8's were 49, but let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages (480-488). So, 4's in tens place:10, 8's:9. So, in the last partial hundred, 4's:10, 8's:9. So, total tens place 4's:40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49. So, correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For each digit place, count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider each digit position separately.\n\nLet me try another approach for units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place:\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)*1 + min(488 mod 10,4-0) = 48*1 +1=49\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)*1 + min(488 mod 10,8-0)=48*1 +1=49\n\nTens place:\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)*10 + extra for the remaining pages.\nFrom 1-400: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40\nRemaining pages:488-400=88\nIn the tens place, how many 4's in 401-488: the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40 +10=50\nSimilarly, number of 8's in tens place:4*10=40\nRemaining pages:401-488\nTens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). So, 40 +9=49\n\nHundreds place:\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since we're dealing with hundreds, it's 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's\nNumber of 8's: 0, since 800 is beyond 488\n\nSo, adding up:\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, but I'm getting the same result, so I think it's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method to be sure. Maybe list out the counts for each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\nFrom 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? Every 10 pages, so 488//10=48, with remainder 8. So, 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so one 4 (484). So, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: same logic, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\nFrom 1 to 488, how many 4's in tens place? Each hundred has 10 pages with 4 in tens place (40-49). So, 4 hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in tens place: Each hundred has 10 pages with 8 in tens place (80-89). So, 4*10=40. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\nFrom 1 to 488, 4 appears in hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 4's.\n\n8's in hundreds place: 0, since 800 is beyond 488.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's:49+50+89=188\n8's:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488): one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49; 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 sets, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Last partial hundred (401-488):\n     - 4's: 10 (440-449).\n     - 8's: 9 (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50; 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's: 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8's: 0 times.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how the digits 4 and 8 appear in each place: units, tens, and hundreds. I should probably count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately and then compare them.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, every 10 pages, the digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in every block of 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, pages 1-10 have 1 in the units place once, 2 once, and so on up to 0 once (on page 10). So, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nWait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, that means there are 48 full blocks of 10 pages each, and then an additional 8 pages (481 to 488). In each full block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48. Similarly, the number of 8's in the units place would also be 48. But then, we have the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488). Let me check if any of these pages have a 4 or 8 in the units place. Pages 481 to 488: the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, we have one more 4 (page 484) and one more 8 (page 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the 8's are 48 + 1 = 49 as well. So, for the units place, both digits appear 49 times. That means the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred block. For example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, 1 for pages 11-20, up to 9 for pages 91-100. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Let me see how many hundreds we have in 488 pages. It's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the four hundreds, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 4 times 10 = 40 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place 10 times in each hundred, so that's another 40 times.\n\nNow, let's check the remaining pages from 401 to 488. The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8. Specifically, pages 401-410 have a tens digit of 0, 411-420 have 1, and so on up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digits go up to 8 (pages 481-488). So, in this range, the tens digit is 8 for pages 481-490, but since we only have up to 488, that's 8 pages: 481-488, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages. Wait, but actually, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages: 480-488. Wait, no, 480 would be in the 400s, but 480 is page 480, which is in 401-488. So, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but since we only have up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, but 480 is included in the 401-488 range, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 more times in this partial hundred. Therefore, the total number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from the four hundreds) plus 9 = 49. \n\nWhat about the digit 4 in the tens place in the remaining pages? Looking at 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, up to 8 for 481-490. So, does the tens digit ever equal 4 in this range? Yes, pages 440-449 have a tens digit of 4. So, that's 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. Therefore, the number of 4's in the tens place in this partial hundred is 10. So, adding that to the 40 from the four hundreds, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on, 440-449 is 10 pages, so that's correct. So, 4's in the tens place: 50, and 8's in the tens place: 49. So, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, let me check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 would have a hundreds digit of 4. So, the hundreds digit cycles every 100 pages. So, for each hundred, the hundreds digit is fixed. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from page 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. Therefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The highest hundreds digit is 4 (for 400-488). So, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. The difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me add up the counts from each place.\n\nFor the units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. Difference: 0.\n\nFor the tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49. Difference: 1.\n\nFor the hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. Difference: 89.\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the number of 4's and 8's in the tens place.\n\nIn the full hundreds (1-400), each hundred contributes 10 times the digit in the tens place. So, for 4, it's 10 times in each hundred, so 4 hundreds give 40 times. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's 10 more, making it 50 for 4's. For 8's in the tens place, in the full hundreds, it's 10 times per hundred, so 4 hundreds give 40 times. In the partial hundred, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 480 is included and 488 is the last page). So, that's 9 more, making it 49 for 8's. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, that's 9 pages, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, the tens place gives a difference of 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all, so that's a difference of 89.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, each of those pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for the 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no page where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the total difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the units place. I thought that in the units place, both 4's and 8's appeared 49 times each, but let me confirm.\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of complete decades (blocks of 10): 48 (since 48*10=480), with 8 remaining pages (481-488).\n\nIn each complete decade, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 times each.\n\nIn the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, total units digits: 48 +1=49 for 4, and 48 +1=49 for 8. So, correct, units place difference is 0.\n\nSo, the total difference is indeed 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete decades: 48 (480 pages).\n   - Remaining pages: 8 (481-488).\n   - **4's:** 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - **8's:** 48 + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n   - **Difference:** 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (400 pages).\n   - Remaining pages: 88 (401-488).\n   - **4's:** 4*10 + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n   - **8's:** 4*10 + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n   - **Difference:** 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have a hundreds digit of 4.\n   - **4's:** 89 (400-488).\n   - **8's:** 0.\n   - **Difference:** 89.\n\n**Total Difference:** 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place, I know that every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for every set of 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. That means for each digit, the number of times it appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 pages in 488 pages. Let me calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. So, each digit, including 4 and 8, appears 48 times in the units place. But wait, 488 is not a multiple of 10, so there are 8 extra pages beyond the 480th page. These extra pages are 481 to 488. So, I need to check the units digits of these extra pages. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so neither 4 nor 8 appears in the units place in these extra pages. Therefore, the count remains 48 for both 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9 (but actually, page 1 is 01 if we consider two digits, but in reality, page numbers start at 1, so maybe I should adjust for that). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently. Each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has exactly 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for the tens place, the number of times each digit appears is equal to the number of hundreds in 488, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then the remaining 88 pages (401-488). So, for each digit, in the tens place, we have 4 full hundreds contributing 10 times each, so 4*10=40. Now, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each set of 10 pages. Let's see, 401-410: tens digit is 0; 411-420: 1; 421-430: 2; 431-440: 3; 441-450: 4; 451-460:5; 461-470:6; 471-480:7; and 481-488:8. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears only 8 times (since 481-488 is only 8 pages). Wait, no, actually, each set from 401-410 is 10 pages, so 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 times), 411-420:1 (10 times), and so on up to 471-480:7 (10 times). Then 481-488:8 (8 times). So, for the tens digit in the remaining 88 pages, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. Therefore, for the digit 4 in the tens place, in the remaining pages, it appears 10 times (from 441-450). Similarly, for 8, it appears 8 times in the tens place in the remaining pages. So, total for tens place: 4*10=40 plus 10 for 4, so 50 times for 4; and for 8, 4*10=40 plus 8, so 48 times. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in the full hundreds, each digit appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 hundreds give 40 times for each digit. Then in the remaining 88 pages, as I said, 441-450 contributes 10 times for 4, and 481-488 contributes 8 times for 8. So, total for 4 in tens place: 40 +10=50; for 8: 40 +8=48.\n\nWait, but wait, does the remaining 88 pages include 401-488, which is 88 pages. Let me check: 488 - 400 = 88, so yes. So, in the tens place, for 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, in the tens place, for 401-488, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 441-450, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 481-488, which is 8 times. So, yes, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times in the tens place of the remaining 88 pages. Therefore, total for 4 in tens place: 40 +10=50; for 8: 40 +8=48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1,2,3, or 4. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:48+50+89=187\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place:48\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:48+48+0=96\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's:187-96=91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages. Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, as 488//10=48 with a remainder of 8. The extra 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so no additional 4 or 8 in units place. So, units:48 each.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit. So, 4 hundreds contribute 40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0-8. For 4, it's 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 more. For 8, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 more. So, 4:40+10=50; 8:40+8=48.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:48+50+89=187\n\nTotal 8's:48+48+0=96\n\nDifference:187-96=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 96. The difference is 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how digits are counted in page numbers. I remember that for such problems, it's often useful to count the occurrences of each digit in each place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nSo, maybe I should consider each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position and how many times 8 appears. Then, I can sum them up for each digit and find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a particular digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nBut wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, and then from 1 to 8, each appears one more time. So, for the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and the digit 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times as well. Hmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. That means the difference in the units place is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100 pages. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Similarly, from 100-199, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each, and so on.\n\nLet me calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place. First, I'll find out how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages. Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then an incomplete hundred from 400-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 complete hundreds, each digit appears 4 * 10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's look at the incomplete hundred from 400-488. The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digits go from 0 (for 400-409), 1 (410-419), up to 8 (480-488). Each of these digits appears 9 times except for 8, which appears 9 times as well because 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, actually, from 400 to 488, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 9 times, right? Because each set like 400-409 is 10 pages, but 480-488 is only 9 pages. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, from 400 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but each tens digit actually appears 9 times. Because for each tens digit, say 0, it's 400-409, which is 10 pages, but since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, no, actually, 400-409 is 10 pages, 410-419 is another 10, and so on up to 470-479, which is 10 pages, and then 480-488 is 9 pages. So, the tens digits from 0 to 7 each appear 10 times (from 400-479), and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). So, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but I'm looking for the tens digit, so in the incomplete hundred (400-488), how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let me list it out. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, for the incomplete hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place overall, the digit 4 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from incomplete hundred) = 50 times. The digit 8 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from incomplete hundred) = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times, so 4 is one more than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, let's see, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, it's 1, 200-299 it's 2, 300-399 it's 3, and 400-488 it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- For hundreds digit 0: pages 1-99, which is 99 pages, but the hundreds digit is 0 for all these, so 0 appears 99 times? Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 only when there are three digits, but page numbers from 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, so the hundreds digit is 0 for all pages from 1-99, but in terms of digit count, how does that work? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, actually, when considering the hundreds place, only pages from 100 onwards have a hundreds digit. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit; their hundreds digit is effectively 0, but since we're only considering actual printed digits, maybe we shouldn't count those. So, for the hundreds place, the digit appears only from page 100 onwards.\n\nSo, from 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times (from 100 to 199 inclusive).\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, appearing 100 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, appearing 100 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages).\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? 89 times.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the count for 8 in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, 4 is 89 more than 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nNow for the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (for 4) minus 98 (for 8), which equals 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488\n\nUnits digit cycles every 10 pages. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 * 1 = 48 for each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (since 48 * 10 = 480, so 481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear one more time, making it 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nTotal pages: 488\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds (0-399) give 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit. Then, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each tens digit, except the last one, it's 10 pages. So, for 400-488, the tens digits are 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., 8 (480-488). Each of 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (as in 440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit 1, 100 times\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit 2, 100 times\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit 3, 100 times\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit 4, 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears here. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I counted the hundreds place correctly. Because from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, which is correct. And 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (as in 440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (from 1 to 480).\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 49\n   - Total 8's in units place: 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place for the first 400 pages.\n   - From 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 50\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{90}"

That way, I can count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each position and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place.

Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, and then for the last 8 numbers, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, and the digit 8 also appears 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set, 8 appears once more (in 488), so actually, 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. Hmm, no, wait, that's not right. Because from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in the units place in that last partial set. So, total units place 4's are 48, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place gives 4's:48, 8's:49.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Each full set of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full sets would contribute 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once more, making 8's total 49. So yes, units place: 48 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers, and same for 8.\n\nNow, how many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is less than 500, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of these four hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So, 4 appears 4*10=40 times, and 8 appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place from the full hundreds.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see, 401-409: the tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8. 410-419: tens digit is 1, so no. 420-429: tens digit is 2, no. 430-439: tens digit is 3, no. 440-449: tens digit is 4, so that's 10 times. 450-459: tens digit is 5, no. 460-469: tens digit is 6, no. 470-479: tens digit is 7, no. 480-488: tens digit is 8, so that's 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).\n\nWait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, adding that to the previous counts: 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of those 9 numbers, right? So, 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, tens place gives 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8? Well, in the hundreds place, 8 would appear in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the positions.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 fours, 49 eights.\n\nTens place: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187.\n\n8's: 49 + 49 = 98; 98 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 8 in the units place.\n   - **Total:** 48 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - The last partial hundred (401-488) adds 10 fours (440-449) and 9 eights (480-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, contributing 89 fours.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total:** 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 98 = 89\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8. But wait, the first page is 1, so does that affect the count? Let me see: from 1 to 10, 4 appears once (page 4) and 8 appears once (page 8). So, each block of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8. \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). So, in the units place, each complete block has one 4 and one 8. So, 48 blocks would give 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Now, the extra 8 pages from 481 to 488: looking at the units digits, that's 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, there's a 4 (page 484) and an 8 (page 488). So, that adds one more 4 and one more 8. Therefore, in the units place, total 4's are 48+1=49, and 8's are 48+1=49. So, same number in units place.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), etc., up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times in each block of 100. \n\nSo, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? Well, 4*100=400, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks would give 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's in the tens place. \n\nNow, the remaining pages after 400 are from 401 to 488. Let's look at the tens digit in this range. The numbers 401-410 have a tens digit of 0, 411-420 have 1, 421-430 have 2, 431-440 have 3, 441-450 have 4, 451-460 have 5, 461-470 have 6, 471-480 have 7, and 481-488 have 8. \n\nWait, let me correct that. Actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). But let's check how many numbers are in each tens group. \n\n- 401-410: 10 numbers, tens digit 0\n- 411-420: 10 numbers, tens digit 1\n- 421-430: 10 numbers, tens digit 2\n- 431-440: 10 numbers, tens digit 3\n- 441-450: 10 numbers, tens digit 4\n- 451-460: 10 numbers, tens digit 5\n- 461-470: 10 numbers, tens digit 6\n- 471-480: 10 numbers, tens digit 7\n- 481-488: 8 numbers, tens digit 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many 4's and 8's do we have here? \n\nLooking at the tens digit 4: it occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. \n\nLooking at the tens digit 8: it occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 8's in the tens place. \n\nTherefore, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), we have 10 4's and 8 8's in the tens place. \n\nAdding this to the earlier 40 from the complete blocks, total 4's in the tens place are 40 +10=50, and 8's are 40 +8=48. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 48. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nWait, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99 (since they are two-digit numbers), 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. \n\nHow about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. \n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places. \n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. \n\nTo find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, subtract: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 and one 8, so total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full blocks of 100, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, we have 10 4's and 8 8's in the tens place, so total 50 4's and 48 8's. That adds up correctly.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's. That's correct because only pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, and 8 doesn't appear there.\n\nAdding up: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188 4's.\n\nFor 8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 97 8's.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, 188 - 97 is 91? Let me subtract: 188 - 90 = 98, then subtract 7 more, so 91. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) plus 8 extra pages.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (400 pages) plus 88 extra pages.\n   - In the extra 88 pages, 4's appear 10 times and 8's appear 8 times.\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's appear in pages 400-488, contributing 89 4's.\n   - 8's do not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Total 8's = 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Let me think about how the digits 4 and 8 appear in each place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nMaybe I should tackle each digit place separately. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nSo, for the units place, how many 4's are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. That means there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Plus, in the last partial cycle of 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more. So total 4's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So 48 times from the full cycles, and in the last partial cycle, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once. Therefore, 48 + 1 = 49. So in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So far, the difference is zero.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, with each digit from 0 to 9 appearing 10 times in each block of 100. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, same with 8.\n\nLet me calculate how many hundreds are there in 488. Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So there are 4 full hundreds and a partial hundred of 88 pages. \n\nFor the digit 4 in the tens place: in each full hundred, 4 appears 10 times, so 4 full hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial hundred (pages 401 to 488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in the range 440-449, which is 10 times. So total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the tens place: in each full hundred, 8 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. In the partial hundred, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Wait, no, actually, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 is 480, 481, ..., up to 488, so that's 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So that's 9 times. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. That means 4's are ahead by 1 so far.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it changes less frequently. From page 1 to 99, the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't appear. From page 100 to 199, the hundreds digit is 1, and so on.\n\nSo, in 488 pages, the hundreds digit goes through 1, 2, 3, and 4. Specifically, from 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, 200-299: 2, 300-399: 3, and 400-488: 4.\n\nNow, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times. That's a significant difference.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once. So 48 +1 = 49. Correct.\n- Similarly for 8, same logic: 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place: 4*10=40. Then, the partial hundred is 400-488. The tens digit cycles from 0-8. So, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50. Correct.\n- For 8 in tens place: 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40. The partial hundred is 400-488, so 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times. So 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So 89 times. Correct.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place in this book. Correct.\n\nTotal counts:\n- 4: 49 +50 +89 = 188\n- 8: 49 +49 +0 = 98\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** 48 full cycles of 10 pages contribute 48 occurrences, plus 1 in the last 8 pages, totaling 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** 4 full hundreds contribute 40, plus 10 in the partial hundred, totaling 50.\n   - **8's:** 4 full hundreds contribute 40, plus 9 in the partial hundred, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** 89 occurrences from pages 400-488.\n   - **8's:** 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me think about each place where the digits 4 and 8 can appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive page numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 is in 4 and 8 is in 8. This pattern repeats every 10 pages. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 more pages. In each complete set, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, the count of 4's is 48, and the same for 8's. But wait, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding that, units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 488 is the last page. Let me check again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. So, units place contributes equally, 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Let's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last). Let me see, in 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nIn 401-410, the tens digit is 0. 411-420, it's 1. 421-430, it's 2. 431-440, it's 3. 441-450, it's 4. 451-460, it's 5. 461-470, it's 6. 471-480, it's 7. 481-488, it's 8. So, in the tens place from 401-488, 4 appears once (441-450) and 8 appears once (481-488). But wait, 441-450 is 10 numbers, so the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. Similarly, 481-490 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 pages. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). Therefore, total in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit. So, 4 appears 10 times per hundred, 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, so total 50. For 8, in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 40, and then in 401-488, 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times, so total 48. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case, since the book has 488 pages. The hundreds digit is 1 from 1-99, 2 from 100-199, 3 from 200-299, and 4 from 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, no, 300-399 is hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 is hundreds digit 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, correct.\n\nTens place: 4's have 50, 8's have 48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's have 89, 8's have 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up 4's: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Correct.\n\nAdding up 8's: 49 + 48 = 97. Correct.\n\n188 - 97 = 91. So, 4's are printed 91 more times than 8's.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just make sure I didn't double-count any digits or miss any ranges.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, adding to the 40 from the complete hundreds, 4's get 50, 8's get 48. Correct.\n\nUnits place: Each 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one, and then 8 more pages where 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 48 + 1 = 49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Analyze Each Digit Place Separately:**\n   - **Units Place:** For every 10 pages, both 4 and 8 appear once. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 each. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8. Total: 49 each.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each hundred contributes 10 instances of each digit. For 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 40 each. The remaining 88 pages add 10 more 4's (441-450) and 8 more 8's (481-488). Total: 50 for 4, 48 for 8.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times. The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place. Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n2. **Sum the Counts:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 91 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is a three-digit number, so maybe I should think about how many digits each page number has and how often the digits 4 and 8 appear in each position.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the units place, each digit, including 4 and 8, should appear once every 10 numbers. But wait, when we're dealing with page numbers starting at 1, the first set is 1-10, so the units digits go from 1 to 0. Hmm, so maybe the 0 doesn't count as a digit in the units place for page 10, but actually, page 10 does have a 0 in the units place. Wait, no, page 10 is the 10th page, so its number is 10, which has a 1 in the tens place and a 0 in the units place. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages, except maybe the first page, which is 1, so page 1 has 1 in units place, page 2 has 2, up to page 9, then page 10 has 0. So, for each set of 10 pages, the units digit cycles through 0-9, but starting from 1 for the first page. Wait, no, actually, the first 10 pages are 1-10, so the units digits go from 1 to 0, which is a bit different. So, in the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages, but for the first 10 pages, the units digits are 1-0, so 0 appears once, and the digits 1-9 each appear once. So, for each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten numbers. So, in the tens place, each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages. So, for 488 pages, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place? Let me calculate that.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages. So, in 488 pages, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times 1 for 4's and 48 times 1 for 8's. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so in units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nNow, let's move to the tens place. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages. So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, for each hundred, 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds would give 4*10=40 times each. Then, we have the remaining 88 pages (401-488). Wait, no, 400 is the end of the fourth hundred, so 401-488 is 88 pages. Wait, but from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. Let me think: from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; ... up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digits in 481-488 are 8. So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488?\n\nWait, let's break it down. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but we only go up to 488, so the last group is 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, for each tens digit from 0-8, how many times does it appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 times (but 401-410 is 10 pages, so tens digit 0 appears 10 times). Similarly, 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 times, and so on up to 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so 481-488 is 8 pages. So, for tens digit 8, it appears 8 times in the tens place in 481-488.\n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digits:\n\n- 0: 10 times\n- 1: 10 times\n- 2: 10 times\n- 3: 10 times\n- 4: 10 times\n- 5: 10 times\n- 6: 10 times\n- 7: 10 times\n- 8: 8 times\n\nWait, but that's only 88 pages (401-488). Let me check: 488 - 400 = 88 pages, so that's correct. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times (in 441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (in 481-488). So, in the tens place, for the entire book:\n\n- Digit 4: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in 441-450, so total 50 times.\n- Digit 8: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 8 in 481-488, so total 48 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds (1-400), each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, as I thought before. So, in 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- Tens digit 1: 10 times (411-420)\n- ...\n- Tens digit 8: 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 10 times in 441-450, and digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488. So, total in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, right? So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 times\n- 8's: 0 times\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, so the total number of 4's is 188 and 8's is 97. So, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 appear once. 488 pages / 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8. So, 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's in units: 48 +1=49, 8's: 48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, with 0 appearing 10 times (401-410), 1 appearing 10 times (411-420), ..., 8 appearing 8 times (481-488). So, for 4 in the tens place, in 401-488, it appears 10 times (441-450). So, total 4's in tens: 40 +10=50. For 8's in tens place, in 401-488, it's 8 times, so total 40 +8=48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0 times. That's correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units)+48 (tens)+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 groups.\n   - Each group contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 occurrences.\n     - 4's: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Pages 401-488: Tens digits 0-8.\n     - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99: Hundreds digit is 0.\n   - Pages 100-199: Hundreds digit is 1.\n   - Pages 200-299: Hundreds digit is 2.\n   - Pages 300-399: Hundreds digit is 3.\n   - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4 (89 times).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how digits are used in each position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately. Maybe I can calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each of those 48 sets, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So that's 48 times each. Now, for the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding that, the units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4 and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is included, so maybe I need to check that again.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. When I have 488 pages, the last page is 488, so the units digits go up to 8. So, the units place for 4 appears 48 times (from each set of 10) plus one more at 484, making it 49. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times plus one more at 488, making it 49 as well. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each 100-page block. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, each block of 100 pages contributes 10 instances (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). Similarly for 8, it's 80-89, 180-189, etc. Now, how many complete 100-page blocks are there in 488 pages? There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488).\n\nIn each 100-page block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so for 4 blocks, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per block, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (440-449), and 8 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (480-489), but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, that's a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-489). But since we're stopping at 488, the tens digit 8 is present from 480 to 488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for the tens place: 40 (from the blocks) + 10 = 50 times for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 times for 8.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Each 100-page block has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 4 blocks, that's 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. For 8, it's 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 pages. Therefore, the total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nOkay, so so far, in the units place, both 4 and 8 have 49 each, and in the tens place, 4 has 50 and 8 has 49. Now, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, that's correct because 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, and before that, it's 3 for 300-399, and so on. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the total occurrences for 4 and 8.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, so 4 appears 188 times and 8 appears 98 times. The problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so that would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 appear once each in units. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 for 4 and 1 for 8. So, 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units total: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place: Each 100 pages, 10 occurrences for each digit in the tens place. 4 blocks of 100, so 4*10=40 for 4 and 4*10=40 for 8. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For 4 in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 pages. For 8 in tens place: 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 pages. So, 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place, so 0.\n\nTotal for 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal for 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I should handle each place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the digits in the units place cycle from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. That means, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 pages, and the same goes for 8. So, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nWell, the total number of pages is 488, so the number of complete sets of 10 is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). But wait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each complete set of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 pages. Similarly, for 8's, it's 48 times 1 plus any 8's in the remaining 8 pages.\n\nLooking at the remaining 8 pages, which are pages 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in the units place, there's an 8 in page 488. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the number of 8's is 48 plus 1, which is 49. So, in the units place, 8's appear one more time than 4's.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Each complete set of 10 pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Since there are 48 complete sets, that's 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the 8 appears once in the units place (page 488), but the 4 doesn't appear because the units digits go up to 8, which is less than 10. So, yes, 48 4's and 49 8's in the units place. So, 8's are one more than 4's in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nSo, how many hundreds do we have in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and so does 8. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digits here go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in this partial hundred.\n\nWe need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this range. Let's break it down:\n\n- Pages 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- Pages 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- Pages 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- Pages 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- Pages 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- Pages 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- Pages 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- Pages 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- Pages 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in this partial hundred, the tens digit is 4 in pages 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in pages 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nWait, but pages 481-488 are only 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, not 10. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nSo, total in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial hundred) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from partial hundred) = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times. So, 4's are two more than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards. So, in the hundreds place, each digit from 1-4 appears 100 times each, but let me check.\n\nWait, actually, for a 488-page book, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, each hundreds digit from 1 to 3 appears exactly 100 times, and 4 appears 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nWait, but the hundreds digit is only the first digit, so each page from 100-199 has hundreds digit 1, 200-299 has 2, etc. So, the number of times each hundreds digit appears is:\n\n- 1: 100 times (100-199)\n- 2: 100 times (200-299)\n- 3: 100 times (300-399)\n- 4: 89 times (400-488)\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times, and the digit 8 doesn't appear at all in the hundreds place because the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences in each place.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 4's and 49 8's. That seems correct because in the last 8 pages, 8 appears once in the units place.\n\nTens place: 50 4's and 48 8's. That also seems correct because in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's. Correct because 4 is the hundreds digit from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90\n\nHmm, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me check that again.\n\nIn the tens place, for the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 pages (440 to 449 inclusive). So, 10 times. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480 to 488). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 pages, not 8. Let me recount:\n\n480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, not 8. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred, not 8. That changes things.\n\nSo, correcting that:\n\nIn the partial hundred (401-488):\n\n- Tens digit 4: 10 times (440-449)\n- Tens digit 8: 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, total in the tens place:\n\n4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (partial) = 50\n8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (partial) = 49\n\nSo, now the total 8's in the tens place is 49, not 48.\n\nSo, recalculating the totals:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\n8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nWait, that's different. So, earlier I thought the tens place for 8's was 8, but it's actually 9 because 480-488 is 9 pages. So, the total 8's in the tens place is 49, making the total 8's 98. So, the difference is now 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make another mistake. Let me recount the number of pages in the last partial hundred.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, that's 88 pages. So, 401 is the first page, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 401 + 1 = 88 pages.\n\nIn the tens place, when the tens digit is 8, it's from 480 to 488. Wait, but 480 is included in the 401-488 range. So, 480 is page 480, which is within 401-488. So, pages 480-488: 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 pages, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages in the partial hundred.\n\nSo, the total 8's in the tens place is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nAnd 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nWait, but I think I made another mistake. Let me check the hundreds place again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, which is correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no 4. So, 48 4's in units place.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 pages, the units digit is 8 in page 488, so one more, making it 49.\n\nSo, units place: 48 4's, 49 8's.\n\nTens place: 4's: 50, 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place: 4's:89, 8's:0\n\nSo, total 4's:48+50+89=187\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:187-98=89\n\nSo, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the tens place correctly?\n\nIn the tens place, for the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nFor each tens digit, how many times does it appear?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 pages)\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 pages, not 9. So, the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, not 9. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times in the partial hundred, not 9.\n\nWait, that's a mistake. So, pages 481-488: 481,482,...,488. That's 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, not 9. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times in the partial hundred.\n\nSo, correcting that:\n\nIn the tens place, 4's:10 times (441-450)\n\n8's:8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, total in the tens place:\n\n4's:40 +10=50\n\n8's:40 +8=48\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place is 48, not 49.\n\nSo, now, total 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:48\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+48=97\n\nAnd 4's:\n\n- Units:48\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:48+50+89=187\n\nDifference:187-97=90\n\nWait, so now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 9 pages, but now I'm seeing it's 8 pages. Let me count the number of pages from 480 to 488.\n\nWait, 480 is included in the 401-488 range, right? So, 480 is page 480, which is part of the 401-488 pages. So, pages 480-488: 480,481,...,488. How many pages is that?\n\n488 - 480 +1 =9 pages. So, it's 9 pages, meaning the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 481-488 is 8 pages, but 480 is included, so it's 9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 8's in the partial hundred:9\n\nThus, total 8's in tens place:40+9=49\n\nSo, total 8's:49(units)+49(tens)+0=98\n\n4's:48+50+89=187\n\nDifference:187-98=89\n\nWait, but now I'm getting 89 again. So, I think the confusion is whether 480 is included in the 401-488 range. Since 480 is greater than 401, it is included. So, 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages.\n\nTherefore, the correct count is 9 times in the tens place for 8's in the partial hundred.\n\nSo, the total 8's in the tens place is 40+9=49.\n\nThus, total 8's:49+49=98\n\n4's:187\n\nDifference:187-98=89\n\nSo, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I count the tens digit for 480-488, it's 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred.\n\nTherefore, the total 8's in the tens place is 40+9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49(units)+49(tens)=98\n\n4's:187\n\nDifference:187-98=89\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, but after correcting the count, it's 89. So, the correct difference is 89.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total pages: 488.\n   - Complete sets of 10: 48 sets, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488): units digits 1-8.\n   - 4's: 0 additional.\n   - 8's: 1 additional (page 488).\n   - Total units: 48 4's, 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete sets of 100: 4 sets, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - Tens digits cycle 0-8.\n     - 4's: 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8's: 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total tens: 50 4's, 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Digits 1-4 appear in the hundreds place.\n   - 4's: 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8's: 0 times.\n   - Total hundreds: 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n   - 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Let me think about the digits in each position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI think I should count the number of times the digit 4 appears in each position separately and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. So, that's 48 times. But wait, the last group is from 481 to 488, which is only 8 numbers. In this group, the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once here as well. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, for each complete set of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, which is 48 sets of 10, that's 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block would be 440-449, right? So, how many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 40-49: that's 10 numbers.\nFrom 140-149: another 10.\nFrom 240-249: another 10.\nFrom 340-349: another 10.\nFrom 440-449: another 10.\nSo, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4. This happens from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400-488. So, the number of times 4 appears in the hundreds place is 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 in each of those, so 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4, but let's check. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, so 48 times. Then from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that block. So, how many such blocks?\n\nFrom 80-89: 10 numbers.\nFrom 180-189: 10.\nFrom 280-289: 10.\nFrom 380-389: 10.\nFrom 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\nWait, so that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, total tens place 8's would be 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 49 times.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, 8 in the hundreds place. This would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's:98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Then, 4's in tens place: 50, and units:49. So, 89+50=139, plus 49 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any edge cases. For example, when counting units digits, did I correctly account for all 4's and 8's? Let me think: for units digits, 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the last group from 481-488, which has a 4 in 484, so that's one more, totaling 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place, same logic: 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, plus the last group having 488, which is an 8 in the units place, so 49. Correct.\n\nFor tens place, 4's: from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's from 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8's in hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, 8's:98. Difference:90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, which is correct because 488-400+1=89. But when counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 440-449 as a block, which is correct because that's within 488.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, 444 would have a 4 in hundreds, tens, and units place. But when I'm counting each digit separately, that's fine because each occurrence is counted in its respective place.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place.\n     - From 1 to 480, there are 48 such groups, contributing 48 '4's.\n     - From 481 to 488, '4' appears once (at 484).\n     - Total units place '4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 '4's.\n     - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - Total tens place '4's: 5 * 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n     - Total hundreds place '4's: 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Similar to '4', '8' appears once every 10 numbers.\n     - From 1 to 480, 48 '8's.\n     - From 481-488, '8' appears once (at 488).\n     - Total units place '8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n     - There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 40 '8's.\n     - The last block is 480-488, contributing 9 '8's.\n     - Total tens place '8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n     - Total hundreds place '8's: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8' in the page numbers. \n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about the different digit places separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nMaybe I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the counts to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the same goes for 8. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra pages. In each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So that's 48 times each. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So adding those, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, no difference here.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds and then 88 pages extra. In each complete hundred, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (from 400 to 488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440 to 449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 times. Similarly, how about 8? From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488), so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for all those pages, right? So from 480 to 489, the tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 times. Wait, but 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in each of those. So, the count for 8 in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages is 9, and for 4, it's 10. So adding that to the previous 40, the total for 4 in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8, it's 40 + 9 = 49. So, 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So yes, 10 vs. 9. So that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be where 8 is in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 89 times for 4 and 0 times for 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the counts for each digit.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, subtracting the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, earlier I thought in the tens place, 4's were 50 and 8's were 49, but when I added up, I included hundreds place correctly. Let me go through each digit place again to make sure.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks, so 48 times each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have 4 at 484 and 8 at 488, so +1 each. So, 48 + 1 = 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. 4 hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 each.\n- Remaining 88 pages (400-488):\n  - 4 in tens place: 440-449, 10 times.\n  - 8 in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page).\n- So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think if I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all those. So that's correct. But wait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is a lot more than 8's. So, the difference is mainly from the hundreds place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by counting each digit place separately and then summing.\n\nWait, another way: Let's think of each digit place separately.\n\nUnits digit:\n- For each digit from 0-9, each appears equally in the units place over the range. So, for 488 pages, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times, plus an extra for the remaining 8 pages if the digit is \u22648. Wait, but 488 mod 10 is 8, so digits 0-8 will have one extra occurrence. So, for 4 and 8, they are \u22648, so each appears 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nTens digit:\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (400 pages) and 88 pages. So, in the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (from 400 to 488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for each digit 0-8, how many times does it appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each digit d from 0 to 8, the number of times it appears in the tens place is 10 times for d=0 to d=7, and 9 times for d=8 (since 480-488 is 9 pages). So, for 4 in the tens place: 10 times (440-449). For 8 in the tens place: 9 times (480-488). So, total for 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. For 8 in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n- The hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, 4 appears 89 times (from 400 to 488), and 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - **Total Units Place:** 49 each.\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contains 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (400-488) add 10 more 4's (440-449) and 9 more 8's (480-488).\n   - **Total Tens Place:** 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times from 400-488.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total Hundreds Place:** 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately. Maybe I should handle the units place, tens place, and hundreds place individually.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive pages, the digits in the units place cycle from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each complete set, we get one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 each. Now, for the extra 8 pages (pages 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, in the units place, total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and total 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so in the units place, they are equal. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. Similarly, from 100-199, it's the same, and so on. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times. How many hundreds do we have here? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have four hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred, but it's not complete. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider each digit place separately. For the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times every 100 pages. So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 88 pages (400-487) plus page 488. Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 pages. Hmm, maybe I should calculate it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place up to 488. For the tens digit, the number of times a digit d appears is determined by how many times the tens place cycles through 0-9. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 10 times for each digit. So, for 400 pages, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 times each digit in the tens place. Then, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, from 400-488, how many times does each digit appear?\n\nFrom 400-409: tens digit is 0, appears 10 times.\n410-419: tens digit 1, 10 times.\n420-429: tens digit 2, 10 times.\n430-439: tens digit 3, 10 times.\n440-449: tens digit 4, 10 times.\n450-459: tens digit 5, 10 times.\n460-469: tens digit 6, 10 times.\n470-479: tens digit 7, 10 times.\n480-488: tens digit 8, 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 pages).\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, each tens group from 400-409 is 10 pages, 410-419 another 10, and so on until 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 4 appears once in the 400-488 range, specifically in 440-449, which is 10 pages. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 pages, so the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place from 400-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: for 400-488, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times. Then, for the first 400 pages, as each hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would contribute 4*10=40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8 in the tens place. So, total in the tens place: 40 (from 0-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 times for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 times for 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check that again. From 0-99, tens digits 0-9 each appear 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in 0-99, same for 8. Similarly, 100-199: same, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times. So, for each hundred, 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, from 400-488, as we saw, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. So, 50 vs 49, so 4 appears once more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so 0 in the hundreds place, but since we're only considering digits 4 and 8, those don't appear in the hundreds place until page 100.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n200-299: hundreds digit is 2, same.\n300-399: hundreds digit is 3, same.\n400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears in the hundreds place for each page from 400-488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Since 800-899 would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds *10=40 each. Then, from 400-488, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times, and 480-488 is 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times. So, total in tens place: 40+10=50 for 4, 40+9=49 for 8. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. 8's:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 times. Correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place was 49 each, but then the tens place had 50 for 4 and 49 for 8, and hundreds place 89 for 4, 0 for 8. So, 49+50+89=188, 49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the units place was equal, but the tens and hundreds place make up the difference. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, yes, 10 vs 9, so 4 appears once more in the tens place beyond the 400 pages.\n\nSo, adding up, the difference is indeed 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n   - Each set contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8' in the units place.\n   - Total from complete sets: 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - Remaining pages (481-488): '4' appears once (484), '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 '4's and 48 + 1 = 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - For 400 pages (4 hundreds), each digit appears 40 times.\n   - From 400-488:\n     - '4' appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 '4's and 40 + 9 = 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488 (89 pages), '4' appears 89 times.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Total Count:**\n   - '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 '4's - 98 '8's = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should split this into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers and analyze each part separately.\n\nLet me start by considering one-digit page numbers. These are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for one-digit numbers, the count of 4's is 1 and the count of 8's is also 1. That means in the one-digit numbers, there are no more 4's than 8's.\n\nNext, I should look at two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Now, here, each digit can be considered separately. Let's think about how many times the digit 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place: The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 10 to 99, it's 9 times (since 44 is already counted in the tens place, but wait, no, in the units place, it's every 10 numbers, so 10 times? Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so 4 appears once in each set of ten. So from 10 to 99, that's 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). Wait, but 40-49 is the 4th set, so does that mean 4 appears 9 times in the units place? Wait, no, because in each set of ten, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once per set. So from 10 to 99, that's 9 sets (10-19 is the first, 20-29 the second, etc.), so 9 times in the units place. But wait, 40-49 is the fourth set, but in the units place, 44 would be counted in both tens and units. Wait, but when I'm counting the tens place, I already counted 40-49 as 10 times for the tens digit. Now, for the units digit, in each set of ten, 4 appears once, so from 10 to 99, that's 9 times (10-19: 14, 20-29:24, ..., 90-99:94). So 9 times. So total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times. For the units place, 4 appears once in each ten, so 9 times (since 10-99 is 90 numbers, 9 sets of ten). So 10 + 9 = 19 times 4 appears in two-digit numbers.\n\nSimilarly, let's count the number of 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nUnits place: In each set of ten, 8 appears once, so from 10-99, that's 9 sets, so 9 times. So total 8's would be 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nWait, so in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. So the difference here is zero.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For units place in two-digit numbers, 4 appears in 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 times, right? Because 40-49 is 10 numbers, but 44 is counted in both tens and units. So units place is 9 times, and tens place is 10 times, so total 19.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 times in units place, and 10 times in tens place (80-89). So 19 times total.\n\nSo in two-digit numbers, 4's and 8's are equal. So no difference so far.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Wait, but 488 is a three-digit number, so we need to consider up to 488.\n\nLet me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nI think I should break this down by each digit place: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in each place.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but when hundreds digit is 4, the tens and units digits are limited up to 88.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to split into two parts: numbers from 100 to 399, and from 400 to 488.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, numbers from 100 to 399.\n\nHundreds place: 1, 2, 3. So, in the hundreds place, 4 doesn't appear here, so no 4's in hundreds place from 100-399.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Since there are 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), but wait, no, from 100-399, that's 3 hundreds. Wait, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. So 3 sets.\n\nIn each set, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149 in 100-199). So 3 sets \u00d7 10 = 30 times in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: Similarly, in each hundred, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 10 times per hundred. So 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 times in the units place.\n\nSo total 4's from 100-399: tens place 30, units place 30, so 60.\n\nNow, let's consider numbers from 400 to 488.\n\nHundreds place: Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so in 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive, which is 89 numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nTens place: Now, let's look at the tens digit in 400-488.\n\nThe tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last number). So for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nWait, but actually, in the tens place, 4 appears when the tens digit is 4. So in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nEach tens digit from 0 to 8 appears how many times?\n\nFrom 400-488, the number of numbers is 89, as above.\n\nEach tens digit (0-8) appears 10 times except for the last one if 89 isn't a multiple of 10. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full decades (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full decades (each of 10 numbers) and then 9 more numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers: 400-409 is 10, 410-419 is another 10, ..., up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total 8 full decades (80 numbers) plus 9, making 89.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place in 400-488.\n\nThe tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449. So that's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nBut wait, 488 is the last number, so 440-449 is fully included. So 10 times in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: Now, in 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place.\n\nIn each set of ten numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So from 400-488, how many full sets of ten are there?\n\nWell, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full decades (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nIn each of the 8 full decades, 4 appears once in the units place (like 404, 414, etc.), so 8 times.\n\nIn the last partial decade, 480-488, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which is one more 4.\n\nSo total units place 4's: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo in 400-488, 4's in the hundreds place: 89, tens place: 10, units place:9. So total 4's in 400-488: 89 + 10 +9 = 108.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is always 4, so that's 89 times. Then, in the tens place, only 440-449 have 4 in the tens place, which is 10 times. In the units place, in each decade, 4 appears once, so from 400-488, that's 9 decades (400-409, ..., 480-488), but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so in the units place, 4 appears once in each of the 9 decades? Wait, no, 400-409 is 10 numbers, so 404 is one. Similarly, 410-419: 414, and so on up to 480-488: 484. So that's 9 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 9 decades (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so it's a partial decade. So in each full decade (400-409, etc.), the units digit 4 appears once, and in the last partial decade, 480-488, it also appears once (484). So total units place 4's: 8 full decades \u00d71 +1 =9.\n\nSo total 4's in 400-488: hundreds=89, tens=10, units=9, total 108.\n\nNow, let's sum up all 4's from 1-99 and 100-488.\n\nFrom 1-99: 19 (as calculated earlier).\n\nFrom 100-399: 60.\n\nFrom 400-488: 108.\n\nSo total 4's: 19 + 60 + 108 = 187.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-99, 19 4's. From 100-399, 60 4's. From 400-488, 108 4's. So total 19 +60=79, plus 108 is 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same ranges.\n\nStarting with 1-99: as before, 19 8's.\n\nFrom 100-399: Let's calculate 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 100-399, so hundreds digit is 1,2,3. So no 8's in hundreds place.\n\nTens place: In each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 8 appears in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 3 hundreds \u00d710=30 times in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: In each hundred, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So 10 times per hundred. So 3 hundreds \u00d710=30 times in the units place.\n\nSo total 8's from 100-399: 30 (tens) +30 (units) =60.\n\nNow, from 400-488: Let's count the 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, so hundreds digit is 4, so no 8's here.\n\nTens place: The tens digit can be 0-8. So 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, the tens digit is 8, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but actually, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nUnits place: In 400-488, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. Let's see how many full decades there are.\n\nFrom 400-488, as before, it's 89 numbers. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so 8 appears once per decade.\n\nNumber of full decades: 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. That's 9 decades, but the last one is partial (480-488). So in each full decade, 8 appears once, and in the partial decade, 488 is included, so that's another 8.\n\nWait, but 480-488 includes 488, which has units digit 8, so that's one more.\n\nWait, let's count:\n\nFrom 400-409: 408\n410-419:418\n420-429:428\n430-439:438\n440-449:448\n450-459:458\n460-469:468\n470-479:478\n480-488:488\n\nSo that's 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo units place 8's:9.\n\nTens place 8's:9 (from 480-488).\n\nSo total 8's in 400-488: tens=9, units=9, total 18.\n\nSo total 8's from 1-488:\n\nFrom 1-99:19\nFrom 100-399:60\nFrom 400-488:18\nTotal:19+60=79, plus18=97.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 19+60+18=97.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, in 400-488, the tens place 8's are from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nUnits place: as above, 9 times.\n\nSo 9+9=18.\n\nSo total 8's:19+60+18=97.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought from 100-399, 8's were 60, which seems correct: tens=30, units=30.\n\nWait, but let me make sure.\n\nIn 100-399, for 8's:\n\nTens place: in each hundred, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each is 10 numbers, so 3 hundreds \u00d710=30.\n\nUnits place: in each hundred, 108,118,...,198; 208,218,...,298; 308,318,...,398. Each hundred has 10 numbers, so 3\u00d710=30.\n\nSo yes, 30+30=60.\n\nSo 100-399:60 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488:18 8's.\n\nSo total 8's:19+60+18=97.\n\nWait, but 19+60=79, plus18=97.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought 4's were 187, 8's are 97.\n\nSo the difference would be 187-97=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting 4's.\n\nWait, 4's from 1-99:19.\n\nFrom 100-399:60.\n\nFrom 400-488:108.\n\nTotal:19+60=79+108=187.\n\n8's:19+60+18=97.\n\nSo difference:187-97=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the 400-488 range for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nIn 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times.\n\nTens digit 4:440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\nUnits digit 4: in each decade from 400-409, 410-419,...,480-488.\n\nIn each full decade (400-409, etc.), units digit 4 appears once, so 8 full decades (400-409 to 470-479) give 8 times, and in 480-488, units digit 4 appears at 484, so 1 more. So total units digit 4's:9.\n\nSo total 4's in 400-488:89+10+9=108.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in 400-488: tens digit 8:480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nUnits digit 8: in each decade, once, so 9 times.\n\nTotal 18.\n\nSo 8's total:19+60+18=97.\n\nSo difference:187-97=90.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, is there a possibility that I missed some 4's or 8's? Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position across all page numbers.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each position from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (48 full decades in 480 numbers, plus 8 more numbers). So 48 \u00d71=48, plus 1 more if the last partial decade includes 484. Wait, 488 is the last number, so 480-488 includes 484, so units place 4's:48+1=49.\n\nWait, but this approach might not be accurate because page numbers start at 1, not 0. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, but maybe I should use a formula or a systematic way.\n\nWait, perhaps using the method where for each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFor units place:\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nNumber of complete decades:48 (since 48\u00d710=480). So in each complete decade, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So 48\u00d71=48 for 4's, 48\u00d71=48 for 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488): check if 484 and 488 are included.\n\n484 has 4 in units place, so that's one more 4.\n\n488 has 8 in units place, so that's one more 8.\n\nSo total units place:\n\n4's:48+1=49.\n\n8's:48+1=49.\n\nSo units place: 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears equally in the tens place. The number of complete centuries is 4 (since 400 numbers make 4 centuries). In each century, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So for 4 and 8, each appears 4\u00d710=40 times.\n\nBut wait, we have 488 numbers, so beyond 400, we have 88 more numbers (401-488). Wait, actually, the tens place cycles every 100 numbers. So for 488 numbers, the number of complete hundreds is 4 (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is less than a full hundred.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\nFor the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in each position up to 488.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to number N can be calculated as:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100: floor(N/100). For each complete group, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So for 488, floor(488/100)=4 complete groups. So 4\u00d710=40 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining numbers after 400: 488-400+1=89 numbers (400-488).\n\nIn these 89 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last number). So for the tens digit, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, and each digit appears a certain number of times.\n\nThe number of times each digit appears in the tens place from 400-488:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times (e.g., 400-409: tens=0, 410-419: tens=1, etc., up to 470-479: tens=7). So 8 digits (0-7), each appearing 10 times: 8\u00d710=80.\n\n- For tens digit 8: it appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 9 times.\n\nSo in the remaining 89 numbers, 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (when tens digit=4, i.e., 440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo total tens place:\n\nFor 4's:4 complete groups \u00d710=40, plus 10 from 440-449: total 50.\n\nFor 8's:4 complete groups \u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488: total 49.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent with my earlier count. Wait, earlier I thought 4's in tens place were 10 in 400-488, but according to this, it's 10 from 440-449 plus the 40 from the complete groups, making 50.\n\nWait, but in the earlier approach, I had 400-488 as 89 numbers, and in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449). But according to this, it's 50 times.\n\nWait, that can't be right. There's a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the total counts.\n\nWait, actually, the complete groups are 1-400, so 400 numbers. From 1-400, the tens digit cycles 0-9 in each hundred, so each digit appears 10 times per hundred, so 4\u00d710=40 times for each digit in the tens place up to 400.\n\nThen, from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last number). So in this range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo total tens place counts:\n\nFor 4's:40 (from 1-400) +10 (from 401-488)=50.\n\nFor 8's:40 (from 1-400) +9 (from 401-488)=49.\n\nSo total 4's in tens place:50.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place:\n\n4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n8's: in hundreds place, from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 800-899 isn't included. So in hundreds place, 8's appear 0 times.\n\nWait, but in our earlier approach, we considered 1-99, 100-399, and 400-488. So in hundreds place, 4's appear in 400-488, which is 89 times, and 8's don't appear in hundreds place anywhere because the book only goes up to 488.\n\nSo total 4's in hundreds place:89.\n\n8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nSo now, let's sum up all 4's:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:50.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 187. Hmm, discrepancy here.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nWait, so difference would be 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 187-97=90 as well. So perhaps the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I had 187 4's and 97 8's, difference 90.\n\nIn the second approach, using digit places, I have 188 4's and 98 8's, difference 90.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct answer is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check where the discrepancy is.\n\nIn the first approach, from 1-99:19 4's.\n\nFrom 100-399:60.\n\nFrom 400-488:108.\n\nTotal:19+60=79+108=187.\n\nIn the second approach, using digit places:\n\nUnits:49.\n\nTens:50.\n\nHundreds:89.\n\nTotal:49+50=99+89=188.\n\nSo why the difference?\n\nAh, because in the first approach, from 1-99, we counted 19 4's, but in the digit place approach, units and tens place from 1-99 would be:\n\nUnits: from 1-99, units digit 4 appears 9 times (4,14,...,94).\n\nTens: from 1-99, tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n\nSo total 19, which matches.\n\nBut in the digit place approach, units place for 4's is 49, which includes 1-488.\n\nSimilarly, tens place is 50, which includes 1-488.\n\nSo perhaps the first approach had a miscalculation in the 400-488 range.\n\nWait, in the first approach, from 400-488, 4's were 108, but in the digit place approach, it's 89 (hundreds) +10 (tens) +9 (units) =108. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the digit place approach, units place is 49, which includes 1-488, so 4's in units place:49.\n\nSimilarly, tens place:50.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\nSo total 4's:188.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I had 187. So where's the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps in the first approach, I didn't count the 4 in 400-488 correctly. Wait, let me recount.\n\nFrom 1-99:19 4's.\n\nFrom 100-399:60.\n\nFrom 400-488:108.\n\nTotal:19+60=79+108=187.\n\nBut in the digit place approach, it's 49+50+89=188.\n\nSo there's a discrepancy of 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a 4 somewhere.\n\nWait, let's check the units place in the first approach.\n\nFrom 1-99:9 4's in units place.\n\nFrom 100-399:30 4's in units place.\n\nFrom 400-488:9 4's in units place.\n\nTotal:9+30+9=48.\n\nBut in the digit place approach, it's 49. So perhaps I missed one.\n\nWait, in 400-488, units digit 4 appears at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times.\n\nFrom 100-399, units digit 4 appears at 104,114,...,394. That's 30 times.\n\nFrom 1-99, units digit 4 appears at 4,14,24,...,94. That's 9 times.\n\nSo total units digit 4's:9+30+9=48.\n\nBut in the digit place approach, it's 49. So where's that extra 1?\n\nWait, perhaps in the digit place approach, I included 484 as part of 400-488, but maybe I should check if 484 is included.\n\nYes, 484 is within 400-488, so that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but perhaps the digit place approach counts 488 as well, but 488 doesn't have a 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, no, 488 has 8 in units place.\n\nWait, maybe the digit place approach is correct, and I missed a 4 in the first approach.\n\nWait, perhaps in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place:440-449 is 10 4's.\n\nUnits place:9 4's.\n\nTotal:89+10+9=108.\n\nSo from 400-488, 108 4's.\n\nFrom 100-399:60.\n\nFrom 1-99:19.\n\nTotal:108+60=168+19=187.\n\nBut in the digit place approach, units place is 49, which is 48 from the first approach plus 1 more. Wait, where is that extra 1?\n\nWait, perhaps in the digit place approach, I counted 488 as having 8 in units place, but 488 is included in the units place count, but it doesn't add a 4.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the digit place approach.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the units place 4's using the digit place approach.\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nNumber of complete decades:48 (48\u00d710=480).\n\nIn each complete decade, units digit 4 appears once, so 48 times.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 numbers:481-488.\n\nIn these, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484.\n\nSo total units digit 4's:48+1=49.\n\nAh, so that's correct. So in the first approach, I had 48 units digit 4's, but actually, it's 49. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the first approach, from 400-488, I counted 9 units digit 4's, which is correct (404,414,...,484). From 100-399, 30 units digit 4's. From 1-99,9 units digit 4's. So total units digit 4's:9+30+9=48. But according to the"

    "text": " Let me think about the digits in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nI think I should analyze each digit place separately because the occurrence of 4's and 8's can be counted in each place individually. So, I'll consider the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, in the units place, each digit, including 4 and 8, appears equally often. But wait, the total number of pages is 488, which is not a multiple of 10. So, I need to adjust for that. Let me calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages. \n\nDividing 488 by 10 gives me 48 complete groups, which account for 480 pages. Then, there are 8 remaining pages (481 to 488). In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, in 48 groups, each digit appears 48 times in the units place. Now, looking at the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (484), and the digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and the digit 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and similarly for 8 (80-89). So, in each block of 100, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. \n\nNow, let's see how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages. Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, we have four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these hundreds contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, for each hundred, that's 10 each, and four hundreds would be 40 each. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. Each hundred block (like 1-100) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for four hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences for each digit in the tens place. \n\nBut wait, 488 is 488 pages, so after 400, we have 88 more pages: 401-488. So, in the tens place for these 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, let's look at how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this last partial hundred. \n\nFrom 401-410, the tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8. From 411-420, tens digit is 1, again no. Similarly, 421-430: tens digit 2; 431-440: tens digit 3; 441-450: tens digit 4. So, in 441-450, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 times. Then, 451-460: tens digit 5; 461-470: 6; 471-480: 7; and 481-488: tens digit 8, which is 8 times (since 481-488 is 8 numbers). \n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). Therefore, in the tens place overall, the digit 4 appears 40 (from the four complete hundreds) + 10 = 50 times, and the digit 8 appears 40 + 8 = 48 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. That means there are 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, right? So, let me correct that. Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since they are two-digit numbers), but actually, in page numbers, the first page is 1, which is a single digit, so perhaps I should consider that differently. Wait, but for the hundreds place, only pages 100 and above have a hundreds digit. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so the hundreds digit is 0 for them, but since we're only considering digits printed, maybe we can ignore the hundreds place for pages 1-99 because they don't have a hundreds digit. \n\nWait, actually, page numbers from 1-99 are printed as one or two digits, so the hundreds digit isn't present. So, the hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, let's think about how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom page 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4 or 8.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, how many pages have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, does the digit 8 ever appear in the hundreds place? Let's see, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. There's no page where the hundreds digit is 8, because 800 would be way beyond 488. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nTens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nWait, that seems off because 49 + 48 is 97, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the units place, both have 49.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 has 50, 8 has 48.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 has 89, 8 has 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. Let me re-examine that.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nNow, in the tens place, from 401-488, I had:\n\n- 441-450: 10 times 4 in the tens place.\n\n- 481-488: 8 times 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 441-450, which is correct, and 8 appears 8 times in 481-488. So, adding that to the four complete hundreds, which each had 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place, that's 4*10=40 for each, so 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+8=48 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, 488 pages: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 in the units place, so 48 each, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48+1=49 for both digits. That's correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Because the hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards, but in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. That's correct.\n\nBut wait, when I count the hundreds place, each page from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 pages, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, in the last partial hundred (401-488), I correctly accounted for 10 times 4 and 8 times 8.\n\nSo, the total for 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nFor 8's, it's 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nThus, 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I feel like 91 might be too high. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference.\n\nCalculating total 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 50.\n\nHundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 48.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the last partial hundred. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times.\n\n8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 8 times in that last partial hundred.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, total 4's: 4*10 (from each complete hundred) +10 =50.\n\nTotal 8's: 4*10 +8=48.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each.\n\nThen, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So, total units: 48+1=49 for both.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference is indeed 91.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because 91 seems a large number, but considering that the hundreds place contributes 89 4's, which is a lot, maybe it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97, so 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that seems to be the case.\n\nSo, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. Therefore, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Let me consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). Now, how many full sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, and the digit 8 appears 48 times. But wait, in the last 8 pages, which are 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, the digit 8 appears one more time in page 488. So, units place: 4 appears 48 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit changes every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages. So, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). In each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 times 10 is 40. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 440-449, that's 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, 10 times. For 8, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 480 is the start and 488 is the end). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place only in pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nLet me sum up the counts:\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 48, 8 appears 49\n- Tens place: 4 appears 50, 8 appears 49\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89, 8 appears 0\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor units place, 488 pages: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once more. So, 48 + 0 = 48 for 4, 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. That's correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40 for 4 and 40 for 8. Then, in the last 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0-8. So, for 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 times. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 40 +10=50 for 4, 40 +9=49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 48 +50 +89= 187\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\nDifference:187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the hundreds place for 4 is 89 times, but the hundreds place is only for 400-488, which is 89 pages, each having a 4 in the hundreds digit. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. Each full ten contributes one 4 and one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full tens, with 8 remaining pages. So, units place: 48 times 4 and 48 times 8, then in the last 8 pages, units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more. So, 48 +0=48 for 4, 48 +1=49 for 8. That's correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 times, and for 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 40 +10=50 for 4, 40 +9=49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times 4. 8 never appears in hundreds place. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up: 4's:48+50+89=187, 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised that the difference is 89. Let me see if I missed anything.\n\nWait, when I calculated the hundreds place, I considered 400-488 as 89 pages. Let me confirm: 488 - 400 +1 =89. Yes, correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in each digit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488/10) =48, plus if the last digit is >=4, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1 if 4 <= units digit. Wait, no, that's for the last partial set. Wait, actually, the formula is:\n\nFor units digit, number of times digit d appears is floor(n/10)*1 + (1 if d <= (n mod 10) else 0). Wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Wait, for each digit, the count is:\n\nFor units digit, count = (n + 1) // 10 * 1 + min( (n + 1) % 10, d ) if d > 0 else 0.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nWait, for units digit, in 488 numbers, how many times does 4 appear? It's the number of complete decades (48) times 1, plus if the last partial decade (8 numbers) includes 4, which it does (484 is the last 4 in units place before 488). Wait, no, 484 is page 484, which is within 481-488. So, units digit 4 appears once more. So, total units digit 4's: 48 +1=49? Wait, that contradicts my earlier count.\n\nWait, this is where I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, when I divided 488 by 10, I got 48 full decades (each contributing one 4 in units place) and 8 remaining pages. So, in those 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place in this last partial decade? Yes, at 484. So, that's one more 4. Therefore, units digit 4's: 48 +1=49. Similarly, units digit 8's: in the last partial decade, 488 has units digit 8, so that's one more 8. So, units digit 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought units digit 4's were 48, but actually it's 49 because 484 is included in the last partial decade. Similarly, units digit 8's are 49 because 488 is included.\n\nWait, that changes things. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, units place:\n\n4's: 48 full decades *1 +1 (from 484) =49\n\n8's:48 full decades *1 +1 (from 488) =49\n\nSo, units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 48 and 8's were 49, but that was a mistake. The correct count is 49 for both.\n\nLet me adjust the counts.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8, so 40 each.\n\nThen, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nFor 4's in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n4's:40 +10=50\n\n8's:40 +9=49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) =49+50+89=188\n\n8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90\n\nWait, now I'm getting a difference of 90, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me recalculate units place correctly.\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place:\n\nNumber of complete decades: floor(488/10)=48. Each contributes one 4, so 48.\n\nIn the last partial decade (pages 481-488), units digits are 1-8. So, does 4 appear? Yes, at 484. So, +1. So total units 4's:48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, units 8's: same logic, 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Last partial decade: 488 has units digit 8, so +1. So, units 8's:48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each.\n\nIn the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nFor 4's in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 pages, so +10.\n\nFor 8's in tens place:480-488, which is 9 pages, so +9.\n\nSo, tens place:\n\n4's:40+10=50\n\n8's:40+9=49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:400-488, which is 89 pages, so +89.\n\n8's:0.\n\nSo, total:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89 because I miscalculated the units place. So, the correct answer should be 90.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n488 /10=48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each.\n\nIn the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488). So, units 4's:48+1=49, units 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, 40 each.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digits go from 0-8.\n\nFor 4's in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 pages, so +10.\n\nFor 8's in tens place:480-488, which is 9 pages, so +9.\n\nSo, tens 4's:40+10=50, tens 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:400-488, 89 pages, so +89.\n\n8's:0.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct now. So, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) include 484 (one more 4) and 488 (one more 8).\n   - **Total:** 4's = 48 + 1 = 49; 8's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place.\n   - 4 hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - In 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 more 4's, and 480-488 adds 9 more 8's.\n   - **Total:** 4's = 40 + 10 = 50; 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488 contributes 89 4's.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total:** 4's = 89; 8's = 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me list out the page numbers and think about how the digits are arranged.\n\nMaybe I should consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can calculate how many times each digit appears in each position and then sum them up. So, I'll start by looking at the units place. For the units digit, every digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten pages. For example, pages 1-10 have each digit once in the units place, 11-20 have each digit once, and so on.\n\nSo, for the units place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in every block of ten pages, 4 appears once in the units place. So, I can calculate how many complete blocks of ten there are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 more pages. In each complete block, 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (pages 481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once here as well. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, in each complete block of ten, 8 appears once. So, 48 times. Then, in the last partial block, 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but that's the same number of 4's and 8's in the units place. Hmm, maybe I need to check that again. Let me think: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 pages. So, 48 times 1 for each digit in units place, and then 8 pages where digits 1-8 appear once each. So, yes, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place in the partial block, so total 49 each. So, units place doesn't contribute to the difference.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears ten times in a block of 100 pages. For example, in pages 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 80-89, which is 10 times.\n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and then 88 pages. In each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for 4, that's 4*10 = 40 times. For 8, it's also 4*10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred (pages 401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the tens place, each digit appears for 10 pages, except possibly the last one if the total number doesn't reach the next hundred. So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, how many times does it appear? For tens digit 0: pages 401-410 (10 pages), 1: 411-420 (10), 2: 421-430 (10), 3: 431-440 (10), 4: 441-450 (10), 5: 451-460 (10), 6: 461-470 (10), 7: 471-480 (10), 8: 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 481-490 would be 10 pages, but since we only have up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me clarify. In the range 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but only up to 488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? From 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 times. 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 times. Similarly up to 471-480: tens digit 7, 10 times. Then, 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 times because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in the 440-449 range, which is 10 times. 8 appears in 480-488, which is 8 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 480 is the first page, then 481, 482, up to 488, which is 9 pages. Wait, no, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488 is 9 pages (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me recount.\n\nIn the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, except the last one, which is 8, appearing 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). Therefore, total in the tens place: 4's = 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50, and 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in the tens place were 40 from the complete hundreds, and then 10 more in the partial, making 50. For 8's, it's 40 from the complete hundreds, plus 9 in the partial, making 49. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times. So, that's a difference of 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from page 1 to 99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's zero. From 100 onwards, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book goes up to 488.\n\nSo, let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, each page number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. There are no pages numbered 800-899, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. That's a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit position.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me go back. In the units place, I had 49 4's and 49 8's. In the tens place, I had 50 4's and 49 8's. In the hundreds place, 89 4's and 0 8's. So, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, that seems high. Let me check each step again.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages, 4 appears once in units. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once. So, 48 +1=49 for 4's. Similarly for 8's: 48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10=40 for 4's, 40 for 8's. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), which is 88 pages. Let's see, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but only up to 488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410: 10 pages\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420: 10\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430: 10\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440: 10\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450: 10\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460: 10\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470: 10\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480: 10\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488: 8 pages\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4 appears in the 441-450 range, which is 10 times. 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, in the partial hundred, 4's in tens place: 10, 8's: 8. So, total in tens place: 4's = 40 +10=50, 8's=40 +8=48.\n\nWait, earlier I thought 8's in tens place were 49, but now I'm getting 48. Hmm, where did I go wrong? Let me recount.\n\nWait, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go up to 8, but only up to 488. So, for tens digit 8, it's from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, 480 is included, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred. So, 4's in tens place: 10, 8's:9.\n\nTherefore, total in tens place: 4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+9=49. So, 4's have 50, 8's have 49. So, that's correct. So, 4's in tens place:50, 8's:49.\n\nThen, hundreds place: 4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8's never appear in hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me check if I counted correctly in each place.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, last 8 pages, 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once. So, 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 for 4's and 10 for 8's. So, 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), 4's in tens place: 10 (441-450), 8's:9 (480-488). So, 50 for 4's, 49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's from 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 times. 8's:0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488 -400 +1=89.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, 488-400=88, plus 1=89. Correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: each hundred contributes 100 pages. So, 400-499 would be 100 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the partial hundred. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, except the last one, which is 8, appearing 9 times because we stop at 488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, yes, 10 and 9 respectively.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's in tens place:50, 8's:49.\n\nTherefore, the total difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total units place occurrences:\n     - '4's: 48 full tens (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the last 8 pages = 49.\n     - '8's: Similarly, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in every 100 pages.\n   - Total tens place occurrences:\n     - '4's: 4 full hundreds (4 \u00d7 10) + 10 in the partial hundred (440-449) = 50.\n     - '8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 in the partial hundred (480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - '4's appear from page 400 to 488, which is 89 times.\n   - '8's do not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nSumming these:\n- Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by thinking about how many times each digit from 0 to 9 appears in each place. For the units place, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Then this pattern repeats every 10 numbers. \n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), and so on up to 9 (90-99). Each of these digits appears 10 times in the tens place. \n\nThe hundreds place is a bit different because the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit can only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, actually, since the first page is 1, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So the hundreds digit doesn't go beyond 4 in this case. \n\nNow, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, as I thought earlier, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and an extra 8 numbers. So, in each complete group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. Therefore, in 48 complete groups, there are 48 fours and 48 eights in the units place. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. Hmm, interesting, so in the units place, they're equal so far.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? That's 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49), so that's 10 fours. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89), so 10 eights per hundred. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 fours and 4*10 = 40 eights in the tens place from the complete hundreds.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Let's break this down. The tens digit in 401-409 is 0, 410-419 is 1, 420-429 is 2, 430-439 is 3, 440-449 is 4, 450-459 is 5, 460-469 is 6, 470-479 is 7, 480-488 is 8. So, in the tens place, we have:\n\n- 401-409: tens digit 0 (9 numbers, since 409 is the last one before 410)\n- 410-419: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 420-429: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 430-439: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 440-449: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 450-459: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 460-469: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 470-479: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 480-488: tens digit 8 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and the digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. Therefore, in the tens place, we have 10 fours and 9 eights. \n\nAdding this to the previous 40 fours and 40 eights from the complete hundreds, the total for tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours and 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449), so that's correct. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 9 eights. So, yes, 10 fours and 9 eights in the tens place for the last partial hundred. Therefore, total tens place: 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit only goes up to 4 in this book, so the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit:\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the total eights from total fours: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 488 pages, so units digit cycles every 10. 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So 48 each, then the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488). So total units: 49 fours, 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 40 fours and 40 eights.\n- From 401-488, the tens digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. The digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times), and 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times). So 10 fours and 9 eights.\n- Total tens: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place. So, 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nTotal fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), we find that the digit 4 appears 188 times and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Subtracting these gives a difference of 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, no, page 1 is the first page, so actually, the last page is 488, right? So, the page numbers range from 1 to 488. Let me confirm that: yes, 488 pages mean the last page is 488.\n\nNow, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Because the number of times a digit appears in each position can be calculated independently.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. But since we're starting from 1, the first block is 1-10, where 0 doesn't appear in the units place until page 10. Wait, actually, page 1 is 1, so the units digits go from 1 to 0 in the first 10 pages. Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of full decades (sets of 10 numbers) and then handle any remaining pages.\n\nLet me think: For the units place, the number of times a digit appears is equal to the number of complete decades (sets of 10) multiplied by 1 (since each digit appears once per decade) plus the number of times the digit appears in the remaining pages beyond the last complete decade.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in the units place across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nSo, for the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete sets of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. However, we need to check if the 48th set ends at 480, and then from 481 to 488, there's an additional 488, which is 488, so the units digit is 8, so no additional 4 in the units place beyond 480. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: same logic. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, in the 48th set, which is 480-489, but our book only goes up to 488, so in the units place, 8 appears once in each set, so 48 times. But wait, let's check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times, so 48 8's. So, units place: 4 appears 48 times, 8 appears 48 times. So, the difference in the units place is 0.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digits cycle every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's calculate how many complete hundreds are in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. Each complete hundred contributes 10 times the digit in the tens place. So, for 4, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. But wait, we also have the partial hundred from 400 to 488. In the tens place, from 400 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, 2 for 420-429, 3 for 430-439, 4 for 440-449, 5 for 450-459, 6 for 460-469, 7 for 470-479, and 8 for 480-488. Wait, but we're only interested in the digit 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me correct that. For the tens place, in the range 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 10 times in the partial hundred, and digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total number of times 4 appears in the tens place: 4 complete hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the partial hundred, so 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: 4 complete hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the partial hundred, so 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would be 4 * 10 = 40 times for each digit. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For the digit 8 in the tens place, it's from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total for 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal for 8 in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 numbers. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (but since we're starting at 1, maybe we can ignore that as leading zeros aren't printed). From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? Each 10 numbers contribute one 4. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, from 1-480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 4's. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so no additional 4's. So, units place: 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic, 48 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 each.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nFor 4 in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's.\n\nFor 8 in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\n8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place? From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488). So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more 4's in the tens place beyond the 400.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more 8's beyond the 400.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about the hundreds place: from 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so 4's in hundreds place only start at 400. So, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in hundreds place.\n\nAnd 8's in hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are none. So, 0 8's in hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, the hundreds place contributes 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nAdding up all the differences:\n\nUnits place: 48 vs 48 \u2192 0 difference.\n\nTens place: 50 vs 49 \u2192 1 difference.\n\nHundreds place: 89 vs 0 \u2192 89 difference.\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets (480 pages) with 8 remaining pages.\n   - **4's:** 48 times.\n   - **8's:** 48 times.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - From 1-400: 4 sets of 100, contributing 40 each.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - **4's:** 440-449 (10 times).\n     - **8's:** 480-488 (9 times).\n   - **4's:** 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **8's:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference: 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488: 89 numbers with hundreds digit 4.\n   - **4's:** 89.\n   - **8's:** 0.\n   - Difference: 89.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n- **8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how many digits each page number has. Pages 1 through 9 are single-digit, so that's 9 pages. Pages 10 through 99 are two-digit, which is 90 pages. Pages 100 through 488 are three-digit, so that's 488 - 99 = 389 pages. Wait, no, 488 - 99 is 389, but actually, from 100 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 pages. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position compared to the digit 8.\n\nI think the best approach is to analyze each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each position, I'll calculate how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears, then find the difference.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, in every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 more numbers. In each block, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 * 1 + 1 (since the last block has 8 numbers, and 4 is in the units place once more). Wait, no, actually, the last 8 numbers would be from 481 to 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once in the last 8 numbers, so total 4's in units place would be 48 * 1 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's in the units place would be 48 * 1 + 1 = 49 as well, because in the last 8 numbers, 8 is the units digit once. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8, so yes, 8 appears once in the last block. So, units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49, so difference is 0.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for example, in 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 0-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds do we have? From 1 to 488, we have four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, from 1-99 is the first hundred, then 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's five hundreds? Wait, no, 1-99 is 99 numbers, not a hundred. So, maybe I should think differently. Let's consider each hundred as 100 numbers. So, 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, that's five blocks, but the last block is only 88 numbers (from 401 to 488). So, for the tens place, in each complete hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4 * 10 = 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's in the tens place. Now, what about the last block, 401-488? Let's see, the tens digit here cycles from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; ... up to 481-488, tens digit is 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Well, the tens digit is 4 when the page numbers are 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the last block. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place when the page numbers are 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last block. Therefore, total in the tens place: 4's = 40 (from first four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. 8's = 40 (from first four hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, difference in tens place is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place? For 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, so 1 appears 100 times. Similarly, 2 appears 100 times in 200-299, 3 appears 100 times in 300-399, and 4 appears 89 times in 400-488 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, we're looking for how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place. So, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears... well, does 8 ever appear in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, 4's in hundreds place: 89, 8's in hundreds place: 0. So, difference is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 0\n- Tens place: +1\n- Hundreds place: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with units place: I had 488 pages. For units digit, each digit 0-9 appears equally in each block of 10. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 in units place. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, total 4's in units place: 48*1 +1=49, same for 8's: 49. So, difference 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) each contribute 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 times. 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page). So, 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's:40+9=49. Difference +1. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488), and 8 never appears. So, difference +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 +1 +89=90. So, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is 4 appearing 89 times in the hundreds place correct? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So yes, that's 89 times.\n\nAnd in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times, so +1.\n\nUnits place, both 49 times, so 0.\n\nSo total difference is 89 +1=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for the last block. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, how many times does it appear? For example, tens digit 0: 401-410, which is 10 numbers. Tens digit 1: 411-420, 10 numbers, and so on up to tens digit 8: 481-488, which is 8 numbers, but wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so 8 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 9 numbers because 488 -480 +1=9. Wait, 480 is included, so from 480-488 is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 is page 480, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last block. So, total 4's in tens place: 10, 8's:9, so 4's in tens place: 40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49. So, difference +1. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last block. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears equally in each block of 10.\n   - Total blocks of 10: 48 complete blocks (480 pages) + 8 extra pages.\n   - 4's: 48 occurrences + 1 (from 481-488) = 49.\n   - 8's: 48 occurrences + 1 (from 481-488) = 49.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred.\n   - Complete hundreds: 400 pages, contributing 40 each for 4 and 8.\n   - Last 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 4's: 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8's: 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference: +1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears.\n   - Difference: +89.\n\n**Total Difference**: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me list out the page numbers as one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers separately.\n\nOne-digit page numbers are from 1 to 9. Two-digit numbers are from 10 to 99. Three-digit numbers are from 100 to 488. So, I should analyze each of these groups separately to count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me start with one-digit numbers. These are 1 through 9. The digits here are just single digits, so I can check if 4 and 8 appear in this range. Well, 4 is in this range, as is 8. So, each appears once. So, in one-digit numbers, we have one 4 and one 8. So, the count for 4's is 1, and for 8's, it's also 1.\n\nNext, let's move on to two-digit numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should consider each digit place separately when counting the 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9. So, for each tens digit, the units digit can be from 0 to 9. So, for the tens place, each digit from 1 to 9 appears exactly 10 times (since each tens digit is paired with 0 through 9). Similarly, for the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 9 times (since there are 9 possible tens digits for each units digit).\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me correct that. For two-digit numbers, the tens place can be 1 through 9, and each tens digit appears 10 times (for each units digit 0-9). So, for the tens place, each digit from 1 to 9 appears 10 times. For the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 9 times (since there are 9 different tens digits). So, for the units place, digits 0-9 each appear 9 times.\n\nSo, in the two-digit numbers, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nStarting with the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, which is another 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nNow, for the units place: The digit 4 appears in the units place for numbers 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times, right? Because the tens digit can be from 1 to 9, each paired with a 4 in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the units place for 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's also 9 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, the number 44 has both a 4 in the tens and units place, so we're counting that twice, once in the tens and once in the units. But since we're just counting the total number of 4's, that's fine. Similarly, 88 has two 8's, so it's counted twice in the units place.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. And the total number of 8's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. So, in two-digit numbers, 4's and 8's each appear 19 times. So, the counts so far are:\n\nOne-digit numbers: 4's = 1, 8's = 1.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 4's = 19, 8's = 19.\n\nSo, total up to two-digit numbers: 4's = 20, 8's = 20.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three digit places: hundreds, tens, and units. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's note that the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book goes up to 488. So, hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but for 4, it only goes up to 488, not 499. So, I need to be careful with the hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, let's consider the hundreds place first.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1, 2, 3: Each of these will have numbers from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 respectively. Each of these ranges has 100 numbers, so each hundreds digit 1, 2, 3 appears 100 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: The numbers go from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 4's and 8's in the hundreds, tens, and units places for three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- Digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place for any three-digit number in this book because the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place for three-digit numbers.\n\nFor each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3, 4), the tens digit can be 0-9, and for each tens digit, the units digit can be 0-9. However, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit only goes up to 8 because the last page is 488. Wait, no. Wait, 400-488: the tens digit can be 0-8, because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 400-488 includes all numbers where the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit can be 0-8, but for tens digit 8, the units digit can only go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, the tens digit can be 0-9, each for 10 numbers. But for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0-8, and for tens digit 8, the units digit can only go up to 8.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each of these has 100 numbers, so for each, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundreds digit, each tens digit from 0-9 appears 10 times. So, for each of these hundreds digits, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 4: The tens digit can be 0-8. For tens digits 0-7, each appears 10 times (since units digits go from 0-9). But for tens digit 8, it only goes up to 488, so units digits go from 0-8, which is 9 times. So, for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Tens digit 0-7: each appears 10 times.\n- Tens digit 8: appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each contributes 10 times for tens digits 4 and 8.\n- For hundreds digit 4: Tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: 3 hundreds digits * 10 times each = 30.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 10 times.\n- Total: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nSimilarly, total 8's in the tens place:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: 3 * 10 = 30.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 9 times.\n- Total: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place for three-digit numbers.\n\nAgain, for hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has 100 numbers, so for each, the units digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundreds digit, the units digit 4 appears 10 times, and the units digit 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: The numbers go from 400-488. Let's consider the units digits. For each tens digit from 0-8, the units digit can be 0-9 except when the tens digit is 8, where units digit can only go up to 8. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0-8. For each tens digit, the units digit can be 0-9 except when the tens digit is 8, where units digit can only be 0-8 because the last number is 488.\n\nSo, for units digit 4 in hundreds digit 4:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each has units digit 4 once, so that's 8 times.\n- For tens digit 8: Units digit 4 is present in 484, so that's 1 time.\n- So, total units digit 4 in hundreds digit 4: 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8 in hundreds digit 4:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each has units digit 8 once, so that's 8 times.\n- For tens digit 8: Units digit 8 is present in 488, so that's 1 time.\n- So, total units digit 8 in hundreds digit 4: 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For hundreds digit 4, the numbers are 400 to 488. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 units digits (0-9), so units digit 4 appears once per tens digit, so 8 times (tens 0-7) plus 1 time in tens 8 (484), so total 9 times.\n- Similarly, units digit 8 appears once per tens digit 0-7 (so 8 times) and once in tens 8 (488), so total 9 times.\n\nSo, for units digit 4 in hundreds digit 4: 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 in hundreds digit 4: 9 times.\n\nSo, total units digit 4 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each contributes 10 times, so 3 * 10 = 30.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 9 times.\n- Total: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: 3 * 10 = 30.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 9 times.\n- Total: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because in hundreds digit 4, units digit 8 appears 9 times, but for hundreds digits 1,2,3, units digit 8 appears 10 times each, so 3*10=30, plus 9 gives 39.\n\nWait, but let me check the units digit 4 and 8 in hundreds digit 4 again.\n\nWait, in hundreds digit 4, the units digit 4 appears in numbers like 404, 414, ..., 484. So, for tens digits 0-8, each has one 4 in the units place. So, that's 9 times (tens digits 0-8). Similarly, units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, ..., 488, which is also 9 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nIn three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89 times.\n  - 8's: 0 times.\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 40 times.\n  - 8's: 39 times.\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 39 times.\n  - 8's: 39 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nWait, let me verify that calculation again.\n\nWait, 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up all the counts from one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nFirst, one-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed more than 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nLet me go through each section again.\n\nOne-digit numbers: 1-9.\n\n4 appears once (page 4), 8 appears once (page 8). Correct.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nUnits place: For each tens digit, 4 appears once, so 9 times (14,24,...,94). Similarly, 8 appears 9 times (18,28,...,98). So, total 4's: 10 + 9 = 19, 8's: 10 + 9 = 19. Correct.\n\nThree-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 3*10=30 for each.\n- For hundreds digit 4: Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), but wait, no, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but in our case, hundreds digit 4 goes up to 488, so the tens digit 4 in hundreds digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, tens digit 8 in hundreds digit 4 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 times.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that for hundreds digit 4, tens digit 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times, which seems correct.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 3*10 (from 1,2,3) + 10 (from 4) = 40.\n\nTens place 8's: 3*10 (from 1,2,3) + 9 (from 4) = 39.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the units place, so 3*10=30 for each.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Units digit 4: appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times.\n- Units digit 8: appears in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times.\n\nSo, units place 4's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place 8's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nAdding up all sections:\n\n4's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\n8's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I added up the 4's and 8's in the three-digit numbers, I got 168 and 78 respectively, but let me make sure that's accurate.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: for three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit 4 contributes 89 numbers, but in those, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nIn the hundreds place, it's 89 4's.\n\nIn the tens place, for hundreds digit 4, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nIn the units place, for hundreds digit 4, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's from hundreds digit 4: 89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 108.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168. Wait, that can't be right because 40 and 39 include contributions from hundreds digits 1,2,3 as well. So, perhaps I was correct earlier.\n\nWait, no, I think I confused something. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen I calculated the tens place for three-digit numbers, I considered all hundreds digits 1,2,3,4. Similarly, for the units place.\n\nSo, the 40 in tens place includes 3*10 (from 1,2,3) + 10 (from 4) for 4's, and 3*10 + 9 for 8's.\n\nSimilarly, the units place 39 for 4's includes 3*10 (from 1,2,3) + 9 (from 4).\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\n8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm going to check another approach to make sure.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position across all page numbers.\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nPage numbers: 1 to 488.\n\nWe can consider each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears approximately the same number of times.\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete cycles of 10 in 488: 48 full cycles (480 numbers) plus 8 extra numbers.\n\nIn each full cycle of 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place.\n\nSo, for units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: 48 times (from 48 full cycles) plus 1 more if the remaining 8 numbers include a 4. The remaining numbers are 481-488, so units digits are 1-8. So, 4 is present once more. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 times from full cycles plus 1 more in the remaining (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 is present once. So, yes, 49 each.\n\nWait, but earlier when I broke it down, I had 39 in three-digit numbers, but perhaps this approach is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check.\n\nWait, using this method, total 4's in units place: 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers.\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n\nWait, actually, 488 is 4*100 + 88, so it's 4 complete hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n\nWait, no, 400-488 is not a complete hundred; it's 89 numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each complete hundred. There are 4 complete hundreds: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens digit cycles through 0-8, each appearing 9 times (since 89 / 10 = 8 full cycles plus 9 extra). Wait, no, that's not accurate.\n\nWait, for the tens digit in 400-488:\n\n- Tens digits go from 0-8.\n\nFor each tens digit from 0-7, there are 10 numbers (units 0-9).\n\nFor tens digit 8, there are 9 numbers (units 0-8).\n\nSo, in 400-488:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times.\n- Tens digit 8: appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- In 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 occurrences of each digit 0-9 in the tens place, so 10 times each per hundred. So, 3 hundreds * 10 = 30 times each for digits 0-9.\n\n- In 400-488: tens digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place counts:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 30 (from 1-3 hundreds) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40 times each.\n- For digit 8: 30 (from 1-3 hundreds) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times.\n- For digits 9: 30 times only (from 1-3 hundreds).\n\nSo, for 4's in tens place: 40 times.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 39 times.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place:\n\n- In 100-199: hundreds digit 1 appears 100 times.\n- In 200-299: hundreds digit 2 appears 100 times.\n- In 300-399: hundreds digit 3 appears 100 times.\n- In 400-488: hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place counts:\n\n- 4's: 89 times.\n- 8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 40\n- 8's: 39\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nAdding them up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88.\n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier total of 188 for 4's and 98 for 8's. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the first approach, I considered one-digit numbers separately, but in the second approach, I considered all numbers up to 488, including one-digit and two-digit. So, perhaps I need to reconcile these.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I broke down one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers, but in the second approach, I considered all numbers as three-digit with leading zeros, which might not be accurate because pages 1-9 are one-digit, not three-digit.\n\nWait, perhaps the second approach is incorrect because it's considering all numbers as three-digit, which they're not. So, I should stick to the first approach.\n\nWait, but let me see: in the first approach, I had 188 4's and 98 8's, but in the second approach, I have 178 4's and 88 8's. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps the second approach is wrong because it's including leading zeros, which aren't actually present. For example, page 1 is just '1', not '001', so the tens and hundreds digits aren't actually printed. So, the second approach is incorrect because it's assuming all page numbers are three-digit, which they're not. Therefore, the first approach is the correct one.\n\nSo, going back to the first approach:\n\nTotal 4's: 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place in the first approach.\n\nIn the first approach, for three-digit numbers, units digit 4 appears 39 times and units digit 8 appears 39 times. Then, adding one-digit and two-digit numbers:\n\nOne-digit: units digit 4 once, 8 once.\n\nTwo-digit: units digit 4 nine times, 8 nine times.\n\nThree-digit: units digit 4 thirty-nine times, 8 thirty-nine times.\n\nSo, total units digit 4: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49.\n\nUnits digit 8: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49.\n\nWhich matches the second approach. So, units digits are correct.\n\nSimilarly, tens digits:\n\nOne-digit numbers don't have a tens digit, so only two-digit and three-digit numbers contribute.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: tens digit 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nThree-digit numbers: tens digit 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 10 + 40 = 50.\n\nTens digit 8's: 10 + 39 = 49.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I had:\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 4's in tens place:10, 8's in tens place:10.\n\nThree-digit numbers: 4's in tens place:40, 8's in tens place:39.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:10 + 40=50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place:10 + 39=49.\n\nBut in the first approach, I had:\n\n4's in two-digit:19, which is 10 (tens) +9 (units).\n\nSimilarly, 8's in two-digit:19=10+9.\n\nSo, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach by adding the tens and units separately but not accounting for the fact that the tens digit in two-digit numbers is only for two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently: count each digit place across all numbers, considering that one-digit numbers don't have tens or hundreds digits.\n\nSo, let me try this:\n\n- Units place: as calculated, 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n- Tens place: For two-digit numbers, 10-99, each tens digit 0-9 appears 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFor three-digit numbers, 100-488, as calculated, tens digit 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:10 (two-digit) +40 (three-digit)=50.\n\nTotal tens place 8's:10 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit)=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: only three-digit numbers contribute. 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49 +49=98.\n\nYes, that matches the first approach. So, the first approach was correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the second approach, I had 178 4's and 88 8's, but that was incorrect because it included leading zeros, which aren't present. So, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure once more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small table to count the occurrences.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to stick with the first approach, as it's more detailed and accounts for each digit place correctly.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Categorize Page Numbers:**\n   - **One-digit pages (1-9):** Each digit appears once.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):** Each digit appears in tens and units places.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):** Each digit appears in hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\n2. **Count 4's and 8's in One-Digit Pages:**\n   - **4's:** 1 (page 4)\n   - **8's:** 1 (page 8)\n\n3. **Count 4's and 8's in Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times (40-49)\n     - 8 appears 10 times (80-89)\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94)\n     - 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98)\n   - **Total in Two-Digit Pages:**\n     - 4's: 10 + 9 = 19\n     - 8's: 10 + 9 = 19\n\n4. **Count 4's and 8's in Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n     - 8 appears 0 times\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Hundreds digits 1, 2, 3 each contribute 10 times for 4 and 8\n     - Hundreds digit 4 contributes 10 times for 4 and 9 times for 8\n     - **4's:** 3\u00d710 + 10 = 40\n     - **8's:** 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Hundreds digits 1, 2, 3 each contribute 10 times for 4 and 8\n     - Hundreds digit 4 contributes 9 times for both 4 and 8\n     - **4's:** 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39\n     - **8's:** 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39\n\n5. **Summarize Counts:**\n   - **4's:**\n     - One-digit: 1\n     - Two-digit: 19\n     - Three-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n     - **Total:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n   - **8's:**\n     - One-digit: 1\n     - Two-digit: 19\n     - Three-digit: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n     - **Total:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\n6. **Calculate Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{"

    "text": " Let me think about how many digits each page number has:\n\n- Pages 1-9: These are single-digit page numbers, so each has only one digit.\n- Pages 10-99: These are two-digit numbers, each with tens and units places.\n- Pages 100-488: These are three-digit numbers, each with hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nI think I should handle each of these ranges separately because the number of digits changes, and the way digits appear might differ. Let me start by calculating how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place (1-488):**\n   - For every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n   - Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and an extra 8 pages. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times from the full blocks. Now, in the last partial block (pages 481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8. Since 4 is within this range (484), it appears once more. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (1-488):**\n   - For the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n   - From 40-49: 10 times.\n   - From 140-149: another 10 times.\n   - From 240-249: another 10 times.\n   - From 340-349: another 10 times.\n   - Now, checking if there's a 440-449 block: yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is fully included. So that's another 10 times.\n   - Wait, but 440 is beyond 488? No, 440 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, that's 5 blocks of 10 each, totaling 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (1-488):**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is.\n   - From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, plus one more in the last partial ten (481-488), so 49. Tens: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of 8's in each place:\n\n1. **Units place (1-488):**\n   - Similar to the 4's, for every block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many full blocks of 10 are there in 488?\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 8 appears once here as well (page 488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (1-488):**\n   - For the tens place, the digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488). So, let's count:\n   - 80-89: 10 times.\n   - 180-189: 10 times.\n   - 280-289: 10 times.\n   - 380-389: 10 times.\n   - 480-488: 9 times.\n   - So, total tens place 8's are 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (1-488):**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me verify that. Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, plus one more in the last partial ten (488), so 49. Tens: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9 8's because it goes up to 488. So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds: 0. So, total 8's are 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** For every 10 pages, 4 appears once. There are 48 full decades (1-480) contributing 48 fours. The last 8 pages (481-488) include one more 4 (page 484). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in decades 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each decade contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 pages, contributing 48 eights. The last page (488) adds one more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in decades 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four decades contribute 10 eights each, and the last contributes 9 (pages 480-488). Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider the digits in each place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by thinking about the units place. For every set of ten pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. But wait, that's true until the page numbers reach 488, so I need to make sure I don't go beyond that.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate how many times each digit appears in each position separately. Let's start with the units place. For every ten pages, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, how many sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 more pages. In each of these 48 sets, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, the count is equal in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every hundred. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. Let's see how many hundreds we have. 488 pages mean we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of these 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. That's 4*10 = 40 times each for the first 400 pages.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. The tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 481-488, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages. Wait, but in each of these tens groups, the tens digit is the same for 10 pages. So, in 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; 421-430, 2; 431-440, 3; 441-450, 4; 451-460, 5; 461-470, 6; 471-480, 7; and 481-490, 8. But since we're stopping at 488, the last group (481-488) has 8 pages. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It's only in the group 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the group 481-490, but we only have 8 pages there, so 8 appears 8 times. Wait, but in the tens place, each group is 10 pages, so from 481-490, the tens digit is 8 for all 10 pages, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 8 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, adding that to the previous 40 times each, the total for the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8.\n\nWait, let me check that again. For the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 times. So, yes, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times in the tens place beyond the first 400 pages. So, total for tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8.\n\nNow, let's move to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 from 1-99, 2 from 100-199, 3 from 200-299, 4 from 300-399, and then 4 again from 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles every 100 pages, so after 400, the next would be 500, but our book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's tally up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 to both 4 and 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both, which is correct.\n\nTens place:\n- First 400 pages: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8, so 40 each.\n- Remaining 88 pages (401-488): Tens digits go from 0 to 8. The tens digit 4 appears in 441-450 (10 times), and 8 appears in 481-490, but only up to 488, so 8 times. So, 10 for 4 and 8 for 8, making totals 50 and 48 respectively. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 89 for 4 and 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for 4 is from 400-488, which is 89 pages. Let me confirm that: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about the hundreds place: from 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3. From 400-488, it's 4. So, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91, so there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full sets, contributing 48 each.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 each.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n\\boxed{91}"
