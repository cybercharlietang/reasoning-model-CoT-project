Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll analyze each position for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for the units digit, the number of 4's and 8's can be calculated by seeing how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 and then adding any extra numbers beyond that.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: For every group of 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place (e.g., in 0-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each). So, the number of 4's and 8's in the tens place can be calculated by looking at how many complete hundreds there are and then any remaining tens.\n\nFor the hundreds place: Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, actually, the hundreds digit starts from 0 (for pages 1-99) up to 4 (for pages 400-488). So, I need to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nWait a second, 8 in the hundreds place would only be from pages 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is zero. That might save me some time.\n\nLet me structure this more clearly:\n\n1. **Units Digit:**\n   - For 4's: Each 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. That's 48*1=48. But wait, there are 8 more numbers beyond 480 (481-488). In these, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the next 4 is at 484. So, that's one more 4. So total 48 +1=49.\n   - For 8's: Similarly, each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. 48 full groups give 48 8's. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So, total 48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens Digit:**\n   - For 4's: Each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. Each contributes 10 4's, so 4*10=40. Now, beyond 400, we have 88 more pages (401-488). In the tens place, how many 4's are there? From 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's another 10. So total 40 +10=50.\n   - For 8's: Similarly, each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). 4 complete hundreds give 4*10=40. Now, beyond 400, in 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8 (480-488). So, the 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive, but 488 is a single number, so actually 9 numbers: 480-488, but wait, 480 is the first, so 480,481,...488 is 9 numbers. Wait, no, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). But the tens digit is 8 only for the tens place, so 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place beyond 400. So total 40 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Digit:**\n   - For 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 89 4's.\n   - For 8's: As I thought earlier, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because the book only has 488 pages. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units digit for 4's: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, from 481-488, units digits go 1-8, so 484 is the only one, so 1 more, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits digit for 8's: Similarly, 48 full groups, 48, then 488 adds one more, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens digit for 4's: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. Total 50. Correct.\n\nTens digit for 8's: 4 complete hundreds, 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds digit for 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nHundreds digit for 8's: 0, since the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 4's = 49 +50 +89 = 188. 8's = 49 +49 +0=98. Difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires comparing the number of times the digit '4' appears to the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), we find that '4' appears 188 times and '8' appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Let me start by figuring out how to count the occurrences of each digit.\n\nI remember that when counting digits in numbers, it's helpful to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, I'll consider the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4, I'll first count how many times it appears in the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, 4 appears once (at page 4). From 11 to 20, it appears once at page 14, and so on. \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, let's see how many complete blocks of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and an extra 8 pages. In each complete block, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, for the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), I need to check if 484 is within this range. 484 is page 484, which is within 481-488, so that's one more occurrence. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, I'll count the 4's in the tens place. In the tens place, 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and 240-249, and 340-349. Let me calculate how many such blocks there are up to 488.\n\nEach hundred has one block of 10 where the tens digit is 4, so from 1-400, there are 4 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Each block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449. That's another 10 occurrences. So, adding that to the previous total, 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but I need to check if 440-449 are within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 are included. So, total 4's in the tens place are 50.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Similar to 4, in every block of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, for 488 pages, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and 8 extra pages. So, 48 times in the units place from the complete blocks. Now, checking the remaining 8 pages (481-488), does 488 fall here? Yes, page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, 8's in the tens place. Similar to 4, the tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. From 1-400, there are 4 such blocks, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488. That's 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive), but wait, 480-489 would be a full block, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, checking the hundreds place for 8. The hundreds digit is 8 for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me double-check. So, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last partial block (481-488), 488 has an 8, so 1 more, totaling 49. Tens place: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, so that's 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, 9 more, making it 49. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I counted 4's, I had 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's in the tens place. From 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. Wait, earlier I thought 4 blocks, but actually, from 0-488, the hundreds digit is 4 only starting at 400, so the tens digit being 4 would be in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 50. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 400-488 includes 440-449, which is correct, so 5 blocks. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49, which is correct.\n\nSo, 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 49+50=99+89=188.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the hundreds place, there are none because the book ends at 488, which is less than 800.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the difference was 90, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: every 10 pages, so 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place, so 1 more, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488:89.\n\nTotal 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: same as 4's, 48 full tens, 48, plus 488, so 1 more, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there a possibility I double-counted any digits? For example, in numbers like 44, where both the tens and units digits are 4, does that affect the count? No, because I'm counting each digit separately, so each occurrence is counted once, whether in units, tens, or hundreds.\n\nSimilarly, for 88, each 8 is counted once in units and once in tens.\n\nSo, the counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering the positions where the digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll need to count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each position separately.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, for example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4), and 8 appears once (at 8). \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then an extra 8 pages (481 to 488). So, in each of these 48 sets, both 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. That gives 48 occurrences of 4 and 48 occurrences of 8 in the units place. But wait, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding those, the total for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 for 4 and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. Hmm, so in the units place, both digits appear 49 times. That means the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49), and the same for 8 (like 80-89). \n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of these 4 hundreds, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences for each digit in the tens place from the complete hundreds. Now, looking at the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times, but since we're only going up to 488, the last set is incomplete. Let's see: 401-410, 411-420, ..., 481-488. Wait, actually, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, the tens digit cycles 9 times (0-8), each digit appearing 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and only appears 8 times (from 481-488). \n\nWait, no, actually, from 401-488, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times because 401-410 is 10 numbers, 411-420 is another 10, and so on up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last set (481-488) is only 8 numbers. Hmm, so for the tens digit, in 401-488, the digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. \n\nWait, that might not be right. Let me think again. Each set of 10 in the tens place is 10 numbers. So, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: tens digit is 1, ..., 481-490: tens digit is 8. But since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8, but it only appears 8 times instead of 10. \n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488, the digit 8 appears 8 times, and digits 0-7 each appear 10 times. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (from 440-449), and the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place (from 480-488). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought each complete hundred had 10 occurrences for each digit in the tens place, but now I'm seeing that in the incomplete hundred, 8 only appears 8 times. So, adding up, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) plus 10 (from 440-449 in the 401-488 range) = 50 times. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is another 10 times, so total for 4 in tens place is 40 +10=50. \n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 in the tens place: in each complete hundred, 8 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 range, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times? Or is it 9 times or 8 times? Wait, 480 is page 480, which is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all of these, so that's 9 occurrences. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought 481-488 is 8 pages, but 480 is also part of the 401-488 range, so 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, total for 8 in tens place is 4*10=40 from the complete hundreds plus 9 from the 480-488 range, totaling 49. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought 481-488 is 8 pages, but actually, 480-488 is 9 pages because it includes 480. So, that's 9 occurrences. So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 49 times. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. The range is 401-488. So, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490). But since we stop at 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. Wait, but 480 is part of the previous set, right? 480 would be in the 480-489 range, but since we're only going up to 488, 480 is included in the 401-488 range. Wait, no, 480 is within 401-488, so the tens digit 8 starts at 480, which is included. So, from 480-488, that's 9 pages (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this range. \n\nSo, total for 8 in tens place is 4*10=40 (from 1-400) plus 9 (from 480-488) = 49. \n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the tens place, from 1-400, it's 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's another 10, making total 50. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, the difference in the hundreds place is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences:\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times. Difference: 0.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. Difference: +1.\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. Difference: +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 +1 +89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, and then in the last partial set (481-488), 4 appears once (at 484). So, total 48 +1 =49. Same for 8: 48 full sets, each contributing 1, and in the last partial set, 8 appears once (at 488). So, 49 each. So, units place difference is 0.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 50. For 8 in the tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, total 40+9=49. So, difference is 50-49=1.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place in 1-488. So, difference is 89.\n\nAdding up: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 times. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. 8 doesn't appear there at all.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding.\n\nWait, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\n188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Range:** The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488.\n\n2. **Count Occurrences of Each Digit in Each Place:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - For each set of 10 numbers, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place.\n     - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets (1-480) and a partial set (481-488).\n     - In each full set, 4 and 8 each appear once.

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So I can calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488. \n\n   488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4. That's 48 times. But wait, the last block is from 481 to 490, but our book ends at 488, so the units digit 4 in 484 is still included. So actually, in each block, the 4 appears once, and since 488 is beyond 480, we have 48 complete blocks. So units place gives 48 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 instances where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So how many such blocks are there in 488?\n\n   488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. But wait, the last block is 301-400, and our book goes up to 488, so we also have another partial block from 401-488. In this partial block, the tens digit is 4 in the 400-409 range, which is 10 numbers, but since our book ends at 488, the tens digit 4 appears from 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10 fours. So total tens place fours are 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 401-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 is from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. So total tens place fours are 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. The first four blocks are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these has 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, but since the book starts at 401, that's 10 numbers (401-409). Wait, but 400 is included in the previous block, right? So in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 400-409, but 400 is part of the 301-400 block, so in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 starts at 400, but 400 is already counted. So actually, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 is from 400-409, but 400 is already in the previous block, so in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 401-409, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, because 400 is page 400, which is included in the 301-400 block. So in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 400-409, but 400 is already counted, so the new ones are 401-409, which is 9 numbers. So that's 9 fours. So total tens place fours would be 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Each hundred block (like 1-100) has 10 fours in the tens place (40-49). So for 1-100: 10 fours, 101-200: 10 fours, 201-300: 10 fours, 301-400: 10 fours. That's 4 blocks *10 =40 fours. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, but 400 is already counted in 301-400. So in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 400-409, but 400 is already in the previous block, so the new ones are 401-409, which is 9 numbers, so 9 fours. So total tens place fours: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but 400 is included in 301-400, so in 401-488, the tens digit 4 starts at 400, which is already counted, so in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 400-409, but 400 is already counted, so we have 401-409, which is 9 numbers, so 9 fours. So total tens place fours:40+9=49.\n\nWait, but 400 is page 400, which is included in the 301-400 block, so in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 400-409, but 400 is already counted, so in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 401-409, which is 9 numbers. So total tens place fours:40+9=49.\n\nWait, but 400 is included in the 301-400 block, so in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 400-409, but 400 is already counted, so the new ones are 401-409, which is 9 numbers. So 40 fours from the first four blocks, plus 9 fours from 401-409, totaling 49 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 400 is page 400, which is included in the 301-400 block, so in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 400-409, but 400 is already counted, so in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 401-409, which is 9 numbers. So that's 9 fours. So total tens place fours:40+9=49.\n\nWait, but 400 is page 400, which is included in the 301-400 block, so in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 400-409, but 400 is already counted, so in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 401-409, which is 9 numbers. So that's 9 fours. So total tens place fours:40+9=49.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me calculate how many times the tens digit is 4 from 1 to 488.\n\nThe tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is beyond 488? No, 440-449 is within 488. So let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nThat's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours. So that's correct. So I think my initial approach was wrong because I didn't consider the 440-449 block. So the tens place gives 50 fours.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So total tens place fours:50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 49. I must have made a mistake in the initial approach by not considering the 440-449 block. So the correct count is 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nOkay, moving on.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours.\n\nWait, but 400 is included, so 400 to 488 is 89 numbers. So hundreds place gives 89 fours.\n\nSo total fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) =48+50=98+89=187 fours.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 48+50=98, plus 89 is 187. So total fours printed:187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many blocks of 10 are there? 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8. So that's 48 eights. But wait, the last block is 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so the units digit 8 in 488 is included. So in each block, the 8 appears once, so 48 eights from units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but 480-489 is within 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So let's count:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo total tens place eights:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nSo total eights: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =48+49=97 eights.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place:48, tens place:49, so total eights:97.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:187 -97=90.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units:48\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:48+50=98+89=187.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units:48\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:48+49=97.\n\nDifference:187-97=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. I had 5 blocks of 10 where the tens digit is 4:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each gives 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights in the tens place, the ranges are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers, so 4 full ranges with 10 eights and one with 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits:48 each, which is correct because 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one digit.\n\nHundreds place for fours: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nHundreds place for eights: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo yes, the counts seem correct. So the difference is 187-97=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights there. So yes, 49 in total for tens place.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should analyze the digits in each place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then subtract the two totals to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So in each block of 10, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each full block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So for the units place, 4 appears 48 times and 8 appears 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in these, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, total for units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. So, the units place contributes equally to both digits, so no difference there.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. For example, from 1-10, the tens digit is 0 or 1 (but actually, in page numbers, it's just 1 starting at page 10). Wait, maybe I should think of it as each ten's place cycle being 100 pages. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of each group of 100 pages.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's consider how many times each digit appears in the tens place. For the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nBut since our book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in the first 400 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place (since 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 times each). So, 4 appears 40 times, and 8 appears 40 times in the tens place up to page 400.\n\nNow, looking at pages 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8 again. Wait, no, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (at 401-410) to 8 (at 481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit for 481-488 is 8. So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place from 401 to 488?\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0, so 0 appears 10 times, but we only have 10 pages here, so 0 appears once in the tens place? Wait, no, each page from 401 to 410 has a tens digit of 0, but page 401 is 4 0 1, so the tens digit is 0. So, from 401 to 410, the tens digit is 0 for all 10 pages. Similarly, from 411-420, tens digit is 1, and so on up to 481-490, which would be tens digit 8, but we only go up to 488.\n\nSo, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go through 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each of these digits appears 10 times except for 8, which appears only 8 times because we stop at 488. Wait, no, let me check. From 401-488, the tens digits are as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 pages)\n\nSo, each tens digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times in the tens place from 401-488. Therefore, in the tens place from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. \n\nAdding this to the previous 400 pages, the total for the tens place would be:\n\n- 4: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 times\n- 8: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48 times\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times. That means 4 appears 2 more times than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it only starts appearing from page 100 onwards. Let's see, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so we can ignore that. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 1 appears 100 times (100-199)\n- 2 appears 100 times (200-299)\n- 3 appears 100 times (300-399)\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n\nWait, let me confirm. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 appears 0 times because the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in a 488-page book. The highest hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. Therefore, 4 appears 89 more times than 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit across all places.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\n188 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 91\n\nSo, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of ten, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times 4 appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder. Similarly for 8.\n\nWait, but since 488 isn't a multiple of 10, I need to adjust for the last partial block. Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, for the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, and then in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well.\n\nSo, units place:\n- Number of 4's: 48 (from the complete blocks) + 1 (from the last partial block) = 49\n- Number of 8's: 48 (from the complete blocks) + 1 (from the last partial block) = 49\n\nHmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred block.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n- Number of 4's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40\n- Number of 8's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40\n\nNow, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in this partial block, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Looking at 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, but since 488 is the last page, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 times.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, for each tens digit, the count is 10 except for the last one, which is 88 pages, so 480-488 is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, adding to the previous counts:\n- Tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nWait, that's not correct. Wait, no, because the partial block is 401-488, which is 88 pages. The tens digits in this block are from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which appears 9 times. So, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs once in this block, specifically in 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each complete hundred contributes 10 times for each digit, so 4 complete hundreds give 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's. Then, in the partial hundred, 4's tens digit appears 10 times, and 8's appears 9 times. So, total for tens place:\n- 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nWait, but that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, the difference here is 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in page numbers from 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, there's no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's count here is 0.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in all places.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each 10 pages, each digit 0-9 appears once in units place. 488 pages mean 48 full tens and 8 extra pages.\n- So, 48 times each digit, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), digits 1-8 appear once each.\n- So, 4 appears once more, and 8 appears once more. So, units place: 48 +1 =49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n- Now, the partial hundred from 401-488: 88 pages.\n- The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488).\n- For each tens digit, except the last one, it's 10 pages. The last one is 9 pages.\n- So, for 4 in tens place, it's in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- For 8 in tens place, it's in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n- So, total tens place:\n  - 4's: 40 +10=50\n  - 8's:40 +9=49\n- So, 50 vs 49, difference of 1.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n- So, 89 vs 0.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n- 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n- Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I first thought about it, I thought maybe the difference would be 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the partial blocks.\n\nLet me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449, 10 times. For 8, it's when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488, 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, so 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 +1=89. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as each page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - In the last 8 pages (481-488), digits 1-8 appear once each.\n   - Thus, 4 and 8 each appear 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 40 times in the tens place for the first 400 pages.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. The digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Thus, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place (400-488).\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Thus, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a particular digit appears, I can look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, maybe I should calculate how many 4's and 8's appear in each place (units, tens, hundreds) from 1 to 488 and then compare them.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers. But wait, actually, in the first block, 1-10, the digits 1-9 appear once, and 0 appears once in 10. But in the next block, 11-20, the units digits again go from 1-9 and then 0 in 20. So, every 10 numbers, each digit appears once in the units place.\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of times 4 appears would be the total number of complete blocks of 10 in 488, plus any extra numbers beyond that. Similarly for 8.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Actually, for each digit place, the number of times a specific digit appears can be calculated by dividing the total number by 10 for each place, considering the higher digits as well.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a specific digit appears can be determined by looking at how many times that digit cycles through 0-9 in that position.\n\nSo, for the units place:\n\nThe number of complete groups of 10 in 488 is 48 (since 48*10=480). So, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place. But wait, from 1 to 488, the first page is 1, so the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the last partial group. Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think from 0 to 487, which would make 488 numbers, but that might not be accurate because page numbers start at 1.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each position up to 488.\n\nLet me try this:\n\nFor the units place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488).\n\nIn each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, same for 8. So, in 48 complete groups, the units digit 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 +1 = 49. So, same number in units place.\n\nWait, but wait: from 1 to 488, the last number is 488, so the units digits go up to 8. So, in the incomplete group, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, yes, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units place: 49 times for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., 9 (90-99). Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 numbers.\n\nSo, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), same for 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, 10 times each. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times for 4, and 4*10 = 40 times for 8.\n\nNow, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410, but wait, 401-410 would have tens digit 0? Wait, no, 401-410 would have tens digit 0, but wait, 401 is 4-0-1, so tens digit is 0, but 410 is 4-1-0. Wait, no, 401-410 is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 0. Then 411-420 would have tens digit 1, and so on.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let me see how the tens digits work here.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except for 8, which appears only 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive? Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. But wait, 480 is 4-8-0, so tens digit is 8, and 488 is 4-8-8. So, from 480 to 489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears how many times? Let's see.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Similarly, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 401-410, tens digit is 0 (10 numbers). 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers). 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers). 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers). 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers). 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers). 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers). 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers). 481-490: tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers: 481-488, which is 8 numbers, not 9. Wait, 481 to 488 is 8 numbers, right? Because 488-481+1=8.\n\nWait, no, 481 to 488 is 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the incomplete hundred.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 9, but now I'm seeing it's 8. Hmm, let me recount. 480 is included in the previous group (471-480), where tens digit is 7? Wait, no, 471-480: 471 is 4-7-1, so tens digit 7, up to 480, which is 4-8-0. Wait, so 480 would be part of the tens digit 8? Or is 480 part of the previous group?\n\nWait, no, 480 is the first number with tens digit 8 in the 400s. So, 480-489 would have tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the incomplete hundred.\n\nWait, but when I count from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. Yes, that's 9 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, all within 401-488, so that's 10 times.\n\nSo, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place counts:\n\nFor 4's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the incomplete hundred, total 50.\n\nFor 8's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the incomplete hundred, total 49.\n\nWait, but wait, is that correct? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in each complete hundred, from 1-100, 101-200, etc., the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each. So, 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40.\n\nIn the incomplete hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nTens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, digits go from 1 to 4, since the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nHow about 8? The hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Complete groups:48, each contributing 1 to 4 and 8, so 48 each.\n- Incomplete group:8 numbers, 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once.\n- Total units:48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Complete hundreds:4, each contributing 10 to 4 and 8, so 40 each.\n- Incomplete hundred:401-488. Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- So, 4's:40+10=50; 8's:40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears equally in the units place every 10 numbers.\n   - Total complete groups of 10 in 488: 48 groups.\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one more '4' and one more '8'.\n   - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in each block of 100.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 blocks, each contributing 10 '4's and 10 '8's.\n   - Total from complete hundreds: 4*10 = 40 '4's and 4*10 = 40 '8's.\n   - In the incomplete hundred (401-488):\n     - '4' appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, in each group of ten, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, how many such groups are there up to 488?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of ten and an extra 8 pages (481-488). In each of the 48 complete groups, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place.

So in this partial group, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So adding that, the units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because 481-488 is 8 pages, so the units digits go from 1 to 8, but 488 is the last page. So, in the units place of the last partial group, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, the total for units place is 48*1 +1 =49 4's and 48*1 +1=49 8's. So, units place has equal number of 4's and 8's.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49) and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and an additional 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10=40 4's. Similarly, 8 appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place from the full hundreds.\n\nNow, looking at the additional 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times, but only up to 88. So, in 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because 481-488 is only 8 pages.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digits go as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nSo, each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears exactly 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times (since 481-488 is 8 pages). \n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, meaning 8 times. So, in the tens place for the last partial hundred (401-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 4*10 (from the full hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50 4's. \n\nFor 8's in the tens place, it's 4*10 (from the full hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48 8's.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times. So, 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 in the hundreds place would be for pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 4's, 49 8's\n- Tens place: 50 4's, 48 8's\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's\n\nAdding them up:\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check each place.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. So 48 each, plus the last 8 pages: 481-488. Units digits 1-8. So 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So total units: 48+1=49 4's, 48+1=49 8's. That's correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. There are 4 full hundreds, so 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So total tens: 40+10=50 4's, 40+8=48 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again. Pages 400-488: how many pages is that? 488-400+1=89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 89 4's. Correct. And no 8's in hundreds place because the book doesn't reach 800. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the final difference is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete groups (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each group of 100 pages contributes ten 4's and ten 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (400 pages), contributing 40 each.\n   - The last 88 pages (401-488) contribute ten 4's (441-450) and eight 8's (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's.\n   - There are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a particular digit appears, I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. So, I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. I'll do the same for the digit 8 and then find the difference between the total number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with the digit 4, let's count how many times it appears in each place.\n\nFirst, the units place. In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14; and so on. \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of ten and then an additional 8 pages (481-488). In each of these 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (page 484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. Specifically, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. \n\nLet me calculate how many such blocks there are within 488 pages. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the second is 140-149 (another 10), third is 240-249 (10), fourth is 340-349 (10), and the fifth would be 440-449 (10). That's five blocks in total, each contributing 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50 times. \n\nWait, but does 440-449 fall within 488 pages? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place from pages 400 to 488. Let's see, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Again, in every block of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, similar to the 4's, each block of ten contributes one 8 in the units place.\n\nNumber of complete blocks of ten in 488 pages is 48, as before, and the remaining 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 blocks, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the remaining 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block would be 480-488.\n\nLet me count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), second is 180-189 (10), third is 280-289 (10), fourth is 380-389 (10), and fifth is 480-488. \n\nEach of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. The fifth block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the tens place, each of these numbers has an 8, so that's 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last block, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 8 in tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then 480-488: 9 numbers. So, 10 +10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, hold on, units was 49, tens was 49, so 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus in 481-488, 484 has a 4 in units, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each 10, so 5*10=50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus in 481-488, 488 has an 8 in units, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens: 5 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488). Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9. Total tens: 40 +9=49.\n- Hundreds: 0, as 800-899 is beyond 488.\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** In each block of 10 pages, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and an additional 8 pages (481-488). Thus, 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears once every 10 pages. With 48 complete blocks and the last 8 pages, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 40, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI think the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once, and the same goes for the digit 8. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4), and 8 appears once (at page 8). \n\nNow, how many such sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then an additional 8 pages (481-488). In each of these 48 sets, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, the count for both digits would be 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total count for units place would be 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because 488 is the last page. So, pages 481-488: the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, yes, each digit appears once in the units place in this partial set. So, units place counts: 48 full sets (48*1 each) plus 1 each in the partial set, so total 49 for both 4 and 8 in units place.\n\nWait, but actually, 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8 in the last partial set. So, 484 is included, and 488 is included. So, yes, each appears once.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, and similarly, 8 appears in 80-89. So, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of these 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, that's 4*10 = 40 for each digit in the tens place so far.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit here can be 0 (for 401-410), 1 (411-420), up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in this range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, but wait, 401-488: let's see, 401-410 has tens digit 0, 411-420 has 1, 421-430 has 2, 431-440 has 3, 441-450 has 4, 451-460 has 5, 461-470 has 6, 471-480 has 7, and 481-488 has 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 441-450 is part of 401-488, so the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, but 440 is included in 401-488? Wait, no, 401-488 starts at 401, so 440 is within that range. So, from 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times here. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here, whereas 4 appears 10 times (440-449). So, adding to the previous counts:\n\nTens place: 4 appears 4*10 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n8 appears 4*10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Because in each full hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place, and in the last partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total tens place counts: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nWait, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in 1-999, the hundreds digit would be 8 for pages 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each full set of 10 pages contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8.\n- There are 48 full sets in 480 pages (48*10=480), contributing 48 each.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have 4 at 484 and 8 at 488, so 1 each.\n- Total units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n- Each full hundred contributes 10 each.\n- 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 each.\n- The remaining 88 pages (401-488) have:\n  - 440-449: 10 times 4 in tens place.\n  - 480-488: 9 times 8 in tens place.\n- So, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 times 4 in hundreds place.\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place, so 0.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, I think it's 48 full sets, which would give me 48 fours in the units place. But wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the last set is 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the units digit 4 would appear in 484, which is within the range. So maybe it's 48 times? Wait, let me think again. For each ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490, but since we stop at 488, the last set is incomplete. But the units digit 4 appears once in each complete set of ten. So the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete tens, which is 48, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the last set is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So in the 481-490 set, the units digit 4 would be at 484, which is within the range. So actually, each set of ten contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 is 488, so 488 is the last page. So from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. But wait, let me check: 1-10: 4 is at 4, 11-20: 14, 21-30:24, ..., 481-490:484. So yes, 48 fours in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes ten 4's in the tens place. So how many such blocks are there? Let's see: \n\n- 40-49: that's one block, contributing 10 fours.\n- 140-149: another block, 10 fours.\n- 240-249: another, 10 fours.\n- 340-349: another, 10 fours.\n- 440-449: another, 10 fours.\n\nWait, but does the book go up to 488? So 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So 5*10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 440-449 is within 488, yes. So that's correct.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So that's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So from 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, for every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many tens? 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So 48 eights in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 1-10: 8 is at 8, 11-20:18, ..., 481-490:488. So yes, 48 eights in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the last block. So each block contributes ten 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so it's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 489, but since we stop at 488, the tens digit is still 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So each full block contributes ten 8's, but the last block only contributes nine because we stop at 488.\n\nWait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is nine numbers. So for the tens place, how many blocks have 8 in the tens place? \n\n- 80-89: ten numbers, so ten 8's.\n- 180-189: ten 8's.\n- 280-289: ten 8's.\n- 380-389: ten 8's.\n- 480-488: nine 8's.\n\nSo total in the tens place: 4 blocks of ten, which is 4*10=40, plus nine from the last block, so 40+9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Each block like 80-89 has ten numbers, so ten 8's in the tens place. Similarly for 180-189, etc. The last block, 480-488, has nine numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So yes, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 eights.\n\nWait, let me double-check: units place 48, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So 48+49=97.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me go through it again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50 (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449)\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488)\nTotal: 48+50+89=187\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 49 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 48+49=97\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's, the blocks are:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 fours\n- 140-149: 10 fours\n- 240-249: 10 fours\n- 340-349: 10 fours\n- 440-449: 10 fours\n\nThat's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 8's, the blocks are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 eights\n- 180-189: 10 eights\n- 280-289: 10 eights\n- 380-389: 10 eights\n- 480-488: 9 eights\n\nSo that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for both 4's and 8's: 48 each, because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but actually, in the units place, for each ten numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the number of times 4 is in the units digit, which is every 10 numbers, so floor(488/10)=48 times, but wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but let me check: 488 includes 488, so the last occurrence of 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within 488. So yes, 48 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place, the last occurrence is at 488, so 48 times as well.\n\nSo the counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 187 fours and 97 eights. So 187 - 97 is 90. That seems right.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's would have more, but 89 is correct because from 400 to 488 is 89 numbers.\n\nWait, 488 - 400 +1 = 89, yes.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the number of 4's is 187 and the number of 8's is 97, so the difference is 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (once every 10 numbers).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (five blocks of 10 numbers each).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400 to 488).\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (once every 10 numbers).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (four blocks of 10 and one block of 9).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI think the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the totals for each digit, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the digit 4 appears once (page 4) and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). This pattern repeats every 10 pages. Now, since the book has 488 pages, I can divide 488 by 10 to find out how many complete groups of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole groups, there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages. \n\nWait, no, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so that means there are 48 full groups of 10 pages and then 8 additional pages. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. Therefore, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from the complete groups) plus one more if the last page in the incomplete group has a 4. But since the last group ends at 488, the units digits go up to 8, so in the incomplete group, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place in this last group? Yes, page 484. So that adds one more 4. Similarly, 8 appears in page 488, so that's one more 8. \n\nSo, units place: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's = 48 + 1 = 49. So, they are equal in the units place. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49 (10 times) and 8 for pages 80-89 (10 times). So, in each block of 100 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, there are 4 complete blocks of 100 pages (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 complete blocks, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each block, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, in the incomplete block from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the tens place here? Looking at pages 440-449, which is 10 pages, so the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). Wait, actually, from 480 to 489 would be 10 pages, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the incomplete block.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 4's = 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 (from incomplete) = 50. 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's are more by 1 here.\n\nNow, let's look at the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. So, from 1-99, hundreds digit is 0 (since they are two-digit numbers), but I think we can consider the hundreds digit as 0 for these. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, 200-299 is 2, 300-399 is 3, and 400-488 is 4. \n\nWait, but page numbers start at 1, so pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100 onwards are three-digit. So, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Looking at the range, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nTherefore, hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nSo, adding up all the digits:\n\nFor 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full groups (480 pages) and 8 extra pages.\n- In the units place, 48 groups give 48 4's and 48 8's.\n- The last 8 pages (481-488) have 4 in the units place at 484 and 8 at 488.\n- So, units: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 pages have 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 complete hundreds (400 pages) give 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's.\n- The last 88 pages (401-488) have tens digits from 0 to 8.\n- 440-449: 10 4's in tens place.\n- 480-488: 9 8's in tens place.\n- So, total tens: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages with 4 in hundreds place.\n- 800-888 would have 8's, but since we only go up to 488, 8's in hundreds place = 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 pages have 48 full groups of 10 and 8 extra pages.\n   - 48 groups: 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Extra pages (481-488): 4 at 484 and 8 at 488.\n   - Total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 pages contribute 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - 400 pages: 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Pages 401-488: 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488: 89 4's.\n   - 8's: 0, as the book doesn't reach 800.\n   - Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I can look at each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds. So, maybe I should count how many 4's and 8's appear in the units place, then the tens place, and then the hundreds place, and sum them up.\n\nLet's start with the 4's. \n\nFirst, the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. So, that gives us 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. But wait, the last block might not be complete. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last complete block ends at 480. So, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place beyond 480. So, 48 times is correct for the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times. For example, from 40 to 49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140 to 149, and so on. Let me figure out how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks is that? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then each subsequent hundred adds another. So, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred block except the last one, there's a full block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. Let's count them: \n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 times 10 is 50. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, meaning 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. \n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, which is 48, giving 48 occurrences. But wait, let's check if 488 is included. The last number with 8 in the units place before 488 is 488 itself, which ends with 8. So, actually, it's 49 occurrences because 488 is the 49th number ending with 8. Wait, no, 488 is the 49th such number? Let me think. Wait, 8 is the first, then 18 is the second, so 8*1=8, 8*2=16, but no, each 10 numbers adds one. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 = 48*10 + 8, so 48 full tens and then the 49th 8. So, yes, 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is only up to 488. So, how many such blocks are there?\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 4 full blocks contributing 10 each, and the last block contributing 9. So, total in the tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place for 8. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 8 + 10*(n-1). We want the last term to be \u2264488. So, 8 + 10*(n-1) \u2264488. Subtract 8: 10*(n-1) \u2264480. Divide by 10: n-1 \u226448. So, n \u226449. So, there are 49 numbers ending with 8, so 49 occurrences in the units place. That checks out.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, we had 49 occurrences, so total 98 8's.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49, which is correct.\n\nSo, 187 4's minus 98 8's equals 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 89 more 4's.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once every ten numbers. \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, I can calculate how many complete sets of ten there are. Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times. But wait, for the last partial set, which is 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so digits 1 through 8 appear once each, and 9 and 0 don't appear in this partial set.\n\nSo, for the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times (once in each complete set of ten) plus once in the partial set (484), making it 49 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 48 times (once in each complete set) plus once in the partial set (488), so also 49 times. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 each appear 49 times. That means the count is equal here, so no difference in the units place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit changes every ten numbers. For example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, then from 10-19 it's 1, 20-29 it's 2, and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8.\n\nI think the approach here is similar. Each tens digit appears for a block of ten numbers. So, for each digit in the tens place, how many times does it appear? Let's see, for digit 0 in the tens place, that's pages 1-9, which is 9 pages, but since we're considering the tens place, it's actually 0 appearing 9 times, but wait, in the tens place, 0 appears only in the numbers 1-9, but each of those is a single digit, so maybe I should think of them as 01-09, but in reality, page numbers don't have leading zeros, so the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, but each of these pages is a single digit, so the tens digit isn't actually printed. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider each range of 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each tens digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place within 1-100. Then, from 101-200, the tens digit cycles again, so each digit 0-9 appears another 10 times, and so on.\n\nBut since our book only goes up to 488, I need to adjust for that. Let me see, 488 is less than 500, so we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488.\n\nWait, actually, 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So that's five segments. Now, in each of the first four segments (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each tens digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for each of these four segments, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the same for 8. Then, in the last segment, 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the last segment, whereas in the first four segments, it appeared 10 times each. So, total for the tens place, 8 appears 4*10 + 8 = 48 times. Similarly, for digit 4, in the first four segments, it appears 10 times each, and in the last segment, from 441-450, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 401-488, so 441-450 is within that range, so that's 10 times. So, digit 4 appears 4*10 + 10 = 50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490). But since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 is only present in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, for the tens digit 4, in 401-488, it appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Therefore, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 4*10 (from the first four segments) plus 10 (from 441-450) = 50 times. Digit 8 appears 4*10 (from the first four segments) plus 8 (from 481-488) = 48 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times. So, 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, 3, 2, or 1, but never 8. Therefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, that's a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me summarize:\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times. Difference: 0.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times. Difference: +2.\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. Difference: +89.\n\nAdding these up: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's in total.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place: 488 pages, so 48 full tens and 8 extra. Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, plus in the last 8 pages, digits 1-8 appear once each. So, 4 appears once in the last 8, making total 49, same for 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for four full hundreds (1-400), that's 4*10 = 40 times each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for digit 4, it's in 441-450, which is 10 times, so total 40 + 10 = 50. For digit 8, it's in 481-488, which is 8 times, so total 40 + 8 = 48. So, 50 - 48 = +2. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so hundreds digit is 4, 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. So, 89 difference. So, total difference is 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (from 1-480).\n   - In the last 8 pages (481-488), digits 1-8 each appear once.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.).\n   - For four full hundreds (1-400), each digit appears 40 times.\n   - In 401-488:\n     - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n   - Difference: +2.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, appearing 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference: +89.\n\nSumming the differences: 0 (units) + 2 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 91.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{91}"

After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's consider each place separately.\n\n1. **Units place:** In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). Each complete block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8. So, the number 484 has a 4 in the units place, adding one more. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Similarly, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (each contributing 10 4's in the tens place) and then an extra 88 numbers (440-488). Each complete block gives 10 4's, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial block (440-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, that's another 10 4's. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** In the tens place, the digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, how many complete blocks? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete blocks (each giving 10 8's in the tens place) and then the partial block. Each complete block (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) gives 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial block (480-488), the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers: 480-488. So, that's 9 8's. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, subtracting the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full decades (48*1) + 1 in the last 8 numbers (484) \u2192 49\n- Tens: 4 full centuries (4*10) + 10 in 440-449 \u2192 50\n- Hundreds: 89 numbers from 400-488 \u2192 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full decades + 1 in 488 \u2192 49\n- Tens: 4 full centuries (4*10) + 9 in 480-488 \u2192 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit (like 4 or 8) appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then checking if there's any remainder.\n\nBut wait, since the book has 488 pages, let me see how many complete groups of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place, and then from 1 to 8, each appears once more because of the remaining 8 pages. \n\nWait, no, actually, the remainder affects the last partial group. So, for the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times for each complete set of 10, and in the last partial set (pages 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in the units place here. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in the units place in the last partial set. \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 (from complete sets) + 1 (from last partial set) = 49. \n\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 (from complete sets) + 1 (from last partial set) = 49. \n\nWait, that seems the same, but I might have made a mistake because the last page is 488, so the units digits go up to 8, so 8 is included once, but 4 is included once as well because 484 is within 481-488. So, maybe both 4 and 8 each get an extra count in the units place. So, units place gives 49 for both.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 numbers. So, for each 100 pages, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, that's 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nSo, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and similarly for 8. \n\nBut wait, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in 400-499, but our book only goes up to 488, so the 4 in the hundreds place appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, no, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's focus on the tens place first.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, same for 8. So, in 400 pages, that would be 4 times 10, which is 40 for each digit. But our book is only 488 pages, so after 400, we have 88 more pages. \n\nIn the 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 as follows: 401-410 (tens digit 0), 411-420 (tens digit 1), ..., 481-490 (tens digit 8), but since we only go up to 488, the last partial set is 481-488, which has a tens digit of 8 for the first 8 pages (481-488). So, in the tens place for the 401-488 range, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nWait, let me think. From 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Each full set of 10 pages (like 401-410, 411-420, etc.) will have a specific tens digit. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, there are 10 pages, except the last one, which is only 8 pages (481-488). \n\nSo, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is a full 10 pages. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the 401-488 range.\n\nWait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but we only have up to 488, so it's 9 pages. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449), and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). \n\nTherefore, in the tens place, for the entire book:\n\n- Digit 4: 4 times 10 (from each hundred) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times.\nWait, no, wait. Wait, each hundred contributes 10 times in the tens place for each digit. So, for 400 pages, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears once more in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. \n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, total for tens place:\n\n- 4's: 4*10 (from each hundred) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50\n- 8's: 4*10 (from each hundred) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49\n\nWait, that makes sense because in the last partial hundred, 480-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 10.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 49\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, but 300-399 would have hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 would have hundreds digit 4. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me recheck the units place. For units digit 4: each 10 pages, 4 appears once. 488 / 10 = 48 with remainder 8. So, 48 times, and then in the last 8 pages (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units place, so 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8 appears once in units place in 488, so 48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in tens place. 4 hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, so total 50. For 8, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so total 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different. Let me see if I missed anything.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 times, correct. Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nIn the tens place, for 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 4's tens: 50, 8's tens:49.\n\nUnits place: 49 each.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times. Correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount, especially in the tens and units places. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For units digit 4: number of times = floor(488/10) + (1 if 488 mod 10 >=4 else 0)\nWait, 488 /10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8: floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10=8, which is >=8, so add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For tens digit 4: Each 100 pages, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds? 4 complete hundreds (1-400). Each contributes 10 times for each digit, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 40 +10=50.\n\nFor tens digit 8: Similarly, 4 complete hundreds contribute 4*10=40. In the remaining 88 pages, tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 -480 +1=9). So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- Hundreds digit 8: never appears, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n   - Remaining pages: 8 (481-488).\n   - **4's:** 48 times in complete sets + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - **8's:** 48 times in complete sets + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (1-400).\n   - **4's:** 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Plus 10 in 440-449 \u2192 Total 50.\n   - **8's:** 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Plus 9 in 480-488 \u2192 Total 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** From 400-488: 89 times.\n   - **8's:** Does not appear \u2192 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That means the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), or three-digit (100-488).\n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each position for both 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there up to 488?\n\nWell, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, from 1 to 488, the last group is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the 48th group ends at 480, and then 481-488 is the 49th group, but in that group, the units digit 4 appears at 484. So actually, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 49, because from 1 to 480, it's 48 times, and then 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because from 1 to 480, every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place, so 480 / 10 = 48. Then from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, the units digit 4 occurs once at 484. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but actually, 488 is the last page. So let me check: The first 4 in the units place is at 4, then every 10 after that. So the last 4 in the units place before 488 is 484, which is within 488. So yes, 48 full groups of 10 (up to 480) give 48 fours, and then 484 is the 49th. So units place 4's: 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So how many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1-488, the blocks are:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So tens place 4's: 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs in numbers from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. But wait, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers. But wait, 488 is included, so 488-400+1=89. So hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is the first, 401, ..., up to 488. So yes, 89 numbers. So 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let's add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, but let's see. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place: 8,18,28,..., up to 488.\n\nSo how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 occurs at 488 as well. So that's 48 +1=49 times.\n\nWait, let me check: From 1-480, that's 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then from 481-488, the units digit 8 occurs at 488, so that's one more, making it 49.\n\nSo units place 8's: 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but only up to 488.\n\nEach block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block, which is only 9 numbers (480-488) because 489 is beyond 488.\n\nWait, no, 480-489 is a full block, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 in the block 480-489 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So each block except the last contributes 10, and the last contributes 9.\n\nWait, but let me think again: The blocks are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-489: but we only go up to 488, so 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo that's 4 blocks with 10 numbers each, and 1 block with 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 4*10=40 +9=49. So yes, 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place occurs in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So total 8's: 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nLet me recount the 4's.\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), there's 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So units place 4's:49.\n\nTens place: The blocks where tens digit is 4 are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks *10=50. So 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow for 8's.\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then in the last group (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place. So 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: Blocks are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), each with an 8 in the tens place. So 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: There are no page numbers from 800-899, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) =90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the tens place in 8's. For example, in the block 480-488, how many numbers have an 8 in the tens place? From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, up to 488 is 4 8 8. So that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So yes, 9.\n\nSimilarly, in the block 80-89, each number has an 8 in the tens place, so 10 numbers. Same for 180-189, etc.\n\nSo yes, 49 for units, 49 for tens, 0 for hundreds, total 98.\n\nSo the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be a bit high. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the 4's in the tens place, 5 blocks of 10, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place 4's:49, yes.\n\nSo 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0, total 98.\n\nSo the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach to verify. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAnother way to count digits is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated based on higher digits and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, I can think of the total number of digits printed.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to stick with my initial method since it seems consistent.\n\nWait, another way: Let's consider all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nFor each page number, we can represent it as a three-digit number by adding leading zeros if necessary, so pages 1-9 are 001-009, 10-99 are 010-099, and 100-488 are 100-488.\n\nThis way, each page number is a three-digit number, and we can analyze each digit position.\n\nSo, for each digit position (hundreds, tens, units), we can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nHundreds place: As before, 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 4 in blocks 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.\n\nEach of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks *10=50.\n\nUnits place: The units digit is 4 in numbers 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many such numbers? As before, 488//10=48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then 484 is the 49th. So 49.\n\nSo total 4's:89+50+49=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nHundreds place: No numbers from 800-899, so 0.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in blocks 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nEach of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40.\n\nThe last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nUnits place: The units digit is 8 in numbers 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many such numbers? 488//10=48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then 488 is the 49th. So 49.\n\nSo total 8's:0 (hundreds) +49 (tens)+49 (units)=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nSo, I think my initial calculation was correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have those totals, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0, then 11 to 20, and so on. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place every 10 numbers. So, for 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 do we have? Let me calculate 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48. Similarly, the number of 8's would also be 48. But wait, I have those 8 extra numbers from 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits in these. The units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times. That means they cancel each other out when considering the difference. \n\nNext, I'll move on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 numbers. For example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, from 10-19 it's 1, and so on. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, for 488 pages, how many complete sets of 100 do we have? Let's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete sets and then 88 extra numbers (401 to 488). \n\nIn each complete set of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and the same for 8 (e.g., 80-89). So, for 4 complete sets, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 for each digit. Now, let's look at the remaining 88 numbers (401 to 488). The tens digit in these numbers goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-488). \n\nWait, but I'm only interested in when the tens digit is 4 or 8. Let's see, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-488. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). \n\nWait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in 440-449, and the digit 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. \n\nSo, adding this to the previous 40 from the complete sets, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8's, it's 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nWait, let me confirm that. Each complete set of 100 contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 sets would give 4*10=40 for each. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So yes, that's correct. So, total for tens place: 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+9=49 for 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 numbers. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, it's 1, 200-299 it's 2, 300-399 it's 3, and 400-488 it's 4. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFor 488 pages, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nUnits place:\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing 1 for 4 and 1 for 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have 4 in 484 and 8 in 488, so adding 1 each, making 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 full centuries (1-400), each contributing 10 for 4 and 10 for 8, so 40 each.\n- Then, from 401-488, 488 - 400 = 88 numbers. The tens digit cycles every 10, so 401-410: tens digit 0, 411-420: 1, ..., 480-488: 8. So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here?\n- 440-449: 10 numbers, so 10 times for 4.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last), so 9 times for 8.\n- So, total for 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Total for 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\nThat seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\nSo, 8's here: 0.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - 488 pages mean 48 full decades (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - In the units place, '4' appears 48 times in the full decades and once in the extra pages (484), totaling 49.\n   - Similarly, '8' appears 48 times in the full decades and once in the extra pages (488), totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 488 pages mean 4 full centuries (400 pages) and 88 extra pages (401-488).\n   - In the tens place, '4' appears 40 times in the full centuries and 10 times in 440-449, totaling 50.\n   - '8' appears 40 times in the full centuries and 9 times in 480-488, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (total '4's) - 98 (total '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a particular digit appears, I can look at each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014and calculate how many times the digit appears in each place. So, I'll need to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place, and then sum them up for each digit. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the 4's. I'll first check the units place. For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 pages (481 to 488). In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once in 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place for 4's. In the tens place, a 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times. For example, from 40 to 49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140 to 149, and so on. Let's see how many such blocks there are in 488 pages. The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so the first block is 1-99, then 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the block 40-49, which is 10 times. Then, in the block 140-149, another 10 times. Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349 each contribute 10 times. Now, the last block is 400-488. In this block, the tens digit is 4 from 440 to 449, which is another 10 times. Wait, but 440 to 449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, how many blocks is that? Let me count: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on. The last block is 400-488. So, the tens digit in 400-488 goes from 0 to 8. So, the 4 in the tens place occurs from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 blocks of 10 each, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The hundreds digit is 4 for each page from 400 to 488, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. So, that's 89.\n\nSo, total 4's would be units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for 8's. Starting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, the partial block from 481 to 488 has units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8's. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, 480-488, which only has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens digit is 8 for 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place for that block.\n\nSo, how many blocks are there? 80-89: 10 8's, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8's. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the pages from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's would be units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I had 188 4's and 98 8's, which would mean 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's. But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me verify the units place for 4's: 488 pages. Every 10 pages, one 4 in the units place. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial ten is 481-488, which includes 484, so one more 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 pages. So, 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: same as 4's, 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since the book doesn't reach 800. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something in the hundreds place for 8's, but since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never goes beyond 4, so no 8's there. So, yes, 90 is the correct difference.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Total blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages.\n   - 48 * 1 = 48.\n   - Partial block (481-488): 484 has a 4 in the units place, so +1.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total blocks of 10: 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages.\n   - 48 * 1 = 48.\n   - Partial block (481-488): 488 has an 8 in the units place, so +1.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 8's, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9.\n   - Total blocks: 4 full blocks and 1 partial block.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: (4 * 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should analyze each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Maybe I can count how many times 4 appears in each position and do the same for 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once in the units place. \n\nHow many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481 to 488). In each complete set, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Now, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, the difference in the units place is 0.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears ten times in a set of 100. For example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 80-89, also 10 times. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete set of 100, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 sets, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. Now, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see, in 401-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, it's 1; 420-429, it's 2; and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. \n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? Well, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. \n\nWait, hold on, 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for all 9 of those. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the extra 88 pages. \n\nTherefore, adding that to the previous 40 times each, the total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 times for 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times, so the difference is 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 has the hundreds digit as 4, right? So, let's break it down.\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so neither 4 nor 8 appears here in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so neither 4 nor 8 appears here.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so again, neither 4 nor 8 appears.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so still no 4 or 8.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears here. How many times? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. Therefore, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place.\n\n- Units place: 0 more 4's\n- Tens place: 1 more 4's\n- Hundreds place: 89 more 4's\n\nAdding these up: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with the units place: 488 pages, so for units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, with an extra 8 pages (481-488) where units digits go up to 8. So, 4 appears once in units place (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, same for 8's: 49. So difference is 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds (1-400) give 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. For 4 in tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 times. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. So, difference of 1. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: Only 400-488 has 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so difference is 89. \n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90. \n\nYes, that seems right. So, the total number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (from 1 to 480).\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the first 400 pages.\n   - Pages 401-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nSumming the differences: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears in a range of numbers, I can analyze each digit place separately\u2014like the units place, tens place, and hundreds place. So, I'll need to check how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these places and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll consider each place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, it's 4; from 11 to 20, it's 14; and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, I can divide 488 by 10 to see how many complete blocks of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481 to 488). In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. The digit 4 appears once here as well (484). So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times. For example, from 40 to 49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401 to 488. In each complete block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the partial block from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440 to 449. That's another 10 numbers. So, adding that to the previous total, we have 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but hold on, 401 to 488 includes 440 to 449, so that's correct. So, the tens place gives us 50 occurrences of 4.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. 488 minus 400 plus 1 is 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, for 488 pages, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8. Each complete block contributes 1, so 48 times. The partial block from 481 to 488 has units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, units place gives us 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences of 8.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many complete blocks of 100 are there? 4 complete blocks as before. So, each block contributes 10 occurrences, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the partial block from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 40 (from the complete blocks) plus 9 (from the partial block) = 49.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 401 to 488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So yes, 9 times. So, total tens place occurrences are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 occurrences of 8.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 8 in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. For the tens place, in the partial block from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, correct. So, 40 from the complete blocks plus 9 gives 49. Units place is 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. That seems right.\n\nAnother thing to check: when counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 numbers, and in the partial block, 440-449, which is another 10. So, 4 blocks times 10 is 40, plus 10 in the partial block, totaling 50. That's correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, the partial block gives 9, so 40 + 9 = 49. Units place is 49, so total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the units place for 4's, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? For every 10 numbers, it's once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is the only one with 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, same logic: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last partial ten, 488 has 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. For 488 pages, there are 48 full blocks (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each full block contributes 1, totaling 48. The last block contributes 1 (484). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every block of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). For 488 pages, there are 4 full blocks (400 numbers), contributing 40. The last block (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. For 488 pages, 48 full blocks and 1 in the last block (488). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every block of 100, 8 appears 10 times. For 488 pages, 4 full blocks contribute 40. The last block includes 480-488, contributing 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first step is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. In the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place every 10 numbers. So, for the units place, the number of times 4 appears is equal to the number of times 8 appears, right? Because each digit 0-9 cycles equally.\n\nBut wait, the book has 488 pages, which isn't a multiple of 10. So maybe the last set of 10 isn't complete. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, and then the digits 1 to 8 appear once more in the last partial group. So, for the units place, the count for 4 is 48 times, and since 4 is less than 8, it doesn't appear in the extra 8 numbers. Wait, no, 4 is less than 8, so in the extra numbers from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times in the full groups and once more in the extra, so 48 + 1 = 49. So in the units place, 4 and 8 each appear 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. If I have 488 pages, that's 488 numbers. The units digit cycles every 10, so 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, with a remainder of 8. So each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. Therefore, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So units place contributes equally to both digits.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see. The book has 488 pages, so the tens digit goes through 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Since there are 4 full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 4-8-8). So, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488. So in the tens place, 4 appears once in 440-449, and 8 appears once in 480-488. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit in 401-488 goes from 0 to 8, so each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears only 9 times because we stop at 488. Wait, no, let me think again. \n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. The tens digit cycles every 10, so from 401-410, tens digit is 0 (10 numbers), 411-420, tens digit is 1 (10 numbers), and so on up to 481-490, but since we stop at 488, that's 8 numbers (481-488). So in the tens place, for 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 10 numbers, 1 for 10, 2 for 10, 3 for 10, 4 for 10, 5 for 10, 6 for 10, 7 for 10, 8 for 8 numbers. So in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 8 times (480-488). Therefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the last partial hundred, totaling 50. For 8's, it's 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 8 in the last partial hundred, totaling 48. So in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Each full hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40 for 4's and 4*10=40 for 8's. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So for each tens digit, how many times does it appear? From 401-488, the tens digits go 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-488). Each of these tens digits appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 8 times because 488 is the end. So for 4's in the tens place in the last partial hundred, it's 10 times (440-449), and for 8's, it's 8 times (480-488). Therefore, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSo in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So pages 1-99 have no hundreds digit, pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8's? In the hundreds place, 8 would appear if there were pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo summarizing the hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) equals 91. So there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So total units: 48 +1 =49 for both. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So 4 full hundreds give 40 each. Then in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles 0-8. For 4's, it's 10 times (440-449), and for 8's, it's 8 times (480-488). So 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +8=48 for 8's. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 49 +50 +89=188, and 49 +48 +0=97. 188-97=91. So yes, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any errors in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should start by figuring out how many times the digit 4 appears in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the counts for each digit, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, looking at the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (40-49). So how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So there are 4 complete blocks, each contributing 10 instances of 4 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (from 400 to 488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (440-449), but wait, 488 is less than 499, so from 400 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So the tens digit is 4 for numbers 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440 to 449 is within 400-488, right? So that's another 10. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I made a mistake there. Let me correct that. From 1-488, the hundreds place starts at 1, so the first block is 1-99, then 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So for the tens place, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, so the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (440-449). So total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So yes, 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1-488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, and then in the last partial group (481-488), 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place, so 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. So 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So 89 times. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, in each group of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In each block of 100, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So 4 blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, that's 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So in the tens place, from 400-488, the digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So yes, 9 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So 0 times.\n\nSo total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So 4's: 188, 8's: 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. For the tens place, 50 times, and units 49, so total 4's: 89 + 50 = 139, plus 49 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8 again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So in each block of 100, it's 10 times, but in the last block, it's only 9. So 4 blocks contribute 40, plus 9, total 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

I'll consider each place separately.\n\n1. **Units place**: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, in the 488th page, the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be at 484, which is within 488. So, actually, it's 49 fours because 488 is beyond 484, but the 49th set would be 490, which is beyond 488. Wait, no, because 488 is less than 490, so the number of complete sets is 48, but the last set would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 appears once more at 484, which is within 488. So actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Wait, no, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, we have 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So the number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears in 1-488, which is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, and 488 mod 10 is 8, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 appears at 4,14,...,484, which is 48 times because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, 48 fours in the units place.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (sets of 10) plus any extra if the last page is beyond the next multiple. So, for 488 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the number of times 4 is the last digit, which is from 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms in this sequence is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 fours in the units place.\n\nWait, that makes sense because 484 is the 48th term, but starting from 4 as the first term, so 4 is the 1st, 14 is the 2nd, ..., 484 is the 49th. So, 49 fours in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, for the tens digit, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, but 540-549 would be beyond. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach block of 100 pages has a block where the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 401-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but we only go up to 488.\n\nSo, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10 pages)\nFrom 101-200: 140-149 (10 pages)\nFrom 201-300: 240-249 (10 pages)\nFrom 301-400: 340-349 (10 pages)\nFrom 401-488: 440-449 (10 pages) because 449 is less than 488, so that's another 10 pages.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 pages, so that's 5 blocks of 10 pages each, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49: 10\n140-149: 10\n240-249:10\n340-349:10\n440-449:10\nTotal: 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that.\n\n49 +50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4, but let's check. The units digit is 8 for 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 more than 480. So, the sequence is 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The tens digit is 8 for 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nFirst, from 80-89: 10 pages\n180-189:10\n280-289:10\n380-389:10\n480-488:9 pages (since 489 is beyond 488)\nSo, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89:10\n180-189:10\n280-289:10\n380-389:10\n480-488:9\nTotal: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 8 for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place. Since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, zero.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check each step.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place (1st digit from the right):**\n     - The digit '4' appears in the units place for every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n     - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit from the right):**\n     - The digit '4' appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in each hundred: 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n     - Number of blocks: 5 (from 1-400 and 401-488).\n     - Number of occurrences: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit from the right):**\n     - The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n     - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - The digit '8' appears in the units place for every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n     - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - The digit '8' appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in each hundred: 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n     - Number of blocks: 5, but the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers.\n     - Number of occurrences: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book has only 488 pages.\n     - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then compare the totals.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4), and 8 appears once (at page 8). This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. \n\nNow, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). In each full group, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place, so that's 48 times each. But in the extra 8 pages, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial group, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, so far, they're equal in the units place.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 40-49. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89. \n\nBut wait, the book only goes up to 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, right? Let me see. From 1-100, the tens digits for 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. Then from 101-200, the same pattern repeats: 40-49 and 80-89, so another 10 each. Similarly, from 201-300, another 10 each, and from 301-400, another 10 each. \n\nBut wait, 400-488 is the last part. So, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, does that mean 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last segment?\n\nWait, let me clarify. The tens digit in 480-488 is 8, so that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place, and 4 appears 10 times (440-449). \n\nSo, let's calculate the total for the tens place. From 1-400, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place? Well, each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) contributes 10 each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 = 40 for 4 and 40 for 8. Then, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is already ahead by one in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be where 8 appears in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that seems like a big difference. Let me double-check my calculations because 188 - 98 = 90, which seems quite a lot. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me recount the hundreds place for 4. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, I had 50 for 4 and 49 for 8. Let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred block contributes 10 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That seems right.\n\nUnits place: 49 each. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 for 4, and 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 for 8. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct, but I feel like 90 is a large number. Maybe I should check another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and see if the counts make sense.\n\nLet me try another approach. For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 488 // 10 = 48 groups, with a remainder of 8.\n\nIn each group of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n\nSo, 48 * 1 = 48 for each, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for each.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100: 488 // 100 = 4 groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), with a remainder of 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each group of 100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each group, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSo, 4 groups * 10 = 40 for each.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 pages. For tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSo, adding to the previous counts: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so 4 and 8 don't appear here. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total for 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal for 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. For example, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But does that include the number 400? Yes, because 400 is included.\n\nIn the tens place, for 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place, which is correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits printed.\n\nEach page from 1-9: 1 digit each, total 9 digits.\n\n10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each, total 180 digits.\n\n100-488: 389 pages, 3 digits each, total 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, number of 4's: 188, number of 8's: 98.\n\nSo, total digits accounted for by 4's and 8's: 188 + 98 = 286.\n\nWhich is less than 1356, so that seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the total number of times each digit appears in each place.\n\nWait, but I think my initial calculation is correct. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups, with 8 remaining pages.\n   - 4 and 8 each appear 48 times in the units place from the full groups.\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), both 4 and 8 appear once.\n   - **Total Units Place:** 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each group of 100 numbers contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - Total groups of 100 in 488 pages: 4 full groups, contributing 40 each.\n   - From 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total Tens Place:** 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 488 pages.\n   - **Total Hundreds Place:** 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should start by looking at how often the digits 4 and 8 appear in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can count the occurrences separately for each digit in each place and then sum them up. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So 4 appears once and 8 appears once. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so I need to see how many complete sets of ten there are and if there's a partial set at the end.\n\nTotal pages are 488, so how many complete tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten and then a partial set from 481 to 488. So, in each complete set of ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So for 48 complete sets, that's 48 times 1 for 4's, so 48, and same for 8's, 48.\n\nNow, the partial set from 481 to 488. Let me list those page numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So the units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So in this partial set, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So total units place counts: 48 (complete sets) + 1 (partial) = 49 for 4's, and 48 +1 =49 for 8's. Hmm, so same so far.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Each complete set of ten has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So 48 complete sets give 48 each. Then in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So units place: 48+1=49 for 4's, and 48+1=49 for 8's. So in units place, both digits appear 49 times each.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears ten times in each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (11-19), 2 (21-29), etc., up to 9 (91-99). So each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nBut wait, our book goes up to 488, so we have four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Let me check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nStarting with the first hundred, 1-100: the tens digit for 4 is in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 is in 80-89, which is 10 times. So in the first hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSame for the next three hundreds: 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these hundreds will have 40-49 and 80-89 in their respective ranges, so each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So for four hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's.\n\nBut wait, the last hundred is 301-400, right? Wait, no, 301-400 is the fourth hundred, but the last set is 401-488. Wait, 401-488 is part of the 400s, so let me check if the tens digit in 401-488 includes another set of 40-49 and 80-89.\n\nWait, 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 would only go up to 488. So in 401-488, the tens digits for 40-49 would be 40-49, which is 10 times, but wait, 401-410 is the first set, then 411-420, etc., up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last partial set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So in the tens place for 401-488, the digit 4 appears in 401-410 (10 times), 411-420 (another 10), 421-430 (another 10), 431-440 (another 10), 441-450 (another 10), 451-460 (another 10), 461-470 (another 10), 471-480 (another 10), and then 481-488 (8 times). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, each hundred is 100 pages, so 401-488 is 88 pages, so the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but not all the way to 90.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. For the tens place in 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? It appears in 401-410 (10 times), 411-420 (another 10), up to 471-480 (another 10). That's 8 sets, each contributing 10 times, so 8*10=80 times? Wait, no, because 401-488 is only 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (401-410 is the first ten, up to 481-490, but we stop at 488). Wait, actually, 401-488 includes 8 full tens (401-410, 411-420, ..., 471-480), which is 8 tens, each contributing 10 times for the tens digit 4. So that's 8*10=80 times for 4 in the tens place in 401-488. But wait, that can't be right because 401-488 is only 88 pages, so 8 full tens would be 80 pages, and then 8 more pages (481-488). So in those 8 extra pages, the tens digit is 8, so 8 appears 8 times in the tens place. Wait, no, the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, so in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times here. So in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears 8 times (from 481-488?), wait no, that's the units digit. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this systematically. For each hundred, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFirst, 1-100: tens digits 4 (40-49) and 8 (80-89), each appearing 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 101-200: same, 40-49 and 80-89, each 10 times.\n\n201-300: same, 40-49 and 80-89, each 10 times.\n\n301-400: same, 40-49 and 80-89, each 10 times.\n\nNow, 401-488: in this range, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. So in the tens place, 4 appears in 401-410 (tens digit 0?), no, wait, 401-410: the tens digit is 0 (since 401 is 4 0 1), so 401-410: tens digit is 0, so 4 doesn't appear in the tens place here. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's correct that. The tens digit is the second digit from the right. So for 401, the digits are 4, 0, 1. So the tens digit is 0. Similarly, 410 is 4,1,0, so tens digit is 1. So in 401-410, the tens digits go from 0 to 1, right? Wait, no, 401-410: the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, and 1 for 410. Wait, no, 401 is 4 0 1, so tens digit is 0, and 410 is 4 1 0, so tens digit is 1. So in 401-410, the tens digit cycles through 0 and 1. So in this range, the tens digit 4 doesn't appear at all. Similarly, in 411-420, the tens digit is 1, so 4 doesn't appear there either. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in the 401-488 range, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit can be from 0 to 8. So the tens digit 4 would appear in 440-449, right? Because in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? From 440 to 449, that's 10 times, but wait, 449 is within 488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 would appear in 480-489, but since we stop at 488, that's 9 times? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 times. So in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So in the tens place, for 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo now, adding up all the tens places:\n\nFor 1-100: 10 for 4, 10 for 8.\n\n101-200: 10 for 4, 10 for 8.\n\n201-300: 10 for 4, 10 for 8.\n\n301-400: 10 for 4, 10 for 8.\n\n401-488: 10 for 4, 9 for 8.\n\nSo total in tens place: 4*10 (from first four hundreds) +10 = 50 for 4's, and 4*10 +9=49 for 8's.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right because in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so adding to the previous 4*10=40, that's 50 for 4's. For 8's, in the first four hundreds, 4*10=40, plus 9 in 401-488, so 49 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Each hundred before 401-400 contributes 10 for 4 and 10 for 8 in the tens place. So 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400: that's four hundreds, each contributing 10 for 4 and 10 for 8. So 4*10=40 for 4's, 4*10=40 for 8's.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So total in tens place: 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+9=49 for 8's.\n\nSo in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the first digit. So in 1-99, there's no hundreds digit, so 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. 300-399: 3. 400-488:4.\n\nSo how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8? Does 8 ever appear in the hundreds place? The book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4. So 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50+89= 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49+0=98.\n\nSo the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nStarting with units place: Each complete set of ten has one 4 and one 8. 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1 to both 4 and 8. Then the partial set from 481-488: units digits are 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So units:48+1=49 for both.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens digit. So four hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 each. Then in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times in 440-449, and 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. So 40+10=50 for 4's, 40+9=49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again in 401-488. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So when does the tens digit equal 4? It's in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, when does the tens digit equal 8? It's in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So that seems right.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo yes, the total counts are correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times 1, which is 48. But wait, I should check the last partial set. From 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear there. So, the total for units place is 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Well, from 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. Let me calculate how many hundreds we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of these four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, adding that, the total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 1-100, 40-49 is 10 numbers. Then 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 440-449 which is another 10, so total 50. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers where the hundreds place is 4. So, from 400-499, the hundreds digit is 4, but since our book ends at 488, it's from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nWait, but I'm counting how many times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place, which is once for each number from 400-488. So, that's 89 times.\n\nSo, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many full sets of ten are there? 48 full sets (since 48*10=480), and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, the number of 8's in the units place is 48. Now, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Wait, no, 480-488 is actually 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, how many full tens places with 8 are there? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Every hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. That's 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no, let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0, so total 98. Hmm.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated 4's, I got 187, and 8's as 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting 8's.\n\nWait, for units place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each ten numbers, once, so 48 full tens, so 48, plus in the last partial ten (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's take specific examples:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, 4's: 187, 8's: 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Then, tens place: 50 times, units place: 48 times. So, 89 + 50 + 48 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: For each digit place, count the number of 4's and 8's separately, then sum them up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small table to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, for units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1 more. Wait, no, actually, the formula is a bit different. Wait, maybe I should think of it as for each digit position, the number of times a digit d appears is calculated as follows.\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the count of digit d is:\n\nhigher = number formed by digits higher than current\ncurrent = current digit\nlower = number formed by digits lower than current\n\ncount = higher * 10^n\nif current > d: count += 10^n\nif current == d: count += lower + 1\n\nWait, maybe that's a more systematic way.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to proceed as I did before, but let me try applying this formula to verify.\n\nLet's take the units place first.\n\nFor digit 4 in units place:\n\nn = 1 (units place)\nhigher = floor(488 / 10) = 48\ncurrent = 488 % 10 = 8\nlower = 0\n\nSo, count = higher * 10^0 = 48 * 1 = 48\nSince current (8) > 4, we add 10^0 = 1\nSo, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, this suggests 49. Did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait, let's see. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, once. So, 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing one 4 in units place, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear. So, total units place 4's: 48. But according to the formula, it's 48 +1=49. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for 0-488, so including 0. But page numbers start at 1, so maybe that's the issue.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. The formula counts the number of times digit d appears from 0 to N. But since our page numbers start at 1, maybe I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for 1 to 488.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nFor units place, digit 4:\n\nhigher = floor(488 / 10) = 48\ncurrent = 488 % 10 = 8\nlower = 0\n\ncount = higher * 1 = 48\nif current > 4, add 1\nSo, count = 48 +1 =49\n\nBut in reality, from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears 48 times because the last number is 488, which doesn't include 489 or beyond. So, why does the formula give 49? Because it's counting from 0 to 488, which includes 0, where the units digit is 0. So, from 0 to 488, the units digit 4 appears 49 times, but from 1 to 488, it's 48 times because 0 is excluded.\n\nSo, perhaps I should adjust the formula to account for the starting point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think manually. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each 10, 4 appears once in units place. There are 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so no 4. So, total 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\nhigher = floor(488 /10)=48\ncurrent=8\nlower=0\n\ncount=48*1=48\nsince current=8 >=8, add lower +1=0+1=1\nso total units 8's=48+1=49\n\nWhich matches our earlier count.\n\nSo, the formula works for 8's because when current digit is equal to d, we add lower +1. For 4's, since current digit is 8 which is greater than 4, we add 1, but since we're starting from 1, maybe that's where the confusion is.\n\nBut in reality, from 1 to 488, units digit 4 appears 48 times, and units digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier when I used the formula for 4's, it gave 49, but actual count is 48. So, perhaps the formula is for 0 to N, so I need to subtract the count for 0 if necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just stick to my initial manual count, which seems more accurate for this problem.\n\nSo, going back, I think I'll proceed with the initial counts: 4's have 48 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds, totaling 187. 8's have 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98. So, difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, since the book ends at 488, there's no hundreds digit of 8, so 0.\n\nSo, yes, 8's total is 98, 4's total is 187, difference is 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Earlier, I thought it was 50. Let me recount.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nWait, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nSo, yes, 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, we have:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nTotaling 49.\n\nSo, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nSo, units:48 (4's) vs 49 (8's)\n\nTens:50 (4's) vs 49 (8's)\n\nHundreds:89 (4's) vs 0 (8's)\n\nSo, totals:\n\n4's:48+50+89=187\n\n8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:187-98=89\n\nSo, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly?\n\nWait, another way: Let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\n4's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10=8 >=4, add 1: 48+1=49? Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48 because we start from 1. Hmm, confusion arises.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula correctly.\n\nThe formula for the number of times digit d appears in the units place from 0 to N is:\n\ncount = (N + 1) // 10 * 1\n\nplus if the last digit is >=d, add 1.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, it's:\n\nhigher = N // 10\n\ncurrent = N % 10\n\ncount = higher * 1\n\nif current > d: count +=1\n\nif current ==d: count +=1\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to refer to a standard digit counting method.\n\nThe standard method is as follows:\n\nTo count the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N:\n\n- higher = N // 10\n- current = N % 10\n- if current > d: count = higher + 1\n- elif current == d: count = higher + 1\n- else: count = higher\n\nBut wait, that's not quite right. Let me think.\n\nActually, the correct formula is:\n\nFor units digit:\n\ncount = higher * 1\n\nif current >= d, add 1\n\nBut if d is 0, it's a bit different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up the standard digit counting formula.\n\nThe standard approach is:\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times digit d appears as follows:\n\n1. Split the number into higher, current, and lower parts.\n\nFor example, for the number 488 and digit position units (position 0):\n\nhigher = 488 // 10 = 48\n\ncurrent = (488 // 1) % 10 = 8\n\nlower = 0\n\nThen, the count is:\n\ncount = higher * 10^0\n\nif current > d: count += 10^0\n\nif current == d: count += lower + 1\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\ncount = 48 * 1 + (8 >4 ? 1 : 0) + (8 ==4 ? (0 +1) : 0)\n\nWhich is 48 +1 +0=49\n\nBut since we're counting from 1 to 488, we need to subtract the count for 0, which is 1 if d=0, but for d=4, 0 doesn't have a 4 in units place. So, from 1 to 488, units digit 4 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Now I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me list the numbers where units digit is 4 from 1 to 488:\n\n4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers is that?\n\nThe first is 4, last is 484.\n\nThe sequence is 4 + 10k, where k=0 to n.\n\n484 =4 +10k => 10k=480 =>k=48.\n\nSo, k=0 to 48, which is 49 numbers.\n\nSo, units digit 4 appears 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 appears from 8,18,28,...,488.\n\n488=8 +10k =>10k=480 =>k=48\n\nSo, numbers are 8,18,...,488, which is k=0 to 48, 49 numbers.\n\nSo, units digit 4:49, units digit 8:49.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier count where I thought units digit 4 was 48. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake earlier when I said that from 1-480, there are 48 numbers with units digit 4, and then 481-488 doesn't add any. But in reality, 484 is included in 1-488, so it's 49 numbers.\n\nSo, the correct count for units digit 4 is 49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 is 49.\n\nWait, so that changes things.\n\nSo, now, let's recalculate.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens: Let's recalculate.\n\nFor tens digit 4:\n\nNumbers where tens digit is 4 are 40-49,140-149,...,440-449.\n\nEach block of 100 has one block where tens digit is 4, contributing 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many such blocks?\n\n40-49:10\n\n140-149:10\n\n240-249:10\n\n340-349:10\n\n440-449:10\n\nThat's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nAdditionally, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, does the tens digit 4 appear beyond 449? No, because 440-449 is within 401-488. So, total tens digit 4's:50.\n\nHundreds digit 4: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188.\n\nWait, let me recount.\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens: Let's recalculate.\n\nTens digit 8 appears in:\n\n80-89:10\n\n180-189:10\n\n280-289:10\n\n380-389:10\n\n480-488:9\n\nTotal:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds digit 8:0, as before.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so now I'm getting 90. But earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188.\n\nWait, where did I go wrong before? I think I miscounted the units digit for 4's earlier, thinking it was 48, but it's actually 49.\n\nSo, the correct total for 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, let me verify units digit 4 again.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the numbers ending with 4 are 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms?\n\nThe nth term is 4 +10(n-1). The last term is 484.\n\nSo, 4 +10(n-1)=484 =>10(n-1)=480 =>n-1=48 =>n=49.\n\nSo, 49 numbers. So, units digit 4 appears 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8:8,18,...,488.\n\n488=8+10(n-1)=>10(n-1)=480=>n=49.\n\nSo, 49 numbers.\n\nSo, units digit 4:49, units digit 8:49.\n\nTens digit 4:50.\n\nTens digit 8:49.\n\nHundreds digit 4:89.\n\nHundreds digit 8:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Units place:4's=49,8's=49\n\n- Tens place:4's=50,8's=49\n\n- Hundreds place:4's=89,8's=0\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct now.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by considering each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately. \n\n- **Units place**: The digit 4 appears 49 times.\n- **Tens place**: The digit 4 appears 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place**: The digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nTotal number of 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8:\n\n- **Units place**: The digit 8 appears 49 times.\n- **Tens place**: The digit 8 appears 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place**: The digit 8 does not appear.\n\nTotal number of 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. Every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, the last partial set is from 481 to 488, which includes 484, so that's another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, counting how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488? Let's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 times, so that's 4*10=40 times. Then, we have the last partial block from 401-488. In the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 times. So total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place**: Counting how many times 8 appears in the units place. Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. That's 48 times. The last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, counting 8's in the tens place. In each block of 100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place per 100 numbers. How many complete blocks are there? 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, etc.), each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40 times. The last partial block is 401-488. In the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481,...488). Wait, but actually, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: Now, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place here. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188 and the total number of 8's is 98. To find how many more 4's there are, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor the 4's:\n- Units: 48 full tens, plus 484, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 440-449, which is 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n- Units: 48 full tens, plus 488, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 480-488, which is 9, so 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, so 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, it's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of the first four blocks is 10, so 40, and the last block is 10, so 50 total. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the 4's hundreds place, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Let me confirm: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. In 488 pages, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 times, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. With 4 full hundreds, that's 40 times, plus 10 times in 440-449, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. With 48 full sets, that's 48 times, plus one in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. With 4 full hundreds, that's 40 times, plus 9 times in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place up to 488, contributing 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that when dealing with digit counting problems, it's helpful to break them down by the number of digits. So, maybe I should calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. Similarly, from 11 to 20, the same happens, and so on. So, for the units digit, the number of times a specific digit appears can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then taking the integer part, and then adding any extra occurrences if the total pages go beyond a multiple of 10.\n\nWait, let me think again. Actually, for each position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit appears can be determined by looking at how many complete groups of 10, 100, etc., there are in the total number of pages.\n\nSo, starting with the units place for digit 4: \n\nThe total number of pages is 488. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times. But wait, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, right? So, 48 groups would give 48 fours. But then, there's an extra 8 pages beyond 480, which is 481 to 488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (at 484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place 8's: \n\nSame approach. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, both 4's and 8's appear 49 times in the units place. But I think I made a mistake here because 488 is included, so let me check again. From 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 groups of 10, so 48 fours and 48 eights in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers, so units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, same count so far.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, the approach is similar but with groups of 100. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for the tens place, the number of times a digit appears is determined by how many complete hundreds there are, and then any remaining tens.\n\nSo, for the tens place, let's calculate for 4's first. \n\nTotal pages: 488. So, how many complete hundreds? 4 (since 400 is less than 488). Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. But wait, the last hundred is 400-488, which is only 88 pages. So, the tens digit in this last hundred goes from 0-8, so the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 400-409, which is 10 times, but since the book only goes up to 488, does that affect it? Wait, no, because 400-409 is within 488, so it's fully included. So, actually, the number of complete hundreds is 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500). Wait, no, 401-500 is beyond 488, so actually, up to 400-488, which is the fourth hundred. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.\n\nThe number of times a digit appears in the tens place is calculated as follows: For each digit d, the number of times it appears in the tens place is (number of complete hundreds) * 10 + (if the current hundred's tens digit is >= d, then the remaining pages beyond the last complete hundred contribute 10 if d < current tens digit, or the actual number if d is equal to the current tens digit).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate for each digit in the tens place how many times it appears.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place:\n\n- From 1-99: The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times.\n- From 100-199: Similarly, 140-149, another 10 times.\n- From 200-299: 240-249, another 10 times.\n- From 300-399: 340-349, another 10 times.\n- From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 times (since 449 is less than 488).\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- From 1-99: 80-89, 10 times.\n- From 100-199: 180-189, 10 times.\n- From 200-299: 280-289, 10 times.\n- From 300-399: 380-389, 10 times.\n- From 400-488: 480-488. Here, the tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, so tens place 4's:50, 8's:49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nFor the hundreds digit, each digit appears 100 times for each block of 100. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488).\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the hundreds place:\n\nIt appears from 400-488. How many times? Well, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nFor digit 8 in the hundreds place:\n\nLooking at the hundreds digit, the hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me go back.\n\nWhen calculating the tens place for 8's, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 occurrences. So, adding up: 10 (1-99) +10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488) = 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)= 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. For 4's, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence?\n\nThe first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10.\n\nNumber of terms: ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place:8,18,28,...,488. Last term is 488, which is 48*10 +8=488. So, number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: As calculated, 50 times.\n\nTens place for 8's:49 times.\n\nHundreds place for 4's:89 times, 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on.\n\n   To find how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full blocks of 10 and a remainder of 8.

So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from x40 to x49, where x is the hundreds digit. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n\n   Now, let's calculate how many hundreds are there up to 488. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\n   In each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds give 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\n   Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 only once in this range, which is from 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more times. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n   Wait, no, that can't be right because 401-488 is only 88 numbers, so the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but the 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is within 401-488. So, that's another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 4 * 10 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nNow, moving on to counting the number of 8's.\n\nAgain, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, for 488 pages, there are 48 full blocks of 10 (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n\n   So, in each full block, 1 time, so 48 times. In the last partial block, units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like x80 to x89. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers.\n\n   Now, how many full hundreds are there? Up to 488, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\n   In each full hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. So, 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\n   Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times, but wait, actually, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we only have up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, right? Wait, 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears in the tens place 9 times here.\n\n   So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 times. So, 4 full hundreds give 40, plus 9, total 49. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units place, so 98 total 8's.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 4's are 188, 8's are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, which includes 484, so 1 more. So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place. 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, total 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, last partial block 481-488 includes 488, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in tens place. 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9. So, total 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 480 is included, and 488 is included. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, yes, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check another approach. Maybe using a formula or another counting method.\n\nAnother way to count digit occurrences is to consider each digit place separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in that place.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor((n + 1) / 10) if d is not zero, else floor(n / 10). But since we're considering 1 to 488, and digits 4 and 8, which are non-zero, it's floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. So, 48 times for each digit in the units place, but wait, 488 is included, so maybe it's 49? Wait, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, and then the last partial cycle has 8 numbers (481-488). In that partial cycle, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, for units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier count where units place for 4 was 49 and for 8 was 49. But earlier, when I did the tens place, I found 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's, and hundreds place 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188, and 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but in the units place, both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences. So, that's correct.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nSo, for 4 in the tens place:\n\nIn each full hundred, 10 times. So, 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more. Total 50.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place:\n\nIn each full hundred, 10 times. So, 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 more. Total 49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nFor 4 in the hundreds place, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor 8 in the hundreds place, since 488 is less than 800, it's 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference. That makes sense. Let me start by thinking about how digits are counted in numbers. I remember that for problems like this, it's helpful to break it down by each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Now, since the book has 488 pages, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and then 8 more numbers. So in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, plus one more time in the 484th page (since 484 ends with a 4). Wait, no, 48*10 is 480, so from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 would be the 4th page in that last partial group. So that's one more 4 in the units place, making it 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check that again. Let me think: from 1 to 480, that's 48 groups of 10, so 48 fours in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in numbers from 40 to 49, then again from 140 to 149, and so on. Each time, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So how many such groups are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, the first group is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's five groups of 10, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The first group is 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 groups, each giving 10 fours in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50. That seems right.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place again. The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then in the last partial group from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 ends with an 8, so that's one more. So units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers from 80 to 89, 180 to 189, 280 to 289, 380 to 389, and 480 to 489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480 to 488 is part of that. Each of these groups (except maybe the last one) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo first, 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So in the tens place, each of the first four groups (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights, and the last group contributes 9 eights because it stops at 488.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 4 groups * 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 80-89 is one group, 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's five groups. But the first four are complete, each with 10 eights, and the last one has 9. So 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So total 4's:188, total 8's:98. So 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete groups of 10 (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then 481-488: 484 has a 4 in units, so +1. Total units:49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each group has 10 numbers, so 5 groups *10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units place:48 complete groups (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then 481-488: 488 has an 8 in units, so +1. Total units:49.\n\n- Tens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. In the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So 480-488: 480,481,...,488. The tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place, so 89.\n\nWait, but let me confirm 400-488 inclusive is 89 numbers. 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. Correct.\n\nAnd for the 4's in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place, so that's correct.\n\nI think my counts are accurate. So 188 fours and 98 eights. So 188 - 98 = 90. So the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once.  \n   - From 1 to 480: 48 groups of 10, so 48 occurrences.  \n   - From 481 to 488: 484 has a 4, so +1.  \n   - Total in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each group has 10 numbers, totaling 5 groups.  \n   - Total in tens place: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.  \n   - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once.  \n   - From 1 to 480: 48 groups of 10, so 48 occurrences.  \n   - From 481 to 488: 488 has an 8, so +1.  \n   - Total in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - First four groups: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - 480-488: 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place.  \n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).  \n   - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first step is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's 4; from 11-20, it's 14, and so on. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last set is from 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the units digit 4 appears in 484, which is within the range. So actually, I think the count for the units place is 48 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in every set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears ten times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. So, how many complete sets of 100 are there in 488? That's 4 full sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each set contributes ten 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 x 10 = 40 fours. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is ten numbers, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, which is ten times, so that's another 10 fours. So total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours.\n\nWait, no, actually, each full hundred contributes ten 4's in the tens place. So from 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, each has ten 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 x 10 = 40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is ten numbers, so that's another 10, making it 50 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 of these numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, that can't be right because 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, but let me check if I did that correctly.\n\nWait, 48 in units, 50 in tens, and 89 in hundreds. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is indeed 187. So total 4's are 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: In every set of ten, the digit 8 appears once. So from 1-10, it's 8; 11-20, 18; etc. So, how many complete sets of ten are in 488? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. That's 48 eights. But wait, the last set is 481-490, but since we go only up to 488, the units digit 8 appears in 488, which is within the range. So units place gives 48 eights.\n\nTens place: In every set of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears ten times in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So how many full sets of 100 are in 488? Four full sets: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes ten 8's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40 eights. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is nine numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit 8 appears in nine numbers here. So that's nine more eights in the tens place. So total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, is that correct? From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 starting at 480, so 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's nine numbers: 480,481,...,488. So nine eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 48, tens:49, so 48+49=97.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So 187 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) equals 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:48+50=98+89=187\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:48\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:48+49=97\n\nDifference:187-97=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (one per each of the 48 sets of ten).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (ten in each of the four hundreds, plus ten in 400-409).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (forty in the four hundreds, plus nine in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference between these two counts.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's handle the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nBut wait, since 488 isn't a multiple of 10, I need to handle the last partial set separately. Let me formalize this:\n\nFor the units place:\n- The number of complete sets of 10 in 488 pages is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets).\n- Each complete set contributes 1 occurrence of the digit 4 and 1 occurrence of the digit 8 in the units place.\n- So, for the units place, the count of 4's is 48 and 8's is also 48.\n- Now, the remaining pages are 488 - (48 \u00d7 10) = 8 pages. These are pages 481 to 488.\n- In these 8 pages, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (page 488).\n- Therefore, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWait, that seems like both digits appear the same number of times in the units place. Hmm, maybe I should check that again. Let me see: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, each digit appears once in the units place. So, 48 complete sets give 48 each. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once more. So yes, 49 each for units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, ..., 9 for 90-99. Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nBut let's calculate this properly. The total number of hundreds in 488 is 4 (since 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88). So, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nSo, for 4 complete hundreds, the count for 4's in tens place is 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and similarly for 8's, it's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the partial hundred is from 401 to 488. Let's see the tens digits here. The tens digit in 401-488 goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). Wait, actually, 401-488: the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, the tens digit is 8 only in 481-488, which is 8 numbers (481-488). Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 8 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages (441-450). So, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of those 8 numbers, right? So, 8 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, total for the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 4\u00d710 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\n- 8's: 4\u00d710 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40 for 4's and 40 for 8's. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits are as above. So, 441-450: 10 pages, so 4 in tens place 10 times. 481-488: 8 pages, so 8 in tens place 8 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's: 40 +8=48.\n\nOkay, that seems right.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check each step because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 in the units place. So, 48 each.\n- Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds \u00d710=40 each for 4 and 8.\n- Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For 4 in the tens place, it's from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- For 8 in the tens place, it's from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 occurrences.\n- So, total tens place: 4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+8=48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I should recount the units place or the tens place.\n\nWait, another way to count units digits: for each digit, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor((N + 1) /10). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to N is (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0). Wait, let me test that formula.\n\nFor example, up to 488, the number of 4's in units place would be (488 //10) =48, and since 488%10=8 >=4, we add 1, so 49. Similarly for 8's: (488//10)=48, and 488%10=8 >=8, so add 1, total 49. That matches our earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to N can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. The number of complete hundreds is (N // 100). Then, for the remaining part, from (N//100)*100 +1 to N, we check how many times the digit appears in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 488:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds =488//100=4\nRemaining pages:488 -4*100=88\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n- For each complete hundred, each digit appears 10 times, so 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8.\n- Now, for the remaining 88 pages (1-88), how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-88, the tens digits go from 0 (1-9) to 8 (80-88). So, digit 4 appears in the tens place from 40-49, which is 10 numbers (40-49). So, 10 times.\nDigit 8 appears in the tens place from 80-88, which is 9 numbers (80-88). Wait, but in our case, the remaining pages are 1-88, but since we're considering the tens place, from 1-88, the tens digits go from 0 (1-9) to 8 (80-88). So, digit 8 in tens place appears 9 times (80-88).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place (481-488). Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the partial hundreds. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, when calculating the tens place for the entire 1-488, the complete hundreds are 4, each contributing 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, so 40 each for 4 and 8. Then, the remaining 88 pages (1-88) would have:\n\n- For digit 4 in tens place: from 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- For digit 8 in tens place: from 80-88, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was calculating for 401-488, I had 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. But now, using this method, it's 9 occurrences in the remaining 88 pages. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine. When I was looking at 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, in this range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. The tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 occurrences. So, in this partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nBut when I calculated using the formula, I considered the remaining 88 pages as 1-88, which would have 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. But that's not correct because 401-488 is a separate range, not 1-88. So, perhaps I should adjust my approach.\n\nWait, maybe the formula I used earlier is for the entire 1-488, not just the partial hundreds. So, let me try again.\n\nFor the tens place, the total number of times a digit d appears is:\n\n- Number of complete hundreds: 488 // 100 =4\n- Each complete hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40 for 4 and 8.\n\n- Now, the remaining pages are 488 -4\u00d7100=88 pages, which are 401-488.\n\nIn these 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, for each tens digit, we can count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\n- Tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- Tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n- 4's:40+10=50\n- 8's:40+8=48\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. So, that seems correct.\n\nEarlier, when I thought of using the formula for the remaining 88 pages as 1-88, that was incorrect because it's actually 401-488, so the tens digits start from 0 again. So, the correct counts are 10 for 4 and 8 for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, I think my initial calculation was correct: 50 times for 4's and 48 times for 8's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding them up, as before, gives 188 4's and 97 8's, so the difference is 91.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just check if there's any other way to approach this problem, maybe using a different counting method or formula to confirm.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position separately.\n\nFor units place:\n- As before, 488//10=48, and since 488%10 >=4 and >=8, we add 1 to each, so 49 each.\n\nFor tens place:\n- 488//100=4, so 4\u00d710=40 each.\n- Then, 488%100=88, so in the tens place, the digit 4 appears floor((88 +1)/10) =9 times? Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, perhaps another formula: for the tens place, the number of times a digit d appears is:\n\n- (N // 100) \u00d710 + extra.\n\nWhere extra is:\n- If the current digit (tens) is less than d, add 0.\n- If equal, add (current digit +1).\n- If greater, add 10.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of each digit position separately.\n\nAlternatively, for the tens place:\n\nThe number of times 4 appears in the tens place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\n- For each hundred, 10 times.\n- Then, for the remaining part, if the tens digit is greater than 4, add (tens digit -4) \u00d710\n- If equal, add (remaining numbers in that tens group +1)\n- If less, add 0.\n\nWait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, for the tens place, the number of times 4 appears is:\n\n- Number of complete hundreds \u00d710\n- Plus, if the tens digit in the remaining part is greater than 4, add 10\n- If equal, add (remaining numbers - (4\u00d710 +1))\n- If less, add 0\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me stick with my initial method, which gave me 50 for 4's and 48 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place, it's straightforward: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding them up, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - Remaining pages: 8 (481-488).\n   - 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place of the remaining pages.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4, contributing 40 each.\n   - Remaining pages (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n**Answer**: The digit 4 is printed 91 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering the positions where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each digit separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, the units place. In every block of 10 numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the last partial block, 481-488, does the units digit ever reach 4? Let me check: 484 is within that range, so that's one more 4. So total for units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10, and so on. \n\nLet me figure out how many hundreds are in 488. That's 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, what about the last partial hundred, 401-488? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449. Let me count: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So total for tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. Hmm, but wait, is that right? Wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So yes, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Again, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? As before, 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial block is 481-488. Does the units digit reach 8 in that range? Yes, 488 is included, so that's one more 8. So total units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, from 1-100, 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 8's. Similarly, 101-200 has 180-189, another 10, and so on up to 401-500. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 401-488. \n\nSo, how many full hundreds? 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the last partial hundred, 401-488. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's 9 8's in the tens place. So total for tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So yes, 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Did I count correctly?\n\nFor units place: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last partial block (481-488) has 488, so that's one more, totaling 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each with 10 8's, so 40, plus in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 4's in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 blocks give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 488 is included, so one more. So 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's consider the total number of digits. For a 488-page book, the total number of digits can be calculated, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nWait, another way to think about the hundreds place for 4's: Since 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, that's correct.\n\nFor the tens place in 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So 5 sets of 10, but wait, 40-49 is in 1-100, 140-149 in 101-200, 240-249 in 201-300, 340-349 in 301-400, and 440-449 in 401-488. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 sets, but actually, it's 5 sets. Wait, no, because 440-449 is in the 401-500 range, but since our book ends at 488, 440-449 is included. So, wait, how many hundreds are there? 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. But our book only goes up to 488, so the last partial hundred is 401-488. So in each of the first four hundreds, we have 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40, plus in 401-488, we have 440-449, which is another 10. So total 50. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So each of the first four hundreds contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40, plus in 401-488, 480-488 contributes 9 8's. So total 49.\n\nWait, but in the first four hundreds, each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40, and then the last partial hundred contributes 9, so 40+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4. With 48 full blocks and one in the last partial block (484), total is 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 fours. Four full hundreds contribute 40, plus 10 in 440-449, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** Each block of 10 contributes one 8. With 48 full blocks and one in the last partial block (488), total is 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 eights. Four full hundreds contribute 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears, then find the difference between those two counts.\n\nLet me start by considering the positions where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I think I should analyze each digit position separately for both 4 and 8. Maybe I can use a systematic approach, like counting the number of 4's and 8's in the units place, then in the tens place, and finally in the hundreds place, and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and similarly, the digit 8 appears once. For example, from 1 to 10, 4 appears once (page 4), and 8 appears once (page 8). So, if I can figure out how many complete sets of ten there are in 488 pages, I can multiply that by 1 to get the number of 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10, so there will be some extra pages beyond the last complete set of ten. So, I should calculate the number of complete sets and then check the remaining pages. The total number of pages is 488, so the number of complete sets of ten is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete sets and 8 extra pages. Each complete set contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 each. Now, looking at the remaining 8 pages (from 481 to 488), I need to check if any of these have a 4 or 8 in the units place. Let's see: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Here, 484 ends with a 4, so that's one more 4 in the units place. 488 ends with an 8, so that's one more 8 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal, 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, so for each hundred, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (like 80-89). Now, since the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each of the 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40 times, and same for 8: 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 again. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit, how many times does it appear? Let's see: 401-410: tens digit 0, 411-420: 1, ..., 480-488: 8. So, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Now, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It's from 440-449, which is 10 pages. Similarly, 8 appears from 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. The range is 401-488, which is 88 pages. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit, how many pages? From 401-410: 10 pages, 411-420: 10, ..., 480-488: 9 pages. So, for the tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For the tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 4*10 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Similarly, tens place 8's: 4*10 (from the four hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. Wait, but wait, in the four hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50, and 8's: 40 +9=49. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. Since the book has up to 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Now, for the hundreds digit, we're looking for when it's 4 or 8. But 8 is not a possible hundreds digit because the book only goes up to 488, which is 4 hundreds. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times. How about 8? Since the book doesn't go beyond 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so subtract 8's from 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages, 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) include 484 (units 4) and 488 (units 8), so adding 1 each, making units 4's = 49, units 8's = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 times each for 4 and 8, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens 4's = 40 +10=50, tens 8's=40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 4's = 49 +50 +89=188. 8's=49 +49 +0=98. Difference=188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 pages mean 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - 4 hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - In 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 more 4's, and 480-488 adds 9 more 8's.\n   - Total tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears as a hundreds digit.\n   - Total hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts**:\n   - 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference**:\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to find the number of times a particular digit appears, I can analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, and maybe even thousands, but in this case, since 488 is less than 1000, I probably only need to go up to the hundreds place.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every group of ten pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for the digit 8. So from page 1 to page 488, how many complete groups of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of ten, and then an extra 8 pages. So in the units place, for each digit (4 and 8), they each appear 48 times. But wait, in the extra 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so both 4 and 8 appear once more in the units place. So that would make it 48 + 1 = 49 times each for the units place. Wait, no, that might not be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digit in the last group would go up to 8. So, let me think again. For the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear?\n\nActually, for the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each group of ten. So, for each ten pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, how many tens are there in 488? It's 48 full tens (since 48*10=480) and then 8 more pages. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times (once every ten pages) plus one more time in the 481-488 range because 484 has a 4 in the units place. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times plus one more time in 488. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so in the units place of the last 8 pages (481-488), the digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears for ten consecutive pages. For example, 40-49 have 4 in the tens place, 80-89 have 8 in the tens place, etc. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, every hundred pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). Since 488 is less than 500, we have four full hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, actually, 488 is in the 400-488 range, which is 89 pages. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 0-399, that's four hundreds, so 4 appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, ..., up to 8 for 480-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, in 400-409, the tens digit is 0, so 4 doesn't appear. Wait, no, the tens digit is 0, so 4 doesn't appear in the tens place in 400-409. Wait, actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, ..., up to 8 for 480-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place only when the tens digit is 4, which would be 440-449. So, that's 10 pages: 440-449. So, in the 400-488 range, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, total for 4 in the tens place is 40 (from 0-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: in each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). So, from 0-399, that's 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit goes up to 8 (480-488). So, 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, from 480-488, that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, total for 8 in the tens place is 40 (from 0-399) + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 0-399, each hundred has 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 times. So, total 40+9=49 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is ahead by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, 4 is ahead by 89 here.\n\nNow, let's add up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place: from 1-488, how many 4's and 8's in the units digit.\n\nEach ten pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 to both 4 and 8. So, 48*1=48 for each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units: 48+1=49 for both.\n\nTens place: For 4, in each hundred, 10 times in the tens place (40-49). So, 4 hundreds (0-399) give 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, total 50.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: each hundred gives 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, totals:\n4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, but I'm now recalling that sometimes when counting the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me confirm the hundreds place again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Since 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups, plus 8 extra pages.\n   - 4 and 8 each appear 48 times in the units place from the full groups.\n   - In the extra 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - From 1-399: 4 appears 40 times (4*10), 8 appears 40 times.\n   - From 400-488:\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering the different positions where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll need to calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each of these positions separately and then add them up.\n\nFirst, let's handle the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a complete set of numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, I need to see how many full sets of 10 there are and then handle any remaining pages.\n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. That means there are 48 full sets of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. In each full set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same for 8. So, for the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 also appears 48 times. Now, for the extra 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484), and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The first set is pages 1-10, then 11-20, up to 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the last partial set is 481-488. So, in each full set of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. There are 48 full sets, so 48 times each. Then, in the partial set from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, total units place: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, they are equal in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in 1-100, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, in 101-200, the same applies, and so on.\n\nSo, the book has 488 pages, which is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Then, the last partial hundred is 401-488.\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. Since there are four full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, let's see: 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: tens digit is 1, ..., 481-488: tens digit is 8. So, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but only up to 488, so the tens digit for 480-489 would be 8, but we only go up to 488, so 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit in 401-488 cycles through 0 to 8, but each digit from 0 to 8 appears how many times?\n\nWait, let's think differently. From 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410 (10 pages), 1 for 411-420 (10 pages), ..., 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, for the tens digit in 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 10 pages (401-410)\n- Tens digit 1: 10 pages (411-420)\n- ...\n- Tens digit 7: 10 pages (471-480)\n- Tens digit 8: 8 pages (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the tens place in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, but 480-489 would be 10 pages. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. The tens digit is 8 in the range 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the pages with tens digit 8 are 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but earlier, in each full hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). Therefore, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the last partial hundred, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: digit 4 appears 4 (from full hundreds) * 10 + 10 (from last partial) = 50 times. Digit 8 appears 4 * 10 + 9 = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, four full hundreds give 4 * 10 = 40 times for each digit in the tens place. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. For 8, it's 40 + 9 = 49. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. How many times is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times. So, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about digit 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The hundreds digit cycles as follows: 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 8 in units place: 48 each.\n- Last 8 pages (481-488): units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n- Total units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each full hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in tens place: 4 full hundreds give 40 each.\n- Last partial hundred (401-488):\n  - Tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 pages.\n  - Tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n- So, 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8 in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (at 484) and one more 8 (at 488).\n   - Total: 49 times each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 times for each digit in four full hundreds.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 times for 4 and 49 times for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 times for 4 and 0 times for 8.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, it's 4; from 11 to 20, it's 14; and so on. So, I can calculate how many full sets of ten there are in 488 and then see how many 4's are in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: In every set of one hundred numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly ten times in the tens place. For example, from 40 to 49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. So, I can calculate how many full sets of one hundred there are and then adjust for any remaining numbers.\n\nFor the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I'm not double-counting any numbers. Since each digit place is considered separately, I think it's okay.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nFirst, the units place for 8: Similar to 4, in every set of ten, 8 appears once in the units place. So, I'll calculate the number of full tens in 488 and then check if there's a partial set beyond that.\n\nFor the tens place: In every set of one hundred, 8 appears ten times in the tens place, like from 80 to 89. So, again, I'll calculate how many full hundreds there are and then any remaining numbers.\n\nFor the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800 onwards, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds place never has an 8. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 800, so that's correct. So, I don't need to consider the hundreds place for 8.\n\nNow, let me start calculating the number of 4's.\n\nUnits place for 4:\nTotal numbers = 488\nNumber of complete tens = 488 // 10 = 48\nEach complete ten has one 4 in the units place, so 48 * 1 = 48\nNow, check the remainder: 488 % 10 = 8, so from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8. The next 4 would be at 484, which is within this range, so that's one more 4. So, total units place 4's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place for 4:\nNumber of complete hundreds = 488 // 100 = 4\nEach complete hundred has ten 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40\nNow, check the remainder: 488 % 100 = 88\nIn the last partial hundred, from 400 to 488, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 440 to 449. That's ten numbers, so ten 4's. So, total tens place 4's = 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place for 4:\nAs calculated earlier, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's = Units + Tens + Hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nUnits place for 8:\nTotal numbers = 488\nNumber of complete tens = 488 // 10 = 48\nEach complete ten has one 8 in the units place, so 48 * 1 = 48\nRemainder: 488 % 10 = 8, so from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8. The next 8 would be at 488, which is the last number, so that's one more 8. So, units place 8's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place for 8:\nNumber of complete hundreds = 488 // 100 = 4\nEach complete hundred has ten 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40\nRemainder: 488 % 100 = 88\nIn the last partial hundred, from 400 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480 to 488. That's nine numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's nine 8's. So, total tens place 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place for 8:\nAs discussed earlier, since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's = 0.\n\nTotal 8's = Units + Tens + Hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again. Units place: 49, Tens place:49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's.\n\nNumber of 4's = 188\nNumber of 8's = 98\nDifference = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again because 188 - 98 is 90, but I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: For every 10 numbers, one 4. From 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, so 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so the next 4 is at 484, which is within this range. So, 48 +1=49 units place 4's.\n\nTens place: For every 100 numbers, ten 4's in the tens place. So, from 1-100: 40-49, ten 4's. Similarly, 101-200: 140-149, etc. So, for 400-488, that's another ten 4's in the tens place (440-449). So, total tens place 4's: 4 hundreds (1-400) each contributing ten 4's, so 4*10=40, plus the last partial hundred (400-488) contributing ten more, so 40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 +89= 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: Similarly, every 10 numbers, one 8. From 1-480, 48 sets, so 48. Then 481-488 includes 488, which is an 8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: Every 100 numbers, ten 8's in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's four sets of 100, each contributing ten 8's, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488. That's nine numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, nine 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: No 8's, as before.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I feel like I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, 80-89 is ten numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, in 1-400, there are four such hundreds, each contributing ten 8's, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488. That's nine numbers because 488 is the end. So, 480,481,...,488: that's nine numbers, so nine 8's in the tens place. So, 40+9=49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is actually nine numbers, right? 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's nine numbers, so nine 8's in the tens place. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total 8's are 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 4's, from 400-488, I included 440-449 as ten 4's. That's correct because 440-449 is ten numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. So, that's ten 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 400-488, 480-488 is nine numbers, so nine 8's.\n\nWait, but when counting 8's in the tens place, is 480 included? Yes, because 480 is part of the 400-488 range, and its tens digit is 8. So, yes, nine numbers.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90. So, 90 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have miscounted. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is ten numbers, so ten 4's. That's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the difference is indeed 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 occurrence of 4.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488: 48.\n   - Remainder (481-488): 484 contributes 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences of 4.\n   - Total complete sets of 100 in 488: 4.\n   - Contribution: 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Last partial set (400-488): 440-449 contributes 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 occurrence of 8.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488: 48.\n   - Remainder (481-488): 488 contributes 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences of 8.\n   - Total complete sets of 100 in 488: 4.\n   - Contribution: 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Last partial set (400-488): 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** 90 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first thing to do is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each complete set of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nSo, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages. \n\nIn each complete set, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that would be 48 times each. So, 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place. \n\nBut wait, in the last partial set (pages 481-488), how does that affect the count? Let's see: the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at page 484. And 8 appears at page 488. So that's one more 4 and one more 8. \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so units place contributes equally to both counts.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for pages 80-89, also 10 times.\n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 ten times and 8 ten times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 4's and 4*10 = 40 8's.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's check when the tens digit is 4 and 8.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's 10 4's. The tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), but wait, 480 is included, so that's 9 pages? Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9? Wait, no, 488 - 480 is 8, so adding 1 gives 9 pages. But actually, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: pages 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So, in the partial hundred, we have 10 4's and 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50. Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, so far, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49. That's a difference of +1 for 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. The hundreds digit is never 8 in this book because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nAdding up all the digits:\n\nTotal 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 = 90, which seems like a big difference. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check each part.\n\nUnits place: 488 pages. For units digit, each digit 0-9 appears equally except possibly the last partial set. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So units: 48*1 +1 =49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 pages) and 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 10 4's and 9 8's. So total 4's in tens: 40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 4's. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0 8's. That's correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check another way. Maybe I'm overcounting in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, another way: total number of 4's is the sum of 4's in units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nSimilarly for 8's.\n\nWait, maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nEach 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8. So, 488 /10 =48 full groups, each contributing 1 of each. So 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total 4's:48+1=49, 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach 100 pages have 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 400 pages would have 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's. Then, the last 88 pages (401-488) have tens digits as follows:\n\nFrom 401-499, the tens digits go from 0 to 9, but we only go up to 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digits are from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, when the tens digit is 4, that's 440-449, which is 10 pages. When the tens digit is 8, that's 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSo, 10 4's and 9 8's in the tens place for the last 88 pages. So total 4's in tens:40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-399, the hundreds digit is 0,1,2,3. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, 488-400+1=89 pages with hundreds digit 4. So, 89 4's. 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48 full sets, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each set of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The last 88 pages (401-488) add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 more numbers. In each complete set, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So for 48 sets, that's 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So total units place: 48 +1 = 49 fours and 48 +1 = 49 eights. Wait, so in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal. That's interesting.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each digit in the tens place, it appears 10 times in each 100-number block. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times per 100 numbers. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, it also appears 10 times per 100 numbers.\n\nNow, how many complete 100-number blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of the 4 complete blocks, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the same for 8. So that's 4 blocks * 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. The tens digit in 401-488 is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So in the tens place, digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 fours. Similarly, digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we stop at 488, that's 9 times? Wait, no, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but 480 is included, right? So from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 401-488, the tens digits go 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, not 10. So for the tens digit 8, it's 8 numbers, not 10. Wait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me think again. In the 100s, the tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So for 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, it appears 10 times except for the last one, which might be less.\n\nWait, actually, 401-488 is 88 numbers. So, 88 divided by 10 is 8 full sets, so each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and the digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). So, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 10 times (in 440-449), and digit 8 appears 8 times (in 480-488). So, adding that to the 40 fours and 40 eights from the complete blocks, the total in the tens place would be:\n\nFours: 40 + 10 = 50\n\nEights: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 fours and 48 eights.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me check: 401-488 is 88 numbers. So, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each digit from 0 to 7 appears exactly 10 times because 8*10=80, and then 8 more numbers (481-488) where the tens digit is 8. So, digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (in 440-449) and 8 appears 8 times (480-488). So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 would have hundreds digit 4. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 300-399, that's 100 numbers, so 100 fours. Then from 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89), so another 89 fours. So total fours in hundreds place: 100 + 89 = 189.\n\nHow about eights in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: pages go up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8 because 800 would be beyond 488. So, yes, eights in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let me summarize:\n\nUnits place:\n- Fours: 49\n- Eights: 49\n\nTens place:\n- Fours: 50\n- Eights: 48\n\nHundreds place:\n- Fours: 189\n- Eights: 0\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 189 = 288\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 288 - 97 = 191.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, I think I made a mistake. From 300-399, that's 100 numbers, so 100 fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours in hundreds place: 100 + 89 = 189. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, units digit fours: 49, eights: 49. Tens place fours: 50, eights: 48. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 189 = 288. Total eights: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97. So difference is 288 - 97 = 191.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So total units fours: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, units eights: same logic, 48 +1=49. So that's correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) would be 4*10=40 fours. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. In 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 fours. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but wait, earlier I thought it was 8. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8, but now I'm seeing 9. Let me check: 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 401-488. So, total tens eights: 4*10=40 (from 1-400) plus 9, so 49? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, in the 1-400 range, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIn the 1-400 range, each hundred has the tens digit 8 appearing 10 times. So 4 hundreds: 4*10=40.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights.\n\nSo total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, fours in tens place: in 1-400, 4*10=40 fours. In 401-488, 440-449 is 10 fours. So total fours: 40 +10=50.\n\nSo, that would mean in the tens place, fours:50, eights:49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought eights were 48. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 8 numbers. It's actually 9 numbers, so 9 eights.\n\nSo, correcting that:\n\nTotal fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (189) = 49+50=99+189=288.\n\nTotal eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference is 288 -98=190.\n\nWait, so earlier I had 97 eights, but now it's 98. Let me check again.\n\nWait, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nTens place: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:189 fours, 0 eights.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+189=288.\n\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, difference is 288-98=190.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier in the tens place eights count. It should be 49, not 48, because in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 8. So, total eights in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nTherefore, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 288-98=190.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. So that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 (from 1-400) +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, fours in tens place:40 (from 1-400) +10 (from 440-449)=50.\n\nSo, yes, total fours:288, eights:98, difference:190.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 300-399:100 fours. From 400-488:89 fours. So, 100+89=189 fours in hundreds place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total fours:288, eights:98. Difference:190.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 191, but now it's 190. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's recount:\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 488 pages.\n\n- Units digit cycles every 10, so 488/10=48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n\n- So, 48 fours and 48 eights.\n\n- Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8.\n\n- So, in these, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n\n- So, units fours:48+1=49.\n\n- Units eights:48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n\n- 4 hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 fours, 4*10=40 eights.\n\n- From 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449:10 fours.\n\n- The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488:9 eights.\n\n- So, total tens fours:40+10=50.\n\n- Total tens eights:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 1-99: hundreds digit 1, no 4's or 8's.\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit 2.\n\n- 200-299: hundreds digit 3.\n\n- 300-399: hundreds digit 4:100 fours.\n\n- 400-488: hundreds digit 4:89 fours.\n\n- So, total hundreds fours:100+89=189.\n\n- Hundreds eights:0.\n\nTotal fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +189 (hundreds)=288.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:288-98=190.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 190 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 191, but now it's 190. So, I think the correct answer is 190.\n\nWait, but let me check once more.\n\nWait, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, 40 (from 1-400) +9=49 eights in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, fours in tens place:40 (from 1-400) +10 (440-449)=50.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 288-98=190.\n\nSo, the answer is 190 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total units place analysis:\n     - 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, contributing 48 fours and 48 eights.\n     - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) contribute 1 four (484) and 1 eight (488).\n     - **Total:** 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Analysis:\n     - 400 pages / 100 = 4 full cycles, contributing 40 fours and 40 eights.\n     - From 401-488, the tens digit '4' appears 10 times (440-449), and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - **Total:** 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Analysis:\n     - '4' appears in 300-399 (100 times) and 400-488 (89 times), totaling 189 fours.\n     - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n     - **Total:** 189 fours, 0 eights.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **Fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 189 (hundreds) = 288\n- **Eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 288 fours - 98 eights = 190\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 190 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{190}$"
