After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, each group of 10 has one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers, the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 49 times each. So the difference here is zero. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere because I was expecting a difference.\n\nLet me check again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So for each digit position, the count should be similar, but maybe the higher digits affect it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should also consider the tens and hundreds places. Let me do that now.\n\nStarting with the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. But actually, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n\nBut wait, 488 is less than 500, so I need to adjust for that. Let me think. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So let's break it down:\n\n- For the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400 to 488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. So 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, the tens place: Let's consider each hundred separately.\n\nFrom 1-99: The tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each, but wait, actually, from 1-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. But wait, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, so for digits 1-9, they appear 10 times each in the tens place from 10-99. So for 1-99, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly for 8, it appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nFrom 100-399: Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) will have the tens digit cycling 0-9 ten times each. So in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. Since there are three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), that's 3*10=30 times for 4 and 3*10=30 times for 8.\n\nNow, from 400-488: The tens digit here can be from 0 to 8. Let's see:\n\n- Pages 400-409: tens digit is 0\n- 410-419: tens digit is 1\n- 420-429: tens digit is 2\n- 430-439: tens digit is 3\n- 440-449: tens digit is 4\n- 450-459: tens digit is 5\n- 460-469: tens digit is 6\n- 470-479: tens digit is 7\n- 480-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo for the tens digit in 400-488:\n\n- Digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n- Digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488).\n\nSo in the tens place, from 400-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nAdding it all up for the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 10 (from 1-99) + 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 times.\n- 8's: 10 (from 1-99) + 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49 times.\n\nSo in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times, making a difference of 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the hundreds place, which we already considered:\n\n- 4's: 89 times (from 400-488).\n- 8's: 0 times.\n\nSo in the hundreds place, 4's are 89 and 8's are 0, so that's a difference of 89.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the units place, both 4's and 8's were 49 each, so no difference there. In the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49, so a difference of +1 for 4's. In the hundreds place, 4's are 89 and 8's are 0, so that's a difference of +89 for 4's.\n\nSo total differences:\n\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nStarting with the units place again:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48*1=48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers are 481-488, so 484 is within that range, so that's one more 4. So total 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in the units place: same logic, 48 full groups (48*1=48) and in the remaining 8 numbers, 488 is included, so that's one more 8. So total 49. So units place difference is 0.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-99: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nFrom 100-399: each hundred has 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place, so 3 hundreds give 30 each.\n\nFrom 400-488: 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times), 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n\nSo 4's in tens place: 10 + 30 + 10 = 50.\n\n8's in tens place: 10 + 30 + 9 = 49.\n\nDifference in tens place: 50 - 49 = +1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n8's: 0 times.\n\nDifference in hundreds place: 89 - 0 = +89.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other digits. For example, in the hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. That's correct because 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is actually 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So yes, 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in 400-488.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99+89=188.\n\n8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nSo total 4's: 188, total 8's:98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total units places: 488 numbers.\n   - Number of complete groups of 10: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - 4's in units place: 48 times from complete groups + 1 from 484 \u2192 Total 49.\n   - 8's in units place: 48 times from complete groups + 1 from 488 \u2192 Total 49.\n   - Difference in units place: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n   - From 1-99: 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - From 100-399: 3 sets of 100, so 30 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - From 400-488: 440-449 (10 times for 4) and 480-488 (9 times for 8).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 10 + 30 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 10 + 30 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference in tens place: 50 - 49 = +1.\n\n3. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488: 4 appears 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference in hundreds place: 89 - 0 = +89.\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Units: 0\n   - Tens: +1\n   - Hundreds: +89\n   - Total difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a particular digit appears, I can analyze each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014and calculate how many times the digit appears in each place. So, I'll need to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place, and then sum them up. After that, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in a sequence of numbers. But since the book ends at 488, I need to check if 488 affects the count in the units place. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles normally up to 488. So, for the units place, I can calculate how many full cycles of 10 there are in 488 pages, and then see how many 4's and 8's are in each cycle.\n\nThe number of full tens in 488 is 48 because 48 * 10 = 480, and then there are 8 more pages. So, for each full ten, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9, so each digit appears once every 10 numbers. Therefore, the number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of full tens multiplied by 1 (since each digit appears once per ten) plus any additional occurrences in the remaining numbers.\n\nSo, for the units place:\n- Number of 4's: 48 full tens * 1 = 48, plus in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, there's one more 4 in 484. So total 4's in units place = 48 + 1 = 49.\n- Number of 8's: Similarly, 48 full tens * 1 = 48, plus in the remaining 8 pages, the units digit 8 appears once in 488. So total 8's in units place = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The remaining pages after 480 are 481 to 488, which are 8 pages. The units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in 488 pages, how many hundreds do we have?\n\nWell, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, the number of full hundreds is 4, and then there's an additional 88 pages beyond that. So, for the tens place:\n\n- For each full hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 full hundreds, each digit appears 4*10 = 40 times.\n\n- Now, for the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488), we need to check the tens digits. The tens digits in this range go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this range.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each tens digit, there are 10 numbers (except maybe the last one if it's cut short). But since 488 is the end, the tens digit 8 has numbers from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480 is included in the 400-499 range, right? Wait, actually, 401-488 is 88 pages, so from 401 to 488. So, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, but since we're stopping at 488, the tens digit 8 appears only 9 times (480-488, but 480 is included in the 400-499 range, so actually, from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but 480 is part of the 400-499 range, so in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 8 appears only once? Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider that in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for the last one, which may be cut short. But 88 is 8*10 + 8, so perhaps each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times, but wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let me check:\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers\n411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers\n...\n481-490: tens digit 8, 10 numbers\nBut wait, 488 is the end, so 481-488 is only 8 numbers, not 10. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the remaining pages.\n\nWait, but 488 is page 488, so from 481 to 488 is 8 numbers (481,482,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages. Wait, but that's only 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times. But earlier, in the full hundreds, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. So, for the tens place:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place:\n- From full hundreds: 4*10 = 40\n- From remaining 88 pages: The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, in the remaining 88 pages, which are 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? Because 440 is included in 401-488. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, total 8's in tens place:\n- From full hundreds: 4*10 = 40\n- From remaining 88 pages: The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480 is part of the 400-499 range, so in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, but 480 is included in 401-488? Wait, 480 is page 480, which is within 401-488. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 is page 480, and 488 is page 488, so that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages. So total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens digit 8 in the remaining 88 pages would be 8 times because from 481-488 is 8 numbers, but actually, 480 is included, so it's 9 numbers. Hmm, I think that's correct because 480 is page 480, which is within the 401-488 range. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times because from 481-488 is 8 numbers, but that's not considering 480. So, 480 is included, so it's 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nSo, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and then 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3, or 4. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would require pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nSo, the difference in the hundreds place is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\nDifference: 0\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\nDifference: 1\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\nDifference: 89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Since the book doesn't go beyond 488, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. I had 50 4's and 49 8's, so a difference of 1. Units place had equal counts, so 0 difference. Hundreds place had 89 more 4's. So total difference is 89 + 1 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was calculating the tens place, I thought the remaining 88 pages (401-488) had the tens digit 8 appearing 9 times, but I'm wondering if that's correct. Let me list them out:\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. So, pages 480,481,...,488. That's 9 pages. So, 9 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit 4, in the remaining 88 pages, it occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nUnits: 49 4's, 49 8's\nTens: 50 4's, 49 8's\nHundreds: 89 4's, 0 8's\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the total counts to make sure I didn't add wrong.\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nYes, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total full tens in 488 pages: 48 (since 48*10=480).\n   - Remaining pages: 481-488 (8 pages).\n   - **4's:** 48 times in full tens + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - **8's:** 48 times in full tens + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Full hundreds in 488 pages: 4 (400 pages).\n   - Remaining pages: 401-488 (88 pages).\n   - **4's:** 4*10=40 in full hundreds + 10 (440-449) = 50.\n   - **8's:** 4*10=40 in full hundreds + 9 (480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488.\n   - **4's:** 89 times (400-488).\n   - **8's:** 0 times (since the book ends at 488).\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's look at each position separately.\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, since the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. Each of these sets contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So actually, it's 48 full sets plus one more, making it 49 times that 4 appears in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If we have 488 pages, the units digit cycles 48 times completely (each cycle being 10 pages), and then there's 8 more pages (481-488). So in each full cycle, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial cycle, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So that's 1 more, making it 49 in total for the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens digit. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there in 488 pages?\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the ranges would be:\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since 488 is the last page, 449 is well within that, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? Let's calculate 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 occurrences of the digit 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, how many times does it appear in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: For the tens digit, the digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last range is only up to 488.\n\nSo, let's count each range:\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, no. From 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total in tens place is 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So yes, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, let me sum up the totals again to make sure.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's), which equals 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's, we have 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49 times, as calculated earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nUnits place for 4's: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many such numbers?\n\nThe last number is 484, which is 484 = 4 + 10*(n-1). Let's solve for n.\n\n484 = 4 + 10*(n-1)\n484 - 4 = 10*(n-1)\n480 = 10*(n-1)\nn-1 = 48\nn = 49\n\nSo, 49 times. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, from 8,18,...,488. The last number is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488.\n\n8 + 10*(n-1) = 488\n10*(n-1) = 480\nn-1 = 48\nn = 49\n\nSo, 49 times, correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 50 times, as we have 5 ranges each contributing 10.\n\nTens place for 8's: 49 times, as the last range is only 9 numbers.\n\nSo, yes, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 times (every 10 numbers, including 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 times (ranges 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 times (pages 400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 times (every 10 numbers, including 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 times (ranges 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 times (no page numbers reach 800).\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. \n\nLet me start by considering the different positions where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I think I should calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each of these positions separately and then add them up.\n\nFirst, let's handle the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place, except for 0, which doesn't appear in page 1. Wait, no, actually, page 1 is 1, so maybe 0 doesn't appear in the units place until page 10, which is 10. Hmm, maybe I should adjust for that.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider how many complete groups of ten there are and then account for any remaining pages. The total number of pages is 488, so there are 48 complete groups of ten (since 48*10=480) and then 8 more pages (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete group of ten, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So for each group of ten, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. So for 48 groups, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48, and the same for 8. \n\nBut then we have the remaining 8 pages: 481 to 488. In the units place, these pages will have digits from 1 to 8. So the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is included, so maybe I should check that again.\n\nWait, let me recount. The first 480 pages are 48 groups of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then pages 481 to 488: the units digits go from 1 to 8. So 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So units place total: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. So in units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 pages. For example, in pages 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly for 8 in 80-89, 10 times.\n\nBut since the book has 488 pages, let's see how many complete hundreds we have. 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) will have 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So for 4, that's 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, for 8, it's also 40 times.\n\nBut wait, the last hundred is 301-400, right? Wait, 400 is included, but the book goes up to 488, so the last hundred is 301-400, and then 401-488. Hmm, so maybe I need to adjust for the incomplete hundred after 400.\n\nWait, let me think again. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages remaining (401-488).\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in 1-100, 140-149 in 101-200, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So for each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 times for 4's and 4*10=40 times for 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages: 401-488. Let's look at the tens digit here. Pages 401-409: tens digit is 0. 410-419: tens digit is 1. 420-429: tens digit is 2. 430-439: tens digit is 3. 440-449: tens digit is 4. 450-459: tens digit is 5. 460-469: tens digit is 6. 470-479: tens digit is 7. 480-488: tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, so in the 401-488 range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So that's 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages: 480, 481, ..., 488. So the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages. So for the tens place in the remaining pages:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (440-449)\n- 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nTherefore, total in tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from first 400 pages) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from first 400 pages) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49\n\nWait, that seems correct. So in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99 (since pages are 1-488, but 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, right? Wait, no, page numbers are 1 to 488, so 1-99 are two-digit numbers, but when considering the hundreds place, it's only for three-digit numbers. So the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, in the units place, I thought both 4 and 8 had 49 occurrences. But let me make sure.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that in the units place, 4 and 8 each had 49 occurrences, but let me confirm.\n\nIn the units place, each complete group of ten (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has one 4 and one 8. There are 48 complete groups of ten in 480 pages, so 48 each. Then in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So units place total is 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, as calculated, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me double-check each step.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 488 pages, so 48 full decades (480 pages) and 8 extra pages.\n\nIn each decade, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So 48 each.\n\nIn the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8. So 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 for 4 and 4*10=40 for 8.\n\nBut the last hundred is only up to 488, so from 401-488, which is 88 pages. Let's see the tens digits here:\n\n- 401-409: tens digit 0\n- 410-419: tens digit 1\n- 420-429: tens digit 2\n- 430-439: tens digit 3\n- 440-449: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 450-459: tens digit 5\n- 460-469: tens digit 6\n- 470-479: tens digit 7\n- 480-488: tens digit 8 (9 pages)\n\nSo in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So adding to the previous 40 each:\n\n4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n\n8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nThat's correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Pages 1-99: no hundreds digit, so 0 for both 4 and 8.\n- Pages 100-399: hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, so 0 for both 4 and 8.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit 4, which is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but 90 seems a bit high. Let me see if I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, 488 - 400 + 1 is indeed 89, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, it's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the total number of 4's and 8's is to compute each digit's occurrence in each position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula for digit counting.\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated using a method where you divide the number into higher, current, and lower parts.\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, since I've already broken it down into units, tens, and hundreds, and double-checked each part, I think my counts are accurate.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nAnother way: The number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89, which is a significant contribution. The 8's don't appear in the hundreds place at all, so that's why the difference is so large.\n\nWait, let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit for 4 is 10 times (440-449) and for 8 is 9 times (480-488). So that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, looking at the units place. For every block of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, pages 4, 14, 24, etc. Since the book has 488 pages, the number of times 4 appears in the units place would be the number of complete tens in 488. \n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that means there are 48 complete tens. But actually, each ten contributes one 4 in the units place, so that would be 48 times. But wait, the last page is 488, which is part of the 488th page, so does that mean the units digit 4 appears 48 times? Hmm, but let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4. So that's 48 times.\n\nNext, the tens place for the digit 4. The tens digit is 4 in blocks of 100 pages. For example, from 40 to 49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 pages. Similarly, from 140 to 149, and so on. Let me figure out how many such blocks there are in 488 pages.\n\nEach hundred contains one block where the tens digit is 4. So from 1-100, 40-49 is one block; 101-200, 140-149 is another; 201-300, 240-249; 301-400, 340-349; and then 401-488, which would include 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So how many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1-400, there are four blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. Then from 401-488, the next block would be 440-449. So that's five blocks in total. Each block has 10 pages where the tens digit is 4, so that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 pages = 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So yes, that's correct. So 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for the digit 4. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So from 400 to 488, each page number has a hundreds digit of 4. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, every block of 10 pages has one 8 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. So 48 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: does 488 itself end with an 8? Yes, page 488 is the last page, so in the units place, 8 appears once more. So does that mean it's 49 times? Because 488 is included. So perhaps I was wrong earlier; maybe it's 49 times.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens, which is floor(488 / 10) = 48. But since 488 is included, the last block is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the 8 in the units place occurs at 488. So that's an extra 8. So total units place 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Because from 1 to 480, there are 480 pages, which is 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, that's 8 more pages, which includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more 8. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to calculate it as floor((488 + 1)/10) for the units digit. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just list some examples: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So how many terms are there? The first term is 8, the last term is 488, and the common difference is 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So yes, 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8. The tens digit is 8 in blocks of 100 pages. For example, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 times the digit 8 in the tens place, except maybe the last one.\n\nWait, from 80-89: 10 pages, so 10 times. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then 480-488: that's 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive). So how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here?\n\nWait, let me check: from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these pages. So 480-488 is 9 pages, each with an 8 in the tens place, right? Because 480 is 4-8-0, 481 is 4-8-1, up to 488, which is 4-8-8. So that's 9 times.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 4\u00d710=40, plus the 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, which would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So yes, 9 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8. The hundreds digit is 8 only when the page number is from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So the hundreds place for 8 contributes 0 times.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 49, so total 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 187. So the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4. But since 488 is included, does that add an extra 4 in the units place? Wait, 488 ends with an 8, so the units digit 4 would be at 484, right? So from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 occurs at 4,14,24,...,484. So how many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So n-1 = (484 - 4)/10 = 480/10 = 48, so n=49. Wait, so that's 49 times, not 48. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because 488 is 488, but the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 488. So the number of units place 4's is actually 49, not 48. Because from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so that changes things. So units place for 4 is 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, earlier I thought it was 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times. Let me check that again. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 pages, so 5 blocks \u00d710=50. So that's correct.\n\nAnd the hundreds place for 4 is from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488 is included, so units place 4's are 49, not 48. So that's a correction.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: as I thought earlier, 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 40, plus 480-488 contributing 9, so total 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo 4's: 188, 8's: 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now I'm getting 188. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when I first calculated units place for 4, I thought it was 48, but upon correction, it's 49. So units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, plus 89=188.\n\nFor 8's: units:49, tens:49, so 98.\n\nSo 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for 4. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's five blocks, each with 10 pages, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct.\n\nAnd hundreds place for 4 is from 400-488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So 89 times.\n\nUnits place for 4: 49 times, as 4,14,...,484: 484 is 4 + (n-1)*10, so n=49.\n\nSo 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0, so 98.\n\nDifference:188 - 98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 89, but now it's 90. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the units place for 4. Let me list the numbers:\n\nThe units digit 4 occurs at 4,14,24,...,484. So how many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So yes, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's units place:8,18,...,488. Last term is 488, so number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So that's correct.\n\nTens place for 8:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nWait, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times, not 10. So 4 blocks of 10 (each contributing 10) and one block of 9, so 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nSo 49 in tens place, 49 in units, total 98.\n\nSo 4's:188, 8's:98, difference=90.\n\nWait, but in the initial calculation, I thought the answer was 89, but after correcting the units place for 4, it's 90.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4. From 400 to 488, that's 488 -400 +1=89 pages, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nSo total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 in units is at 484, so 484/10=48.4, so 48 full cycles, plus one more at 484, making it 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units: same logic, 49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: Each hundred has a block of 10 where tens digit is 4. So from 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 pages, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\nNumber of 8's in tens digit: blocks are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four blocks are 10 each, the last is 9, so 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nNumber of 8's: since the book only goes up to 488, hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut earlier I thought it was 89, but that was before correcting the units place for 4's. So the correct answer is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check once more with a different approach. Maybe using a formula.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated using the formula for each digit position.\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), we can calculate the number of times d appears.\n\nLet me try applying that.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place from 1 to 488.\n\nWe can use the formula:\n\ncount = (N // 10) + 1 if the last digit is >=4 else (N //10).\n\nWait, but actually, the formula is a bit more involved. Let me recall.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is:\n\nfull_cycles = N // 10\n\ncount = full_cycles\n\nif the last digit (N % 10) >= d, then count +=1\n\nBut if d is 0, it's a bit different.\n\nSo for d=4:\n\nfull_cycles = 488 //10 =48\n\nlast_digit=488%10=8\n\nSince 8 >=4, count +=1\n\nSo total units place 4's:48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nfull_cycles=488//10=48\n\nlast_digit=8 >=8, so count +=1\n\nTotal units place 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor d=4:\n\nWe can calculate the number of times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nThe formula is a bit more complex. Let me think.\n\nThe number of times d appears in the tens place up to N is calculated by:\n\nhigher = N // 100\n\ncurrent = (N //10) %10\n\nlower = N %10\n\ncount = higher * 10\n\nif current > d: count +=10\n\nif current == d: count += lower +1\n\nBut wait, I might be mixing up some parts. Let me try to apply it.\n\nFor d=4 in tens place:\n\nhigher = 488 //100 =4\n\ncurrent = (488 //10) %10 =48%10=8\n\nlower=488%10=8\n\ncount = higher *10 =4*10=40\n\nsince current=8 >4, we add 10, so count=50.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because from 40-49, etc., we have 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n\nhigher=488//100=4\n\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=48%10=8\n\nlower=488%10=8\n\ncount=higher*10=4*10=40\n\nsince current=8 >=8, we add lower +1=8+1=9\n\nso total count=40+9=49.\n\nWhich matches our earlier count.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor d=4:\n\nhigher=488//1000=0\n\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4\n\nlower=488%100=88\n\ncount=higher*100=0\n\nif current >4: no, current=4\n\nso count += (lower +1) if current >=4\n\nsince current=4, count +=88+1=89\n\nso total hundreds place 4's:89.\n\nFor d=8 in hundreds place:\n\nhigher=488//1000=0\n\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4\n\nlower=488%100=88\n\ncount=higher*100=0\n\nsince current=4 <8, no addition.\n\nso total hundreds place 8's:0.\n\nSo adding up:\n\nFor 4's:\n\nunits:49\n\ntens:50\n\nhundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nunits:49\n\ntens:49\n\nhundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the answer was 89, but after correcting the units place, it's 90. So I think 90 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I made a mistake initially in counting the units place for 4's as 48 instead of 49. Once corrected, the total becomes 188 for 4's and 98 for 8's, leading to a difference of 90.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - The digit 4 appears once every 10 pages (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n     - Number of times = floor(488 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 pages: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n     - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n     - Number of pages = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - The digit 8 appears once every 10 pages (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - Number of times = floor(488 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 pages: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n     - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n     - Total = (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n     - Number of times = 0.\n\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I can look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. Maybe I can calculate how many 4's and 8's appear in each place and then compare them. Let me start by considering each place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in pages 1-10, the digits 1-9 each appear once, and 0 appears once in page 10. But wait, in our case, the pages go up to 488, so I need to figure out how many complete groups of ten there are and then see how many 4's and 8's are in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears ten times in a block of 100 numbers. For example, in pages 1-100, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place: 10-19 have 1 in the tens place, 20-29 have 2, and so on. The same logic applies to the hundreds place, but each digit appears 100 times in a block of 1000. However, since our book only has 488 pages, the hundreds place will only go up to 4, and not all the way to 9.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The hundreds digit in the page numbers will be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because 488 is less than 500. So, the hundreds place will have 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the hundreds place, I can calculate how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears. But since 8 is a single digit, and the hundreds place can only be up to 4, 8 won't appear in the hundreds place at all. That might be important.\n\nLet me structure this. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the units place, then in the tens place, then in the hundreds place, and then sum them up. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to get the answer.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor each group of 10 pages, a digit appears once in the units place. So, from page 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and an extra 8 pages. So, in each complete group of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 complete groups, that's 48 times 4's and 48 times 8's in the units place.\n\nNow, the extra 8 pages: pages 481 to 488. In the units place, the digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these 8 pages, the digit 4 appears once (page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, adding to the units place, 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the extra pages are 8, so pages 481-488. So, in the units place, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, yes, that adds one more to each.\n\nSo, total in units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, for example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (pages 1-9) to 9 (pages 90-99). Each digit appears 10 times. But our book goes up to 488, so we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then pages 401-488.\n\nSo, let me calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFirst, in each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSince we have 4 complete hundreds (1-400), each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 4 * 10 = 40 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining pages are from 401 to 488. Let's see how the tens digit behaves here.\n\nFrom 401-409: The tens digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's here.\nFrom 410-419: The tens digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\nFrom 420-429: The tens digit is 2, so no.\nFrom 430-439: Tens digit is 3, no.\nFrom 440-449: Tens digit is 4, so here, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (pages 440-449).\nFrom 450-459: Tens digit is 5, no.\nFrom 460-469: Tens digit is 6, no.\nFrom 470-479: Tens digit is 7, no.\nFrom 480-488: Tens digit is 8, so here, 8 appears 9 times because the pages go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 pages? Let me check: 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, but from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so each of those 9 pages contributes an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier, in each hundred, the 8's in the tens place were 10 times, but here, it's only 9 times because we don't go up to 489. So, in the incomplete hundred, we have 10 4's in the tens place (440-449) and 9 8's in the tens place (480-488).\n\nSo, adding that to the previous total:\n\n4's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n8's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digits are:\n\n401-410: tens digit 0\n411-420: tens digit 1\n421-430: tens digit 2\n431-440: tens digit 3\n441-450: tens digit 4 (but 440-449 is 10 pages, so 440-449, which is 10 pages, so tens digit 4 appears 10 times)\n451-460: tens digit 5\n461-470: tens digit 6\n471-480: tens digit 7\n481-490: tens digit 8, but we only go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 times.\n\nSo, yes, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each page number from 1-99 has no hundreds digit, so 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summing up:\n\nIn the hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's total up all the digits:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait a second, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nEach group of 10 pages has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 full groups (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488). In those 8 pages, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 48*1 +1=49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. 4 hundreds, so 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 gives 10 4's, and 480-488 gives 9 8's. So, 40+10=50 4's, 40+9=49 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\nSo, 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\n8's: 49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me cross-verify by another method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits place: For each 10 pages, one 4. From 1-488, how many 4's in units place?\n\nNumber of complete decades: 48 (since 488 /10 =48.8). So, 48*1=48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once. So, total 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 4's in tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) gives 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 is another 10 4's in tens place. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place: Same as 4's: 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages, 488 has an 8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 8's in tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's. So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll need to consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So I can calculate how many such blocks there are in 488 pages.\n\nFirst, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 full blocks and then a partial block from 481 to 488. Each full block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only number where 4 appears in the units place. So that's one more 4. So total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. So in each block of 100, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nEach full hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449. Let me check: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's another 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is within that range. So that's 10 more 4's. So total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because the partial hundred is from 401 to 488, which is 88 numbers. So the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 480-488). So the 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, that's correct, 10 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check that calculation again. 400 is the first page, and 488 is the last. So from 400 to 488, how many numbers? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So yes, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo total number of 4's is the sum of units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but that seems high. Let me check each step again.\n\nWait, when I calculated the units place, I had 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the partial block from 481-488, which has 484, so that's one more, making 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, each full hundred contributes 10 4's, so 4 full hundreds give 40, and the partial hundred from 401-488 includes 440-449, which is another 10, so 50 total. That seems correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, but let me check: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, okay.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then the partial block from 481-488: the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is the only number where 8 appears in the units place. So that's one more 8. So total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So for each full hundred, that's 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nWe have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the partial hundred from 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So the 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so from 480-488, the tens digit is 8. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the 4's calculation, I had 440-449 as 10 numbers because it's a full set. But here, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So in the tens place for 8's, it's 9 instead of 10.\n\nSo total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 (from partial hundred) = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So yes, 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, I have 98. So the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but that seems a bit high. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let's recount the 8's in the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. That seems correct. So 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the partial block where 488 is included, so one more, making 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm missing any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, and less than 4 for pages 1-399. So no 8's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nAnd for 8's, in the hundreds place, none, correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again for 8's. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the partial block from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 488 is included, which adds one more 8. So 48 + 1 = 49, correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 8's, from 1-400, each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So 40 + 9 = 49, correct.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nAnd total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for 4's would contribute more, but 89 seems correct. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full blocks of 10 (48 occurrences) + 1 in the partial block (484) = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full blocks of 100 (40 occurrences) + 10 in the partial block (440-449) = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full blocks of 10 (48 occurrences) + 1 in the partial block (488) = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full blocks of 100 (40 occurrences) + 9 in the partial block (480-488) = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that when dealing with digits in numbers, it's helpful to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So maybe I should calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once in the units place. So, if I can figure out how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10. The last group will have only 8 numbers (from 481 to 488). So, let's see. The total number of complete groups of 10 is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 groups with a remainder of 8. So, each digit (4 and 8) appears 48 times in the units place from the complete groups. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, they appear the same number of times.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). \n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an incomplete hundred from 401-488. \n\nIn each complete hundred, as I thought, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 for each digit. Now, looking at the incomplete hundred from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 in the 400s. \n\nWait, let me clarify. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we're only going to 488, it's 481-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. Hmm, actually, let me check: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481, 482, ..., up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the incomplete hundred. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the incomplete hundred. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, in the incomplete hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nTherefore, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from incomplete hundred) = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from incomplete hundred) = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me double-check. In the incomplete hundred from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit, how many times does it appear? For example, tens digit 0 appears from 401-410, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, tens digit 1 appears from 411-420, which is 10 numbers, and so on up to tens digit 8, which appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). Therefore, in the incomplete hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nSo, adding to the complete hundreds, 4 appears 4*10 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 4*10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place? \n\nFor 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so 4 and 8 don't appear here. Similarly, for 200-299, the hundreds digit is 2, so again, 4 and 8 don't appear. For 300-399, the hundreds digit is 3, so same thing. Now, for 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so the digit 4 appears here. Specifically, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The highest hundreds digit is 4. So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. Therefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total appearances of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- 4 appears 49 times\n- 8 appears 49 times\n\nTens place:\n- 4 appears 50 times\n- 8 appears 49 times\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nSo, total for 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times.\n\nTotal for 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8.\n- Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n- 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10 = 40 each.\n- In the incomplete hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, 89 for 4 and 0 for 8. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n- 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But let me think again if I considered all cases correctly.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n- As before, 49 times each.\n\nFor tens place:\n- 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up, 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each group of 10 numbers has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, contributing 48 each.\n- The last 8 numbers (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- Total: 49 each.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8.\n- 4 complete hundreds contribute 40 each.\n- In the incomplete hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- Total: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n- Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 - 98 = 90\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the approach here is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference. So, I need to calculate the total number of 4's and the total number of 8's separately.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. For each position, I'll figure out how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, for each full set of 10 numbers, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, how many full blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each of these 48 blocks, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 8 appears once in the units place, but 4 doesn't appear because the units digits here are 1 to 8, and 4 is included, right? Wait, 481 has a units digit of 1, 482 is 2, up to 488 which is 8. So, in these 8 numbers, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit for 488 is 8. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 4's and 8's are there? Let's calculate.\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: For each 10 numbers, one 4. So, 48 full tens give 48 fours, and in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So total 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: Each 10 numbers, one 8. So, 48 full tens give 48 eights, and in the last 8 numbers, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So total 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the count so far is 49 fours and 49 eights. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake here because 488 is included, so let me check again.\n\nWait, from 1 to 480, there are 480 pages. Each 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 480/10 = 48, so 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), up to 9 (90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, from 1 to 400, there are 4 full hundreds. Then, from 401 to 488, that's 88 pages.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of 4's in the tens place.\n\nIn each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, for each hundred, 10 fours in the tens place. Since there are 4 full hundreds (1-400), that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours in the tens place from 1-400.\n\nNow, from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490). But since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for these 8 numbers. \n\nWait, but in the tens place, from 401 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: The tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449. So, from 401 to 488, 440-449 is within that range. So, that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 fours in the tens place from 401-488.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, that's 10 fours. So, total fours in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 fours.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, how about the number of 8's in the tens place? Similarly, in each hundred, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4*10=40 eights.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for these 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place from 401-488.\n\nWait, but wait: 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total eights in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49 eights.\n\nSo, in the tens place, we have 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, how about 8 in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with hundreds digit 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal eights in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 full tens (1-480) give 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, 481-488 adds one four (484) and one eight (488), so 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, fours in tens place: 440-449 is 10 fours. Eights in tens place: 480-488 is 9 eights. So, fours: 40 +10=50, eights:40 +9=49. That looks correct.\n\nHundreds place: Fours from 400-488: 89 fours. Eights: none, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place might have more, but no, it's 89 fours and 0 eights. So, the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, let me check again the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd for eights, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no page 800 or above, so no eights in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the total number of fours is 188, and eights is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such sets are there up to 488? Well, each hundred has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100, 100-200, 200-300, 300-400, and 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, and then 410-419, etc., but wait, no, the tens digit is 4 only in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, so 4 times 10 = 40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 would be in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, no, that's not right. The tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but each of these is a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, in the 400-488 range, how many such sets are there? Let's see: 400-409 is one set, 410-419 is another, up to 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, so actually, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479. That's 8 sets (from 400 to 470 in steps of 10), each contributing 10 numbers. So that's 8*10=80. But wait, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, which is 8 sets (since 400 to 479 is 80 numbers, so 8 sets of 10). Each set contributes one 4 in the tens place, so that's 8 times. Plus, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, so no additional 4's there. So, in the 400-488 range, we have 8 sets where the tens digit is 4, contributing 8*10=80? Wait, no, that's the count of numbers, but we're counting the number of 4's in the tens place. Each set contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so each set contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 8 sets would contribute 8*10=80 4's in the tens place. But wait, from 1-400, how many 4's in the tens place? Let's see: from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Similarly, from 101-200, 140-149, another 10. From 201-300, 240-249, another 10. From 301-400, 340-349, another 10. So that's 4*10=40 4's in the tens place from 1-400. Then, from 401-488, as we saw, 8 sets where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 4's, so 8*10=80. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the tens digit cycles from 0-8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479. That's 8 sets (from 400 to 470 in steps of 10), each with 10 numbers, so 8*10=80 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 (from 1-400) + 80 (from 401-488) = 120. Wait, that can't be right because from 1-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in each hundred block once every 100 numbers, so 4 times 100, but actually, from 1-400, it's 4 sets, each contributing 10 4's, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, as we said, 8 sets, each contributing 10 4's, so 80. So total 4's in tens place is 40+80=120.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so maybe I'm overcounting. Let me check again. From 1-100: 40-49, 10 numbers, 10 4's in tens place. From 101-200: 140-149, 10. From 201-300: 240-249, 10. From 301-400: 340-349, 10. So that's 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, but wait, 401-409 is part of 400-409, which is 10 numbers, but 400 is included in 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 includes 400, so from 400-409, that's 10 numbers, but 400 is page 400, which is included. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 8 sets (from 400 to 470 in steps of 10). So, 8*10=80 4's in the tens place from 400-488. So total 4's in tens place is 40+80=120.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 489, so the last set would be 480-488, but the tens digit is 8 there, so no 4's in the tens place beyond 470-479. So, 8 sets in 400-488, each contributing 10 4's, so 80. So total 4's in tens place is 40+80=120.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's would be units place (49) + tens place (120) + hundreds place (89) = 49+120=169, 169+89=258.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens place: 120, hundreds place:89. 49+120=169, 169+89=258. So, 258 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, for every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1-488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete sets, contributing 48 8's, and then in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many such sets are there up to 488? From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4*10=40 8's in the tens place from 1-400. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many 8's in the tens place here? Each number from 480-488 has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 numbers, but since we're counting digits, each contributes one 8, so 9 8's.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from 1-400) +9=49.\n\nWait, let me confirm. From 1-100: 80-89, 10 numbers, 10 8's. From 101-200: 180-189, 10. From 201-300: 280-289, 10. From 301-400: 380-389, 10. So that's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total 8's would be units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nSo, total 4's:258, total 8's:98. The difference is 258-98=160.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\nUnits place: For each 10 numbers, 1 four. 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, 48 fours, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units place, so 1 more, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). From 1-400, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, which is 8 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 80. So total 40+80=120. Plus the hundreds place, which is 89 fours (from 400-488). So, 120+89=209, plus units place 49, total 258. Wait, no, earlier I added 49+120=169, then +89=258. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets, 48 eights, plus 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, 4 sets, each 10 eights, so 40. From 401-488, 480-488, which is 9 eights. So, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0. So total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:258-98=160.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 488-400+1=89. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 258, and the number of 8's is 98, so there are 160 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is calculated by counting their occurrences in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers from 1 to 488. Similarly, the number of 8's is counted. After calculating both, the difference is found to be 160.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 fours. The last partial set (481-488) adds one more 4 (484). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In each hundred, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). From 1-400, there are 4 sets, contributing 40 fours. From 401-488, there are 8 sets, contributing 80 fours. Total: 120.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 fours.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 120 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 258.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 eights. The last partial set (481-488) adds one more (488). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In each hundred, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). From 1-400, there are 4 sets, contributing 40 eights. From 401-488, 480-488 contributes 9 eights. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - 4's: 258\n   - 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 258 - 98 = 160\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{160}."

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first thing I should do is figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Here, 4 appears once (at 4) and 8 appears once (at 8).\n\nNow, how many such groups of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll have 48 complete groups and then an extra 8 pages (481 to 488). Wait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490, but wait, 488 is less than 490, so actually the last group is 481-488). Hmm, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider how many times each digit appears in each place without worrying about the exact groupings. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nIn the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each position, except possibly the last partial group. So, the total number of page numbers is 488. The number of times each digit appears in the units place is generally the total number of pages divided by 10, rounded down, plus any extra in the last partial group.\n\nSo, for the units place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place = (488 // 10) + (1 if 4 <= (488 % 10) else 0). Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Actually, for the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears floor(488/10) times, which is 48 times, and then for the remaining 8 pages (since 488 = 48*10 + 8), the digits 1 through 8 appear once each. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times (from each complete group of ten) plus 1 more time because 4 is less than or equal to 8. So total 49 times. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times plus 1, so 49 times as well. Wait, but that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the last page is 488, meaning the units digits go up to 8. So, for units digit 4: 48 full groups (each contributing one 4) plus one more in the last group because 4 \u2264 8, so 49 times. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times plus one more, so 49 times. So both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For example, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 pages, 4 appears once. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, and then in the last 8 pages (481-488), 484 is the only page where the units digit is 4, so that's one more. So total 49 times. Similarly, 8 appears once every 10 pages, so 48 times, plus 488 has 8 in the units place, so that's one more, making it 49 times. So both digits appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, ..., 9 for 90-99. So each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, which is less than 500, we have four hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. But for the tens digit, let's see how many times each digit appears.\n\nIn each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 1-99, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. For 100-199, same thing: 10 times each digit in the tens place. Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399. Now, for 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, each appearing 10 times except for the last partial group.\n\nWait, but let's think carefully. From 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times, not 10. So, in the tens place for 400-488, each digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. Actually, from 400-488, the tens digits are 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times in 400-488, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all page numbers.\n\nFirst, for 1-399: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. There are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). So, for each digit, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. So, 4 appears 40 times, and 8 appears 40 times in the tens place for 1-399.\n\nNow, for 400-488: As established, 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (from 440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 400-488, the tens digits are 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), 3 (430-439), 4 (440-449), 5 (450-459), 6 (460-469), 7 (470-479), and 8 (480-488). Each of these tens digits appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding to the previous counts:\n\n- 4 in tens place: 40 (from 1-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50\n- 8 in tens place: 40 (from 1-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in page numbers from 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, there's no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2, and so on up to 400-488, where it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 page numbers. Therefore, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The highest hundreds digit is 4. So, 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units and tens counts because I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. But let me confirm that again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 pages, so 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 49 times. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times plus once in the last 8 pages, so 49 times. So that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. That seems correct because in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, while 8 appears 9 times, adding to the previous counts.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 49 + 50 + 89: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct.\n\n49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it as the hundreds digit being 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the hundreds digit is to consider that each hundred block contributes 100 pages, but since 488 is less than 500, we only have up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nSo, yeah, that seems right.\n\nWait, but another way to check: How many times does each digit appear in each place.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (1 if 4 <= 488%10 else 0) = 48 + 1 = 49\nSimilarly for 8's: 48 +1=49\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)*10 + (if 488 >= 440 +10, then 10 else (488 - 440 +1)).\n\nWait, maybe a better formula is:\n\nFor tens digit, the number of times a digit d appears is:\n\nLet me think. For each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 1-488, the number of hundreds is 4 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40 times for each digit in the tens place up to 399.\n\nThen, in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for each digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digits are 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., 8 (480-488). Each of these is 10 pages except for the last one, which is 9 pages (480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488).\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times (440-449). For digit 8, it's 9 times (480-488). So, adding to the previous 40 times each, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount, so let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position:\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers: 488\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears floor(488/10) = 48 times, plus an extra for digits \u2264 (488 mod 10) which is 8. So, digits 1-8 get one extra, 9 and 0 get none.\n\nSo, units digit count for 4: 48 +1=49\nSimilarly for 8: 48 +1=49\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit appears floor(488/100) =4 times, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, for the remaining 88 pages (since 4*100=400, so 488-400=88), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n\nSo, for each digit from 0-8, how many times do they appear in the tens place in 400-488?\n\nEach digit from 0-8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nThus, total in tens place:\n\n4: 40 +10=50\n8:40 +9=49\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 times.\n\n8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n4: 49 +50 +89=188\n8:49 +49 +0=98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to calculate the hundreds place. Since the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, yeah, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll go through each position one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers. So in 1-10, it's at 4; 11-20 at 14, and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, I can calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place by dividing 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 48 full groups and then an extra 8 pages. So in the units place, 4 appears 48 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Each group of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many such groups are there? Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, the last group would be 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the units digit 4 appears once more in 484. So actually, it's 48 times plus one more, making it 49 times in the units place. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, no, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups (each contributing one 4 in the units place) and then an additional 8 numbers (481-488). In those 8 numbers, the units digit is 4 only once (484). So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges are there in 488 pages.\n\n- From 1-488, the first range is 40-49: that's 10 numbers.\n- Next is 140-149: another 10.\n- Then 240-249: another 10.\n- Then 340-349: another 10.\n- Then 440-449: another 10.\n- Now, after 449, the next would be 540-549, but since we only go up to 488, that range doesn't exist. So how many full ranges do we have? Let's count: 40-49 (1), 140-149 (2), 240-249 (3), 340-349 (4), 440-449 (5). Each contributes 10, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's included. So the tens place has 50 occurrences of 4.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So total 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So total 4's printed are 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, similar to 4. So from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each group of 10 has one 8, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So total units place 8's are 48 +1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is only up to 488.\n\nLet's count each range:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- 180-189: another 10.\n- 280-289: another 10.\n- 380-389: another 10.\n- 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, but the numbers go up to 488, so how many numbers are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So the tens digit is 8 in all these 9 numbers.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 4 ranges \u00d710 = 40, plus 9 from the last partial range, totaling 49.\n\nWait, let me make sure. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 8 in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 =98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 49+49=98, yes. So total 8's are 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in the tens place were 49, which includes the 480-488 range. So total 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98.\n\nSo 188-98=90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in each place?\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, plus one more in the last partial group (484). So 49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49:1, 140-149:2, 240-249:3, 340-349:4, 440-449:5. So 5 ranges, each with 10, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: same logic, 48 full groups (1-480), each contributing one 8, and then 481-488 has 488, so one more. So 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: no 8's, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo 188-98=90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So yes, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 4's, 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49, correct.\n\nFor 8's, units and tens each 49, so total 98. Correct.\n\nSo 188-98=90. So the answer is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there a possibility that in the hundreds place for 4's, I'm counting correctly? For example, 400-488 includes all numbers where the hundreds digit is 4, right? Yes, because 400 is the first number with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each range contributes 10, and the last partial range for 480-488 contributes 9, but wait, no, for 4's, the tens place is in 440-449, which is fully within 488, so that's 10. The last range for 8's is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but that's for 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, no, in the case of 4's, the tens place goes up to 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. Then, 450-488 don't affect the tens place for 4's beyond that.\n\nWait, so I think my counts are correct. So the difference is 90.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try another approach: count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately.\n\nAlternatively, I could write a small table for each digit position and count the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. So the number of such numbers is floor(488/10)=48, but since 484 is included, it's 48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: Numbers where the tens digit is 4. These are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d710=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: Numbers where the hundreds digit is 4, which are 400-488. That's 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: Numbers ending with 8:8,18,28,...,488. So from 1 to 488, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, plus one more in 488. So 49.\n\n- Tens place: Numbers where the tens digit is 8:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four ranges have 10 numbers each, and the last range has 9 numbers (480-488). So 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: No numbers from 800-899, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

    "text": " \n\nI guess the approach here is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference. That makes sense. So, I'll need to go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Wait, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4, right? Because 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For each group of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. So, how many complete groups of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and then 8 more pages (481-488). \n\nIn each complete group of ten, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 groups, that's 48 times 1 for 4's and 48 times 1 for 8's. So, units place contributes 48 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, for the incomplete group, which is 481-488. Let's look at the units digits here: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in this group, the digit 4 appears once (page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, adding that, the units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 48 groups give 48 each, and the last 8 pages add one each, so total units place is 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. So, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, for each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (like 80-89). \n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so actually, it's four complete hundreds (1-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nWait, no, actually, 488 is 4*100 + 88, so the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. So, that's four complete hundreds and then 88 pages. \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (pages 40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (pages 80-89). So, for four hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 4's in the tens place and 4*10 = 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the incomplete hundred, 401-488? Let's see, the tens digit here cycles from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). \n\nSo, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear here? Looking at the range 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in pages 440-449. Wait, no, 401-488 is from 401 to 488, so the tens digit 4 would be in pages 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 pages, so 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in pages 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's pages 480-488. So, that's 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the incomplete hundred.\n\nWait, but wait, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For the tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the incomplete hundred, the tens place contributes 10 4's and 9 8's.\n\nAdding that to the four complete hundreds, which gave 40 each, the total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 4's and 40 + 9 = 49 8's.\n\nSo, so far, for units and tens places, we have:\n\nUnits: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Wait, in the tens place, the four complete hundreds each contribute 10 4's and 10 8's, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in the incomplete hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place: 40+10=50 4's and 40+9=49 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have confused the hundreds. Wait, 401-488 is part of the 400-488 range, which is the fourth hundred. So, perhaps I should consider that the four hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so the hundreds digit is 0 for those. Pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From page 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nHow about the hundreds digit 8? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear at all. Therefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, I thought in the units place, it was 49 for both, in the tens place, 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's, and hundreds place 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought earlier that in the tens place, 8's were 49, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for 8's, in the four complete hundreds, each contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (pages 480-488). So, total 8's in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, for each complete group of 10, 48 groups give 48 4's and 48 8's, and the last 8 pages add one more each, so 49 each. So, units place is 49 for both.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's don't appear at all.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's total: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and see if I get the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a formula for counting digits in each place.\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of complete cycles of 10 in 488 pages is 48 (since 488 // 10 = 48), each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 +1 = 49 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of complete cycles of 100 in 488 is 4 (since 488 // 100 = 4). Each cycle contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 each.\n\nThen, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) have tens digits from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It's from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 4's.\n\nHow about 8? It's from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 4's and 40 + 9 = 49 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of pages where hundreds digit is 4 is from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\n8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can check a smaller example to see if my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a 20-page book. How many 1's and 2's are there?\n\nLet's count 1's:\n\nUnits place: 1,11,21 (but 21 is beyond 20). So, 1 appears in units place at 1 and 11, so 2 times.\n\nTens place: 10-19, which is 10 times, so 10 times.\n\nSo, total 1's: 2 + 10 = 12.\n\n2's:\n\nUnits place: 2,12,22 (but 22 is beyond 20), so 2 and 12, so 2 times.\n\nTens place: 20, which is 1 time.\n\nSo, total 2's: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nDifference: 12 - 3 = 9.\n\nWait, but let's count manually:\n\nPages 1-20:\n\n1: 1\n2: 2\n3: 3\n4: 4\n5:5\n6:6\n7:7\n8:8\n9:9\n10:10\n11:11\n12:12\n13:13\n14:14\n15:15\n16:16\n17:17\n18:18\n19:19\n20:20\n\nCounting 1's:\n\nUnits: 1,11 \u2192 2\nTens: 10-19 \u2192 10\nTotal: 12.\n\n2's:\n\nUnits: 2,12 \u2192 2\nTens: 20 \u21921\nTotal:3.\n\nSo, difference is 9, which matches the calculation.\n\nSo, my method seems correct for this small case. Therefore, I can be more confident that the approach is correct.\n\nSo, applying the same method to the original problem, the difference is 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n### Units Place:\n- Each group of 10 pages contributes 1 occurrence of both 4 and 8.\n- There are 48 complete groups of 10 pages, contributing 48 occurrences each.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute 1 occurrence each of 4 and 8.\n- Total in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\) for both 4 and 8.\n\n### Tens Place:\n- Each group of 100 pages contributes 10 occurrences of both 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n- There are 4 complete groups of 100 pages, contributing \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\) occurrences each.\n- The remaining 88 pages (401-488) contribute 10 occurrences of 4 (440-449) and 9 occurrences of 8 (480-488).\n- Total in tens place: \\(40 + 10 = 50\\) for 4 and \\(40 + 9 = 49\\) for 8.\n\n### Hundreds Place:\n- Pages 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences of 4.\n- 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only has 488 pages.\n- Total in hundreds place: 89 for 4 and 0 for 8.\n\n### Total Counts:\n- **4's**: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\)\n- **8's**: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\)\n\n### Difference:\n- The number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by \\(188 - 98 = 90\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have those counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet's start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the digit 4 appears once (at page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (at page 8). This pattern repeats every 10 pages. \n\nFirst, I need to find out how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages. Dividing 488 by 10 gives me 48 complete groups, with 8 pages remaining (since 48*10 = 480, and 488 - 480 = 8). \n\nIn each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so for 48 groups, that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nSo, total 4's in the units place: 48 (from the complete groups) + 1 (from the remaining pages) = 49. \nTotal 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here because I thought 4's would be more. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, no, 488 is the last page, so the remaining pages after 480 are 481 to 488. So, in the units place for these, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So yes, 1 each. So, units place: 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. For example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, then 10-19 it's 1, and so on. \n\nI think the way to calculate this is to consider each hundred block. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each (for each hundred). Wait, no, actually, for each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, in 1-100, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. \n\nBut wait, from 1-99, the tens digit cycles 10 times each, but starting from 10. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of hundreds. Let's consider the entire range up to 488.\n\nSo, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, for each hundred, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. So, for 1-100, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for 101-200, it's the same, and so on.\n\nBut since 488 is less than 500, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then the remaining 88 pages (401-488).\n\nWait, no, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, from 1-400, there are 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, each digit 0-9 appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining pages: 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 481-488). So, the tens digit cycles through 0-8 in this range.\n\nSo, for each tens digit in 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: pages 401-410 \u2192 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420 \u2192 10 times.\n- ...\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488 \u2192 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- Digit 4 appears in the tens place from 441-450, which is 10 pages. Wait, no, 441-450 would be tens digit 4, but since we're only going up to 488, 441-450 is within 401-488. So, that's 10 times.\n- Digit 8 appears in the tens place from 481-488, which is 8 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens digit in 401-488 would go up to 8, but in reality, 481-488 is the tens digit 8, which is 8 pages. So, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nSo, total in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 40 + 10 = 50.\n- Digit 8: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, that can't be right because from 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, but for digit 8, it's only 8 pages, so 8 times. So, total 48 times for 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the range 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-488. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, the number of times each digit appears in the tens place is:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 10 pages (401-410)\n- Tens digit 1: 10 pages (411-420)\n- ...\n- Tens digit 8: 8 pages (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- Digit 4 appears when the tens digit is 4, which is from 441-450. That's 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- Digit 8 appears when the tens digit is 8, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50\n- Digit 8: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nDigit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4's and 8's across all places.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full groups (48*10=480) plus 8 pages (481-488).\n- In the units place, 4 appears once in each group (48 times) and once in the remaining pages (484), so 49.\n- Similarly, 8 appears once in each group (48 times) and once in the remaining pages (488), so 49.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- From 1-400: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 for each digit.\n- From 401-488: Tens digit goes from 0 to 8.\n  - Digit 4 in tens place: 441-450 \u2192 10 pages.\n  - Digit 8 in tens place: 481-488 \u2192 8 pages.\n- So, total for 4's in tens: 40 + 10 = 50.\n- Total for 8's in tens: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nThat looks correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n- Digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place in 1-488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe the difference was 91, but I want to make sure I didn't miscount in the hundreds place. Let me check:\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all, since 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, yes, 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the difference would be smaller, but maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the hundreds place: For 400-488, each page number starts with 4, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all those pages. So, 89 times.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97, so 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups (480 pages) and 8 remaining pages (481-488).\n   - **4's:** 48 (from groups) + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - **8's:** 48 (from groups) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 for each digit.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - **4's:** 10 (441-450).\n     - **8's:** 8 (481-488).\n   - **4's Total:** 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **8's Total:** 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** 89 (400-488).\n   - **8's:** 0 (no page numbers in 800-888).\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should start by figuring out how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the counts for each digit, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of those 48 sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra numbers from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is in there, which means the digit 4 appears once more in the units place. So, total for units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, actually, page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the 40-49 range, which is 10 times. Then, in 140-149, another 10 times, and similarly in 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10 times. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's count: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times. \n\nWait, but wait a second. 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. But does 440-449 end at 449, and then 450-488 is after that. So, yeah, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll start with the units place.\n\nIn the units place, similar to the 4's, in every block of ten, 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 occurrence of 8 in the units place. That's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more occurrence. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last block. So, how many such blocks are there?\n\n80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place for that block.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus the last block 480-488 contributing 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that: 49 + 49 is 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems high. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me go back and check each step.\n\nStarting with the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit 4 is at 484, so that's 1 more. So, 49 total. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 10 each, 50 total. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That adds up.\n\nNow for the 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 blocks of 10, 1 each, so 48. Then, in the last block (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place, so 1 more. Total 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 blocks of 10, which is 40, plus 9, total 49. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. That's correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems correct based on the calculations. Maybe it's right after all.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for 4's and 8's?\n\nFor the 4's in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 10 each, 50 total. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks are 10 each, so 40, and the last block is 9, so 49 total. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the last block for 8's in the tens place. 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 489, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. That's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** In every block of ten numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete blocks (1-480) and one partial block (481-488). In the partial block, 484 has a 4 in the units place. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are five such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences. Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once per block of ten. There are 48 complete blocks and one partial block (481-488) where 488 has an 8. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are four complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and a partial block (480-488) with 9 occurrences. Total: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (800-899 exceeds 488). Total: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first thing I should do is figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the positions where the digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I think I'll handle each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** For every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last partial set from 481 to 488 also includes 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So that's 49 fours in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers, such as 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes ten 4's in the tens place. Let me figure out how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is one block. Then 140-149 is another, 240-249 is another, and 340-349 is another. Wait, 488 is less than 490, so the last block would be 440-449. Let me check: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks. Each contributes ten 4's, so 5 times 10 is 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nNow, adding up the fours from each place: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours in total.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For units place, I had 48 complete sets of ten, each giving one 4, so 48, and then the 480-488 range adds one more, making 49. For tens place, I had five blocks, each giving ten 4's, so 50. For hundreds place, from 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers, so 89. Adding them up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488? As before, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. That's 48 eights. But wait, the last partial set from 481 to 488 includes 488, which is another 8 in the units place. So that's 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** For the tens place, the digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count the blocks:\n\n   - 80-89: 10 numbers, so ten 8's in the tens place.\n   - 180-189: another ten 8's.\n   - 280-289: another ten.\n   - 380-389: another ten.\n   - 480-488: this is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, right? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So in the tens place, each of these contributes one 8, so 9 eights.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of ten (each contributing ten 8's) and one block of nine (contributing nine 8's). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Each block is ten numbers, but the last block is only nine numbers because 488 is the last page. So, how many full blocks are there? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so ten 8's in tens place.\n- 180-189: another ten.\n- 280-289: another ten.\n- 380-389: another ten.\n- 480-488: nine numbers, so nine 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks of ten and one block of nine. So, total eights in tens place: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is nine numbers. So, in the tens place, each of these blocks contributes ten 8's except the last one, which contributes nine. So, that's 4 full blocks (each giving ten 8's) and one partial block giving nine. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights in total.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 48 full sets of ten, each giving one 8, so 48, plus the last partial set from 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more, making 49. Tens place: as above, 49. So total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, subtracting the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. When I was counting the blocks for tens place eights, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks gives ten eights in the tens place, and the last block gives nine. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the tens place, I had five blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each gives ten fours, so 5*10 = 50. Correct.\n\nAnd for the hundreds place, fours are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nSo, yeah, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 from complete decades, plus 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (five blocks of ten, each contributing ten 4's).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 from complete decades, plus 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (four full blocks of ten, plus nine from 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (no page numbers in 800-899).\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first thing I need to do is count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers, right? So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there? Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full blocks and then a partial block from 481 to 488. In each full block, there's one 4, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in 484. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second, 488 divided by 10 is actually 48.8, meaning 48 full tens and then 8 extra numbers. So, the 48th block ends at 480, and then the next block starts at 481. So, from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers, and the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, 484 is in there, so that's one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, right? For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nLet me calculate how many hundreds are there. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds and then a partial hundred from 400-488.\n\nIn each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the tens place has 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 full hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, the partial hundred is from 400-488. Here, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is less than 490, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488. So that's another 10 occurrences. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 page numbers. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me confirm: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nAgain, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the partial block from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is included, so yes, that's one more 8 in the units place. So 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488.\n\nSo, each full hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many full hundreds there are.\n\n488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each contributes 10, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the partial hundred from 400-488 includes 480-488. The tens digit here is 8, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. I had 89 occurrences because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. But let me confirm: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, in the hundreds place, there are none because the book ends at 488, which is less than 800. So that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, 8's: 98, difference: 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the units place for 4's. Let me recount that.\n\nUnits place for 4's: from 1-488, every 10 numbers, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, which is one more 4. So total 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then 488 adds another 8, so 49.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 8's, I had 49. Let me check again: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 10*4 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. With 48 full decades (48 occurrences) and one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10. Four full hundreds give 40, plus 10 in 440-449, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. With 48 full decades and one more in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10. Four full hundreds give 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. \n\nSo, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an additional 8 pages. \n\nIn each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, in each block of 10, it appears once. So, 48 times from the complete blocks. In the remaining 8 pages, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. That means the difference here is zero. Interesting, so the difference must come from the tens and hundreds places.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for a block of 100 pages. Specifically, each digit appears 10 times in each block of 100. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each.\n\nSo, let's calculate how many complete hundreds are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, which means there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times per hundred. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the additional 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 401-410, the tens digit is 0, then 411-420, it's 1, and so on. Wait, actually, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place in the range 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 (from the hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, in each complete hundred, it appears 10 times. So, 4 * 10 = 40 times. In the additional 88 pages, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488). Wait, no, actually, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the additional 88 pages. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. That means there's a difference of 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Let's see, pages 1-99 have no hundreds digit, so the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore. Pages 100-199 have a hundreds digit of 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400 to 488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times, which is a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit position.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Each 10 pages contribute 1 four and 1 eight.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full tens and 8 extra pages.\n- So, 48 fours and 48 eights from the full tens.\n- In the extra 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so one four (484) and one eight (488).\n- So, total fours: 48 +1 =49, eights:48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights.\n- Then, pages 401-488: the tens digit goes from 0 to 8.\n- For fours in tens place: 440-449 is 10 fours. So, total fours: 40 +10=50.\n- For eights in tens place: 480-488 is 9 eights. So, total eights:40 +9=49.\n- Difference here is 50-49=1 more four.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages.\n- So, 89 fours.\n- No eights in hundreds place.\n- Difference here is 89.\n\nTotal fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)= 188\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 49\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - Pages 401-488: 440-449 contribute 10 4's, and 480-488 contribute 9 8's.\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 49\n\n3. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's.\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n4. **Calculating Totals:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Finding the Difference:**\n   - Difference = 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nI remember that when dealing with digit counting problems, it's helpful to consider each digit position separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. In this case, since 488 is a three-digit number, I should look at each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) for both the digit 4 and the digit 8. \n\nLet me start by thinking about how often each digit appears in each position. For the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, for example, in the range 1-10, the units digit is 4 once (page 4) and 8 once (page 8). Similarly, from 11-20, it's 14 and 18, and so on. \n\nBut wait, the book goes up to 488, so I can't just stop at a multiple of 10. I need to account for the entire range up to 488. Maybe I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 and then handle the remaining pages. \n\nLet me try that. For the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each set of 10 pages. So, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens multiplied by 1 (since each set of 10 contributes one instance of the digit in the units place). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers, so the total number of times a digit appears in the units place is the total number of pages divided by 10, rounded down, plus any extra if the remaining pages include that digit. \n\nLet me formalize this. For the units digit, the number of times a digit d appears is equal to:\n\n- The number of complete decades (groups of 10) is floor(total pages / 10). So, for 488 pages, that's floor(488 / 10) = 48 complete decades. Each decade contributes one occurrence of each digit in the units place. So, for digits 4 and 8, each would appear 48 times in the units place.\n\nBut wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10) is indeed 48. Now, after these 48 decades, there are 8 remaining pages (from 481 to 488). In these remaining pages, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more (page 484) and the digit 8 appears once more (page 488). \n\nTherefore, the total number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8, meaning 4 appears once and 8 appears once in the remaining 8 pages. So, both digits 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences in the units place. \n\nHmm, but wait, let me check that again. From 1 to 480, that's 48 decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 times each. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total for units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. So, same count. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in the range 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49 (10 times) and 8 for pages 80-89 (10 times). \n\nBut again, since we're only going up to 488, we need to adjust for that. Let's break it down:\n\n- From 1-100: tens digits 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n- From 101-200: same, each appears 10 times.\n- From 201-300: same, 10 times each.\n- From 301-400: same, 10 times each.\n- From 401-488: Now, here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit 4, it appears in pages 401-410 (10 times), but wait, 401-410 would be pages 401 to 410, but 488 is the last page, so after 400, we go up to 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). \n\nWait, but 488 is page 488, so the tens digit in 480-488 is 8. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear in 401-488? It's from 401-410, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page, but 480 is included). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488), but actually, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is page 480, and 488 is page 488, so from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the 401-488 range.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The tens digit is determined by the second digit from the right. So, for example, 401-410: tens digit is 0 (since it's 401, 402,...,410). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 401 is 4 0 1, so the tens digit is 0. 410 is 4 1 0, so the tens digit is 1. So, in 401-410, the tens digits go from 0 to 1, not 4. Hmm, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, I think I confused the hundreds and tens digits. Let me correct this. The hundreds digit is the first digit, the tens digit is the second, and the units is the third. So, for page numbers from 401 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit cycles from 0 up to 8. So, in 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; and so on, up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. \n\nSo, in the range 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs when the tens place is 4, which would be from 440-449. That's 10 pages, so the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds do we have? From 1-400, there are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these hundreds contributes 10 occurrences of the tens digit 4 and 10 occurrences of the tens digit 8. So, for each hundred, 10 times each digit. \n\nSo, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 times each for digits 4 and 8 in the tens place. \n\nBut wait, in the 401-488 range, we have an additional 10 times for 4 (from 440-449) and 9 times for 8 (from 480-488). \n\nSo, total for the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times for 4, and 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times for 8.\n\nWait, but hold on. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 for each digit. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the first digit. For pages 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0, but since we're only counting digits that are printed, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit. Pages 100-488 have a hundreds digit. \n\nThe hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total for the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences for each digit in each place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 488 pages, so 48 full decades (480 pages), each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 in units place, so 48 each.\n- Remaining 8 pages: 481-488. Units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units total: 48 +1=49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n- From 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 40 each.\n- From 401-488: Tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times), and tens digit 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n- So, total tens: 40 +10=50 for 4, 40 +9=49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n- Total complete decades: 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 complete decades.\n- Each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n- Remaining 8 pages (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n- Total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit appears 10 times per hundred.\n- From 1-400: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n- From 401-488:\n  - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n  - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- Total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4; 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 more pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, plus one more time in the 480-488 range (which is 484). So that's 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, and so on up to 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn the range 1-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10 numbers. Same for 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers. For 300-399: 340-349, another 10. Now, for 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond 449, so that's fine. So, that's 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) where the tens digit is 4. Each block contributes 10, so that's 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, that's correct, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the units, tens, and hundreds places for 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus one more in 484, so 49. Tens place: 10 per hundred, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, etc.), so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in every set of ten, 8 appears once in the units place. So, up to 488, how many sets of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the 8 in 488, which is an extra 1. So, units place: 48 +1=49 times.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many such blocks are there? Again, considering up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears once per hundred. So, in 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. In 100-199: 180-189, 10. In 200-299: 280-289, 10. In 300-399: 380-389, 10. In 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, so that's 9 instead of 10. So, for the tens place, it's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. For the hundreds place up to 488, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the units, tens, and hundreds places for 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus one more in 488, so 49. Tens place: 10 per hundred for the first four hundreds, so 4*10=40, plus 9 in the last hundred (480-488), so 40+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't overcount.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48. Then from 481-488, page 484 has another 4, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48. Then 488 adds another 8, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks are 10 each, so 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So 40+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should separate the problem into looking at each digit place individually: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8, then compare the totals.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. For example, in 1-10, 4 is in 4, and 8 is in 8. This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 complete blocks, both 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. That's 48 times each. Then, in the partial block, which goes from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, they're equal in the units place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each (10-19 have tens digit 1, 20-29 have 2, etc.). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488. \n\nIn each complete hundred, both 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times each. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). Wait, no, actually, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, when the tens digit is 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. When the tens digit is 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nTherefore, total in the tens place: 4's are 4*10 + 10 = 50 times, and 8's are 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. So, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 1000 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nFrom 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't contribute any 4's or 8's. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's. Similarly, 200-299 has hundreds digit 2, 300-399 has 3, and 400-488 has 4. \n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 8, so 48 each, plus the last partial block (481-488) where 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred (1-100, etc.) has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 9 8's. So, total for tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. That adds up correctly.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8's don't appear in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nAdding up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 for 4's. For 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for the partial block. Let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 4's in the tens place. When the tens digit is 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place. So, that part is correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's count the total number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nUnits place: 488 pages. For units digit, each digit 0-9 appears equally, except maybe the last partial block. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 times 4 and 10 times 8. 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. For tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total tens: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: Only from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. No 8's. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about page numbers, sometimes the hundreds digit isn't printed. For example, page 1 is just '1', not '001'. So, does that affect the count? Hmm, in the problem statement, it says each page number is printed one time, so I think the page numbers are printed as they are, without leading zeros. So, page 1 is '1', page 10 is '10', page 100 is '100', etc. So, when considering the hundreds digit, only pages 100 and above have a hundreds digit. So, my earlier calculation for the hundreds place is correct because only pages 400-488 have a hundreds digit of 4, and none have 8.\n\nTherefore, I think my final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and a partial block of 8 pages (481-488).\n   - 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (400 pages) and a partial block (401-488).\n   - In the partial block, 4's appear 10 times (440-449), and 8's appear 9 times (480-488).\n   - 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50\n   - 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Only pages 400-488 have a hundreds digit of 4, contributing 89 4's.\n   - 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that when counting digits, it's helpful to separate the problem into units, tens, and hundreds places. So, I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the digit 4 appears once (at page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (at page 8). This pattern repeats every 10 pages. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 more pages. \n\nIn each complete set of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that's 48 times 1 for 4's and 48 times 1 for 8's. That gives me 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Now, for the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), I need to check the units digits. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in these last 8 pages, the digit 4 appears once (at 484), and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these, the total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49, and the 8's are 48 + 1 = 49 as well. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, with each digit from 0 to 9 appearing 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times, and 8 for pages 80-89, also 10 times. \n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10 for 4's and 4 times 10 for 8's, giving 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. \n\nWait, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nFor the digit 4 in the tens place, that occurs in pages 440-449. But wait, our range is 401-488, so 440-449 is entirely within this range. That's 10 pages, so 10 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. \n\nFor the digit 8 in the tens place, that occurs in pages 480-488. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this range. \n\nSo, adding this to our previous counts, the total 4's in the tens place are 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. The total 8's in the tens place are 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. \n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place only once in this range, which is 440-449, which is 10 times. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is included. So, yes, 10 for 4's and 9 for 8's in the tens place for the last partial hundred. \n\nSo, total in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 would have a hundreds digit of 4, but 488 is the last page. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). \n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times (from 400 to 488). The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0. \n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- Each 10 pages have one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488), so total units place: 48 +1=49 for 4's and 48 +1=49 for 8's. That's correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 each.\n- The remaining 88 pages (401-488) have the tens digit from 0 to 8.\n- For 4's in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 pages, so +10 for 4's.\n- For 8's in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 pages, so +9 for 8's.\n- So, 4's: 40 +10=50; 8's:40 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n- 8's: 0, since hundreds digit doesn't reach 8.\n- So, total 4's: 89; 8's:0.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those pages. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nAnother thing to check: when I considered the tens place in the last partial hundred (401-488), I considered 440-449 as 10 pages, which is correct, and 480-488 as 9 pages, which is correct because 488 is the last page. So, 9 8's in the tens place there. \n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other occurrences. For example, in the hundreds place, I only considered 400-488, which is correct because 1-399 have hundreds digits of 1, 2, or 3, so no 4's or 8's there except in the tens and units places. \n\nAlso, in the tens place, I considered each hundred block correctly, so I think the counts are accurate. \n\nSo, after carefully checking each step, I'm confident that the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have those counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll consider each digit position separately.\n\n1. **Units place**: The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, it's page 4; from 11 to 20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, since the book has 488 pages, the number of complete blocks of 10 is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 blocks with a remainder of 8. So, each block contributes 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, there's an extra 8 pages beyond the 480th page, so from 481 to 488, the units digit cycles through 1 to 8. Does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at 484. So that's one more occurrence. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers, from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, etc. So each 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds, with 88 remaining. So, for each hundred, 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (from 400 to 488), the tens digit is 0 to 8. Wait, no, actually, from 400 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So, does the tens digit ever hit 4 in this remaining part? Yes, from 440 to 449. That's another 10 occurrences. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so from 400 to 488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 440 to 449 is within that range, so that's 10 more. So total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So 4 appears 188 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 occurrences, plus in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), does 8 appear in the units place? Yes, at 488. So that's one more, so total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so from 480-488, the tens digit is 8. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So 9 more, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4 appears 188 times and 8 appears 98 times. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus in 481-488, 484 is the only one, so +1. Total 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10. Total 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus in 481-488, 488 is the only one, so +1. Total 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9. Total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.

After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, looking at the units place. For every set of ten pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, pages 4, 14, 24, etc. Since the book has 488 pages, the number of times 4 appears in the units place would be the number of complete groups of ten. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 times. Wait, but actually, the last group would be from 481 to 488, so 488 is included. So, the units digit 4 appears 48 times. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. So, the number of such numbers is floor(488/10) = 48, but wait, 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but actually, the last one is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, but 484 is the 48th, so that's correct. So, 48 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 pages. For example, from 40 to 49, that's 10 times, and similarly from 140 to 149, another 10 times, and so on. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). But wait, the next block would be 401-500, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is 401-488. So, in each of the first four blocks, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So that's 4 times 10, which is 40. But wait, in the last block, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. So, the tens digit 4 only appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, that's 40 times in the tens place. Wait, but actually, each block from 0-99, 100-199, etc., has exactly one set of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, for each hundred, 10 times. So, 488 is less than 500, so there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, 10 times. In 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens digit 4's: 5 times 10, which is 50? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0-99: 40-49 is 10 times. 100-199: 140-149 is 10 times. 200-299: 240-249 is 10 times. 300-399: 340-349 is 10 times. Then 400-488: 440-449 is 10 times. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 times. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 pages, but the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so yes, 10 times. So, total tens digit 4's: 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, but in reality, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The number of times the tens digit is 4 is determined by how many times 40-49, 140-149, etc., appear up to 488. So, for each hundred, there's one such block. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 pages). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, tens digit 4's: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, hundreds digit 4's: 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98+89=187.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Okay.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 4 appears in the units place, right? So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, let me check: the last page is 488, which ends with 8, so that would be the 48th occurrence. So, units digit 8's: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 0-99: 80-89 (10 pages). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the first four blocks, each contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens digit 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens digit 8's:49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds digit 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 187 and total 8's are 97. So, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 (since 488/10=48.8, so 48 times).\n- Tens: 50 (since there are 5 blocks where tens digit is 4, each contributing 10).\n- Hundreds:89 (from 400-488, which is 89 pages).\n\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:48 (same logic as 4's).\n- Tens:49 (4 full blocks contributing 10 each, and the last block contributing 9).\n- Hundreds:0.\n\nTotal 8's:48+49=97.\n\nDifference:187-97=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me recount. From 0-99:80-89 is 10. 100-199:180-189 is 10. 200-299:280-289 is 10. 300-399:380-389 is 10. 400-488:480-488 is 9. So, that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 0-99:40-49 (10), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), 400-488:440-449 (10). So, that's 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. That's correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 187, 8's are 97, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units digit for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many terms? Let's see: the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). We can set 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Wait, that's 49 terms. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, when I calculated units digit 8's, I thought it was 48 because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But according to the formula, the number of terms is 49. So, which is right?\n\nLet me list some numbers: 8 is the first, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many numbers is that? Let's see: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's 49 times. So, earlier I was wrong; it's 49, not 48. So, I made a mistake there.\n\nSo, that changes things. So, units digit 8's:49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place, let's check. From 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The last term is 484. So, using the same formula: 4 + 10(n-1)=484. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, n=49. Wait, so that would mean 49 times. But earlier I thought it was 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th term, because starting at 4 as the first term, then 14 is the second, ..., 484 would be the 49th term. Wait, let me check: 4 is term 1, 14 term 2, ..., 484 is term 49. So, 49 times. So, earlier I was wrong; both units digits for 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page. So, for 8's, the last term is 488, which is included. So, units digit 8's:49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's, the last term is 484, which is included, so units digit 4's:49.\n\nSo, that changes the total counts. So, let's recalculate.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188 - 98=90.\n\nWait, so the difference remains the same, 90, but the counts have changed because I corrected the units digit counts from 48 to 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. For 4's units digit: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. How many terms? (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nFor 8's units digit: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 48. So, the correct counts are:\n\n4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens digit for 8's again. Earlier, I thought it was 49, but let me confirm.\n\nFrom 0-99:80-89 is 10 pages.\n\n100-199:180-189 is 10.\n\n200-299:280-289 is 10.\n\n300-399:380-389 is 10.\n\n400-488:480-488 is 9 pages.\n\nSo, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, tens digit 8's:49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nTotal 4's:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, the units place: For every 10 pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From page 1 to 488, that's 488 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think it's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is exactly 48 full tens (480) plus 8 pages. So, from 1 to 480, the digit 4 appears 48 times in the units place, and then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So, units place: 48 times.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 pages. Specifically, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 pages mean we have four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. \n\nWait, no, actually, the hundreds blocks are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. So, does the tens digit 4 appear here? From 440-449, yes, that's another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from first four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place: 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only concerned with the digit 4 in the hundreds place. Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-499 would be 100 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, that's 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is exactly 48 full tens (480) plus 8 pages. So, from 1 to 480, the digit 8 appears 48 times in the units place, and then from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once more on page 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 pages, specifically in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (4 * 10 = 40) plus 9 from the last partial block, totaling 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8, right? Because 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 has 8, up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the units place for 8's. From 1 to 488, every 10 pages, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) include page 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, as I did earlier, it's 49 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place for 8's was 49, and the tens place was 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's was 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the tens place for 4's was 50, but let me check that again.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's: The blocks where the tens digit is 4 are:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5 * 10 = 50. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there were four full hundreds, but actually, from 1-400, it's four hundreds, and then 401-488 is the fifth partial hundred. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears once every 100 pages, so 4 times 10 = 40. Then, in the fifth partial hundred, 440-449 is another 10, making it 50. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, we have:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, 4 full blocks of 10, and the last one has 9, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again for 4's. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Wait, that's 49 times, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, let me list them: 4,14,24,...,484. The first term is 4, and the last term is 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but the last partial ten is 481-488, which includes 488, but 484 is within the 480-488 range. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence of 4 in the units place. So, that would mean 49 times, not 48. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I said units place for 4's was 48; it should actually be 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought from 1-480, it's 48 times, and then 481-488 doesn't add any more 4's in the units place because 484 is within 480-488, which is part of the 480-488 block. So, does that mean that from 1-480, it's 48 times, and then 481-488 includes 484, which is another 4 in the units place, making it 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 includes 484, which is 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 (from 1-480) +1 (from 484) = 49.\n\nSo, I think I made a mistake earlier by saying units place for 4's was 48; it's actually 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, from 1-480, it's 48 times, and then 481-488 includes 488, which is another 8 in the units place, making it 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, correcting the 4's count:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188. So, I need to adjust that.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total:98.\n\nSo, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me recount the units place for 4's.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The last term is 484, which is within 488. So, how many terms are there? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, units place for 4's:49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488. So, number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, tens place for 4's: As before, 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 89, but now it's 90. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me check the tens place for 8's again.\n\nTens place for 8's:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks of 10, and one block of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference:90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers. So, 488 - 400 +1=89. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. Let me check once more.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's:49 times.\n\nTens place for 4's:50 times.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nUnits place for 8's:49.\n\nTens place for 8's:49.\n\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place (1-488):**\n     - Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n     - Total units place occurrences: 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full cycles, but since 484 is included, it's 49 times.\n\n   - **Tens Place (1-488):**\n     - The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 pages: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n     - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place (1-488):**\n     - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n     - Number of such pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units Place (1-488):**\n     - Every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n     - Total units place occurrences: 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full cycles, plus one more at 488, totaling 49 times.\n\n   - **Tens Place (1-488):**\n     - The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 pages: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n     - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9 (480-488).\n     - Total tens place occurrences: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place (1-488):**\n     - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I can look at each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014and calculate how many times the digit appears in each place. So, for both 4 and 8, I'll need to calculate their occurrences in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place, and then sum them up. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1 through 0, each appearing once. Similarly, from 11 to 20, the units digits are 1 through 0 again. So, in each block of ten numbers, each digit (including 4 and 8) appears exactly once in the units place.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of ten and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once per block, so also 48 times. \n\nBut wait, in the last partial block (pages 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (at page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at page 488). So, adding that to the previous counts, the units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. Wait, but that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8. So, maybe I should check that again.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks (1-10, 11-20, ..., 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is 481-488). So, in the units place, for each complete block, 4 and 8 each appear once, so 48 times each. Then in the last block, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place total: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. Hmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, from 1-400, there are 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, what about the remaining 88 pages (401-488)? The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 480-488). Let me break this down:\n\n- From 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- From 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- ...\n- From 481-490: tens digit is 8, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 481-488.\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, 4 appears in the tens place in the 440-449 range. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 occurrences. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive, but 480 is included, so 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, in the remaining 88 pages:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (440-449)\n- 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, adding that to the previous counts:\n\nFor 4 in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 times\nFor 8 in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49 times\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these pages. So, 89 times.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, summing up for each digit place:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4 appears 188 times and 8 appears 98 times. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nEach block of 10 has one 4 and one 8. There are 48 complete blocks (1-480), so 48 each. Then, from 481-488, units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit for 4 is 10 times (440-449), and for 8, it's 9 times (480-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's separately and see if the totals make sense.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n- Total units place occurrences for 4 and 8: 48 full decades (48 occurrences each) + 1 in the last partial decade (pages 481-488).\n- Total: 49 each.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n- For 4: 400 pages contribute 40 occurrences, plus 10 in pages 440-449.\n- For 8: 400 pages contribute 40 occurrences, plus 9 in pages 480-488.\n- Total: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n- 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n- Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the totals for each digit, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages (481 to 488).\n\nIn each complete block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times 4's and 48 times 8's. But wait, the last partial block is from 481 to 488, which has 8 numbers. Let me check which of these have a 4 or 8 in the units place. The numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, in the partial block, there's one more 4 and one more 8. Therefore, for the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, 48 + 1 = 49. So, the units place doesn't contribute to a difference between 4's and 8's.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle of 100 has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.) and similarly 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8 (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). \n\nFirst, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (40-49) and 8 for 10 pages (80-89). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10 = 40 4's in the tens place and 4 times 10 = 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the partial hundred from 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 pages. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in the range 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 pages (480-488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. Wait, no, actually, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages here.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages and 8 for 9 pages. Therefore, the total for the tens place is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 8's. So, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's, which means 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The partial hundred is 401-488. The tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, the pages are 440-449, which is 10 pages. When the tens digit is 8, the pages are 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So yes, that's correct. So, the tens place contributes 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has the hundreds digit fixed. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the last hundred, from 401-488. \n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 401 to 488. So, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 = 88 pages, but since 401 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, it's from 401 to 488, which is 88 pages (since 488 - 400 = 88, but including both endpoints, it's 88 pages). Wait, actually, 401 to 488 is 88 pages because 488 - 401 + 1 = 88. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 88 pages. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. Therefore, in the hundreds place, there are 88 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, summing up the hundreds place, 88 4's and 0 8's, which is a difference of 88 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me add up the totals from each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place: 49 4's and 49 8's. So, difference is 0.\n\nTens place: 50 4's and 49 8's. So, difference is +1.\n\nHundreds place: 88 4's and 0 8's. So, difference is +88.\n\nAdding these differences together: 0 + 1 + 88 = 89.\n\nWait, so the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 88 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nAnd the total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. So, 48 each. Then, the last partial block (481-488) has 484 and 488, so one 4 and one 8. So, total 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, the partial hundred (401-488) has 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488). So, total 50 4's and 49 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 401-488, which is 88 pages, so 88 4's. No 8's in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 88 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 from page 401 to 488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 = 88, but since page 401 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, the count is 488 - 400 = 88 pages, but actually, it's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages? Wait, no, because 401 is the first page, so 488 - 400 = 88, but since both 401 and 488 are included, it's 88 pages. Wait, no, 488 - 401 + 1 = 88 pages. So, 88 pages with hundreds digit 4. So, 88 4's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 401 is the first page, and 488 is the last. So, the number of pages is 488 - 400 = 88, but since page 400 isn't included (it's page 401 that starts the hundreds digit 4), so it's 488 - 400 = 88 pages, but including both 401 and 488, so 88 pages. So, yes, 88 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 49 + 50 + 88 = 187.\n\nTotal 8's are 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about the hundreds place, I considered that from 401-488, which is 88 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 88 4's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the total number of 4's another way. Maybe by considering each digit position separately and adding them up.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 50.\n\nHundreds place: 88.\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 88 = 187.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 89.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place. Let me check that again.\n\nIn the tens place, each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens digit. So, 4 complete hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 pages, and 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 10 4's and 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For the tens digit, how many times does 4 appear? In each hundred, 10 times. So, 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: 4 hundreds give 40, and in the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the difference is 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to double-count or miss a range. Let me try another approach by calculating the total number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units place: As calculated, 49.\n- Tens place: 50.\n- Hundreds place: 88.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 88 = 187.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49.\n- Tens place: 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal: 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could write a small program or use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position, but since this is a manual calculation, I think the method I used is correct.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me check the hundreds place again. From 401 to 488, that's 88 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 88 4's. Correct.\n\nIn the units place, for each 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, that's 48 full tens and a partial ten of 8 pages. In the partial ten, 484 has a 4, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, each hundred has 10 4's in the tens digit. 4 hundreds give 40, plus 10 in the partial hundred, total 50.\n\nSame for 8's: units place has 49, tens place has 49, so total 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that when dealing with digit counting problems, it's helpful to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, maybe I should analyze how often the digits 4 and 8 appear in each of these places across all page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one. I'll need to calculate the number of times 4 appears in the units place, then in the tens place, and then in the hundreds place. I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can sum them up and find the difference between the total number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. \n\nBut wait, I also need to check the partial block from 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial block, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, so far, both digits appear equally in the units place.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers. So, in each 100-number block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). \n\nNow, how many complete 100-number blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 numbers (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 complete blocks, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. Now, in the partial block from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, from 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. Hmm, so I need to correct that.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit being 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For the tens digit being 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 489 would be beyond 488. So, in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nTherefore, in the tens place overall, 4's appear 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 = 50 times, and 8's appear 40 (from complete blocks) + 9 = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4's are more by 1.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is more straightforward. For page numbers from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so neither 4 nor 8 appears here. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so again, neither 4 nor 8. From 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; 400-488, it's 4. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from 400-488. How many times is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, from 800-899, the hundreds digit would be 8, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. Therefore, 4's are way more here, but let's keep going.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I made a mistake. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. But for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no page number in the 800s, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems quite a big difference.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 to both 4 and 8, so 48 each. Then, the last partial block from 481-488, which has 4 and 8 each once. So, 48 + 1 = 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 complete blocks (1-400) give 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449) and 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8. That looks correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8's in hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 +50 +89 = 188. 8's total:49 +49 +0=98. Difference: 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, okay, maybe that's correct. But let me think again. Another way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nWait, another way: for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 appears and subtract the number of times 8 appears. Then sum these differences.\n\nBut maybe I should just confirm the counts again.\n\nUnits place:\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing 1, and then in the last partial decade (481-488), 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 full decades give 48, and in the last partial decade, 488 has an 8. So, 48 +1=49. So, units place: 49 each, difference 0.\n\nTens place:\n- For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, same with 8. So, for 400-488, which is 89 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit being 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. \n\nWait, but earlier I considered 401-488, but actually, 400 is included as well. So, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nBut how many hundreds are there? From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds. Each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, the tens digit for 4 is 10 times (440-449) and for 8 is 9 times (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's:40 +9=49. So, difference in tens place: +1 for 4.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 appears 0 times. So, difference here is +89 for 4.\n\nSo, overall, the difference is 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to cross-verify. Maybe by considering each position and calculating how many times each digit appears.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 appears and subtract the number of times 8 appears. Then sum these differences.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Number of 4's: floor(488/10) + (if 488 mod 10 >=4, add 1 else 0). So, floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10=8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 49 4's.\n- Number of 8's: floor(488/10) + (if 488 mod 10 >=8, add 1 else 0). So, same as above, 48 +1=49.\n- Difference: 49-49=0.\n\nTens place:\n- Number of 4's: floor(488/100)*10 + extra for the partial hundred.\n- floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40.\n- Now, the partial hundred is 488 - 4*100=88. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? The tens digit cycles every 100. In the last partial hundred (0-88), the tens digits go from 0-8. So, 4 appears once in the tens place (40-49), but since we only go up to 88, it's 10 numbers (40-49). So, add 10.\n- Total 4's in tens place:40+10=50.\n- Similarly, number of 8's in tens place:\n- floor(488/100)*10=40.\n- In the partial hundred, the tens digit 8 appears from 80-88, which is 9 numbers (80-88 inclusive). So, add 9.\n- Total 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n- Difference:50-49=+1.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Number of 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since we're dealing with 3-digit numbers, it's the hundreds digit. So, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers.\n- So, 89 4's.\n- Number of 8's in hundreds place:0, since the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n- Difference:89-0=+89.\n\nAdding up the differences: units (0) + tens (+1) + hundreds (+89)=90.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. Therefore, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total units place occurrences:\n     - 4's: 48 (complete blocks) + 1 (partial block) = 49\n     - 8's: 48 (complete blocks) + 1 (partial block) = 49\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Total tens place occurrences:\n     - 4's: 40 (complete blocks) + 10 (partial block) = 50\n     - 8's: 40 (complete blocks) + 9 (partial block) = 49\n   - Difference: 50 - 49 = 1\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 times.\n   - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nSumming the differences: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let's start with the units place because that might be the simplest. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 pages. In each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times 1, which is 48 fours and 48 eights. \n\nThen, in the remaining 8 pages (from 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8. So, in the incomplete block, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. \n\nAdding that up, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from complete blocks) plus 1 (from the incomplete block) = 49. Similarly, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 plus 1 = 49. So, so far, it's equal in the units place.\n\nNext, I should check the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, right? Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (11-19), up to 9 (91-99). \n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and an additional 88 pages. \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights. \n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488), the tens digit goes through 0-9 for each ten. Let's break this down. From 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; 421-430, 2; 431-440, 3; 441-450, 4; 451-460, 5; 461-470, 6; 471-480, 7; and 481-488, the tens digit is 8. \n\nWait, let me count how many times each digit appears in the tens place in these 88 pages. \n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0 (10 times)\n- 411-420: 1 (10 times)\n- 421-430: 2 (10 times)\n- 431-440: 3 (10 times)\n- 441-450: 4 (10 times)\n- 451-460: 5 (10 times)\n- 461-470: 6 (10 times)\n- 471-480: 7 (10 times)\n- 481-488: 8 (8 times, since it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers)\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). \n\nSo, adding to the previous counts: fours in tens place are 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50. Eights in tens place are 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 = 48. \n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 fours and 48 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it only changes every 100 pages. So, from 1-99, there is no hundreds digit, so we can ignore that. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, 200-299 it's 2, 300-399 it's 3, and 400-488 it's 4. \n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place? \n\n- 100-199: 100 times the digit 1\n- 200-299: 100 times the digit 2\n- 300-399: 100 times the digit 3\n- 400-488: 89 times the digit 4 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times, and the digit 8 doesn't appear at all in the hundreds place because the hundreds digit only goes up to 4 in this book. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nAdding this up: fours in hundreds place are 89, and eights are 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit across all places.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 48\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- 48 complete blocks of 10: 48 fours and 48 eights\n- Incomplete block: 8 pages (481-488), so units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 + 1 = 49 eights. That seems right.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 complete hundreds: each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights, so 4*10=40 for each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8. From 441-450, tens digit is 4 (10 times). From 481-488, tens digit is 8, but only 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, tens: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 8 = 48 eights. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 numbers, so hundreds digit is 4, 89 times. No 8's in hundreds place.\n\nTotal fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, 188 minus 97 is indeed 91. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires comparing the number of times the digit '4' appears to the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **Complete Blocks:** 48 blocks of 10 pages each contribute 48 fours and 48 eights.\n   - **Incomplete Block (481-488):** Contains one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n   - **Total:** 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **Complete Hundreds:** 4 hundreds contribute 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - **Remaining Pages (401-488):** The tens digit '4' appears 10 times (441-450) and '8' appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 fours and 48 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **Pages 400-488:** The hundreds digit is '4' for 89 pages.\n   - **Total:** 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nSumming up:\n- **Total Fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **Total Eights:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's page 4; from 11-20, it's page 14; and so on. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each full group, there's one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group from 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a range of 10 numbers each time. For example, from 40-49, each page number has a 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there in 488 pages? Well, the first one is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's five ranges. Each range contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. \n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 pages, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. That's 50 4's in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every group of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups and 8 extra pages. Each full group contributes one 8, so 48. In the last partial group, 481-488, the units digit 8 is at page 488. So, that's one more, making it 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check: from 80-89, that's 10 pages, same for 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. So that's four ranges, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. \n\nWait, but wait a second: 80-89 is correct, but does 380-389 fall within 488? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So, four ranges, 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188 and total 8's are 89. The difference is 188 - 89 = 99.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then 484 is the 49th, so 49 total. That seems correct.\n- Tens: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five ranges, each 10 pages, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full groups, 48, plus 488, so 49. Correct.\n- Tens: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Four ranges, 4\u00d710=40. Correct.\n- Hundreds: None, since the book only goes up to 488. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 40 = 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99.\n\nWait, but let me think again: When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. But does page 400 count as the first page with a 4 in the hundreds place? Yes, because 400 is included. So, 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 4's, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine.\n\nFor 8's, the tens place goes up to 380-389, which is within 488, so that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct, so the difference is 99.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: Let me check the units place for 4's. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 471-480), each contributing one 4, so 48.

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up. \n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. So in each block of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once (like in 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (like in 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 more pages. So in each of these 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times in the units place. \n\nBut wait, there are 8 extra pages after 480 (since 48*10=480), so pages 481 to 488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So does the digit 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, in 484. Similarly, 8 appears in 488. So that's one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So they're equal in the units place. Hmm, interesting.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in 80-89, also 10 times.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of these 4 blocks, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10=40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each block, so 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see: from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; ... up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. \n\nSo in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in the 400s, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, then 1 for 411-420, up to 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers (481,482,...,488). But wait, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only have up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480 is included, but 480 is part of the 400s, right? Wait, no, 480 is part of the 400s, but 480 is the last page of the 400s? No, 400 is the start, 401 is next. Wait, actually, 400 is page 400, which is part of the 400s. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The tens digit in 401-488. So the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 is in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Well, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, right? Because 449 is less than 488. So that's 10 times. \n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but we only have up to 488, so that's 9 times (480-488). Wait, but 480 is included, so 480 is part of the 400s, right? Wait, no, 480 is part of the 400s, but in the tens place, 480 would have a tens digit of 8. Wait, 480 is 4-8-0, so yes, the tens digit is 8. So from 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo in the tens place, for the incomplete block, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, total tens place 4's are 4*10 (from the complete blocks) + 10 (from the incomplete block) = 50. Similarly, total tens place 8's are 4*10 (from the complete blocks) + 9 (from the incomplete block) = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. So in the complete blocks (1-400), each block has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 blocks would be 4*10=40 each. Then in the incomplete block (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8's in tens place are 9. So yes, 49 for 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So 0 times.\n\nSo now, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place counts. For 4's in the tens place: in the complete blocks (1-400), each block has 10 4's, so 4 blocks = 40. In the incomplete block (401-488), 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10. So total 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: in the complete blocks, 4 blocks, each with 10 8's, so 40. In the incomplete block, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9. So total 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I added up, I had 4's total as 188 and 8's as 98, so 188 - 98 = 90. But let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me check units place again.\n\nUnits place: Each block of 10 pages has one 4 and one 8. There are 48 complete blocks (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 blocks, each contributing 1 to 4's and 1 to 8's. So that's 48 each. Then the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4's: 50, 8's:49.\n\nHundreds place: 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 pages. So yes, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo yeah, I think that's correct. So the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. In the incomplete block (401-488), the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. And the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: For the hundreds place, 4's are 89, 8's are 0.\n\nFor the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 49.\n\nFor the units place, 4's are 49, 8's are 49.\n\nSo yes, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188 for 4's, and 0 + 49 + 49 = 98 for 8's.\n\nSo the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages), contributing 48 each.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's (e.g., 40-49) and 10 8's (e.g., 80-89).\n   - Four complete blocks (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 as the hundreds digit, appearing 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a particular digit appears in a range of numbers, it's often helpful to look at each digit place separately\u2014like units, tens, hundreds, etc. So maybe I should analyze how many times the digit 4 and 8 appear in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately, and then sum them up.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So for each of the 48 complete groups, both 4 and 8 appear 4 times each? Wait, no, actually, in each group of 10, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So for each group, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. Therefore, for 48 groups, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nBut wait, there are 8 extra numbers beyond the 480th page. These are pages 481 to 488. So in the units place, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in these extra 8 numbers, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So adding that to the previous counts, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, so in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times? Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 numbers, and each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So let's see. The book goes up to 488, so we have 100s, 200s, 300s, and 400s. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So in the 100s (1-100), the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 times. The same applies to the 200s, 300s, and 400s. So for each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. \n\nBut wait, in the 400s, the page numbers go up to 488, so the tens digit goes up to 8. Let me check that. From 400 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So for the tens place in the 400s, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, no, actually, 480 to 489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So in the tens place for the 400s, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nLet me summarize that. For the 100s, 200s, and 300s, each has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. But for the 400s, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So total for the tens place: 4 appears 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 10 (400s) = 40 times. 8 appears 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 9 (400s) = 39 times. So in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times, and 8 appears 39 times. So 4 is ahead by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, and 4 for 300-399, but wait, no, wait. Wait, 300-399 would have hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 would have hundreds digit 4. So let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 only for pages 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. So 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit across all places.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 40 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 40 + 89 = 178 times.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 39 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 39 + 0 = 88 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 178 - 88 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8.\n- 48 * 1 = 48 for each.\n- Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So units total: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and same for 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- For each hundred (100s, 200s, 300s), the tens digit cycles 0-9, so 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n- So 100s: 10 each, 200s: 10 each, 300s: 10 each.\n- For 400s, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, so 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times), and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page.\n- So 4: 10 each in 100s, 200s, 300s, and 10 in 400s: total 40.\n- 8: 10 each in 100s, 200s, 300s, and 9 in 400s: total 39. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So 0 times. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88\n- Difference: 178 - 88 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those 89 pages. So yes, 89 times. And 8 never appears in the hundreds place, correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place in the 400s again. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So how many numbers is that? 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for the 400s. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So units place counts are correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So the total number of 4's is 178, and the total number of 8's is 88, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 pages mean 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - For each hundred (100s, 200s, 300s), 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n   - In the 400s, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 10 (400s) = 40\n   - Total 8's: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 9 (400s) = 39\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88\n\n**Difference:** 178 - 88 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Once I have those totals, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's consider each digit place separately.\n\n1. **Units place**: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, does the 488 include a 4 in the units place? 488 is 488, so the last number with a 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within 488. So, 48 times 1 is 48. But wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that mean the units digit goes up to 8? So, 488 is 488, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is indeed within 488. So, 48 times. Hmm, but wait, 488 is 488, so 488 is 488, so the units digit goes up to 8, but 484 is 484, which is page 484, so yes, that's correct. So, 48 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40 to 49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140 to 149, and from 240 to 249, and from 340 to 349, and from 440 to 449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block would be 440 to 449. Let me check that. So, how many such blocks are there? Each block is 100 numbers apart. So, starting from 40-49, that's one block, then 140-149, another, 240-249, another, 340-349, another, and 440-449, which is the fifth block. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks times 10 is 50. But wait, does the 440-449 block go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48 times, tens place: 50 times, hundreds place: 89 times. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to the 4's, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. The last 8 in the units place is 488, which is included, so that's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that mean the units digit goes up to 8, so yes, 488 is included. So, 48 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place**: For the tens place, 8 appears in blocks of 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place, except the last one, which might be cut short.\n\nLet me calculate this carefully. The blocks are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 180-189: another 10 times.\n- 280-289: another 10 times.\n- 380-389: another 10 times.\n- 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97 times.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Units place: 48, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears 187 times, and the digit 8 appears 97 times. The question is asking how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract 97 from 187.\n\n187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 48 + 49 = 97. Correct.\n\nSo, 187 - 97 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. When I calculated the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 each, so 40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to calculate the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is to consider how many full hundreds are there, and then the partial one.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does the tens digit cycle through 0-9? Well, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 10 times. So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). So, 4 complete hundreds contribute 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That matches what I had before.\n\nSimilarly, for the units digit, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, plus the last one at 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, so that's 48 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 is 488, so the units digit is 8, so that's included in the count. So, 48 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is 488, so the units digit 8 appears at 8, 18, ..., 488. How many terms are there in this sequence? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 8, ending at 488, with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, that's 49 times. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nHold on, earlier I thought it was 48 times, but using this formula, it's 49 times. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me recast it. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. But in the last partial group, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 is included as 488. So, that's one more 8. So, total is 48 +1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but actually, it's 49. That changes things.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's use the same approach.\n\nThe units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4. Then, in the last partial group, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is included, which is 4 in the units place. So, that's one more 4. So, total is 48 +1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, so earlier I had 48 for both 4 and 8 in the units place, but actually, it's 49 for both.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. For 8's in the units place, from 1 to 488, the numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms that is. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, 8 +10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u226448 \u2192 n \u226449. So, 49 terms.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place, numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488. So, 4 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u219210(n-1) \u2264484 \u2192n-1 \u226448.4 \u2192n \u226449.4, so n=49.\n\nSo, both 4 and 8 in the units place appear 49 times each.\n\nWait, so earlier I had 48 for both, but that was incorrect. It's actually 49 for both.\n\nSo, let's correct that.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: Let's see, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10. So, 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total for 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nWait, 49+50=99, plus 89=188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place: Let's recalculate. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place:0\n\nSo, total for 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, so 4's:188, 8's:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 187-97=90, but now it's 188-98=90. So, same result, but the counts are slightly different because I corrected the units place counts from 48 to 49 for both digits.\n\nSo, the difference remains 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me recount.\n\nFor the tens place of 8's:\n\n- 80-89:10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place:\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? 440,441,...,449. So, that's 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nSo, yes, 50 for 4's in the tens place.\n\nAnd hundreds place for 4's is 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nSo, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89. So, yes, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for the 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s, so hundreds place for 8's is 0.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, final answer: 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe digit 4 appears 188 times, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Now, we need to check if 440-449 is within the 488-page limit. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So total 4's in the tens place are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 4's from each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So there are 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so that's 48. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once here. So total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers, specifically from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges except the last one has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. The first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10=40. Now, for 480-488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So that's 9 more. So total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0 8's here.\n\nAdding up the 8's from each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So there are 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98. That also looks correct.\n\nSo 187 - 98 = 89. So there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers have one '4'. There are 48 complete groups of 10 (1-480), contributing 48 '4's. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any '4's in the units place. Total: 48.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in the tens place for ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 '4's.\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place, contributing 89 '4's.\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4's, there are 49 '8's in the units place.\n   - **Tens place:** '8's appear in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 '8's.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** There are 89 more '4's than '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of times 4 appears. I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such groups are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then a partial group from 481 to 488. But wait, actually, 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 (from 1-480) plus one more in 484, which is 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. \n\nActually, for each set of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full tens and then 8 more numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from each full ten) plus 1 if 484 is within the range. Since 484 is less than 488, it's included, so that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 484 is in the 480-488 range, so yes, it adds one more 4 in the units place. So, units place: 49 times.\n\nNow, the tens place: Similarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds and then a partial hundred from 400-488. \n\nEach full hundred (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has exactly 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (from 40-49). So, 4 full hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, the partial hundred is from 400-488. In this range, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10 times. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 times in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 more. So, tens place: 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. \n\nSo, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, I need to do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through each place again.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1-488, there are 48 full tens and then 8 more numbers. So, 48 times from the full tens. Now, in the partial group 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 is included once. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many such blocks are in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each full hundred contributes 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 9 more times. So, total tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nAdding up units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times the digit 8 appears.\n\nNow, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full tens (1-480) gives 48, plus 484, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds (1-400) gives 40, plus 400-488 gives 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full tens, plus 488, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds give 40, plus 480-488 gives 9, so 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such sets are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, plus one more time in the 480-488 range, making it 49 times. Wait, no, actually, in the 480-488 range, the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so 484 is the only number where the units digit is 4. So that's one more, so 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see, from 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So in 1-100, there's 40-49, which is one block. Then 140-149, another block, and so on. How many hundreds are there? 488 is less than 500, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so let me think.\n\nWait, actually, each hundred has one block where the tens digit is 4. So from 1-100, 40-49 is one block. Then 100-200, 140-149 is another. 200-300, 240-249. 300-400, 340-349. And then 400-488, which would be 440-449. So that's five blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 400-488, the tens digit 4 runs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, that's correct. So 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? Let's calculate 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the places for 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let's calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So the digit 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in every block of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Plus, in the last partial block, 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once (at 488). So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are from 1 to 488.\n\nIn 1-100: 80-89 is one block, contributing 10 times.\n101-200: 180-189, another 10 times.\n201-300: 280-289, another 10 times.\n301-400: 380-389, another 10 times.\n401-488: Now, 480-488 is the next block, but does 480-488 include the tens digit 8? Yes, 480-488 has 480-488, so the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. But how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, but earlier blocks each had 10 numbers, so let me count:\n\n1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 times\n101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 times\n201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 times\n301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 times\n401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 times\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. So 0 times.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 49, so 98 total 8's.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and 8's are 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, counting 4's:\n\nUnits place: For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 4 appears at 484. So that's one more, making it 49 times. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100. So from 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 times.\n101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 times.\n201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 times.\n301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 times.\n401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 times. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times. So 50 times in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So 89 times in the hundreds place. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: Same as 4's, 49 times.\n\nTens place: Let's recount. From 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 times.\n101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 times.\n201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 times.\n301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 times.\n401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 times (since 488 is the last page). So 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 0 times, as there are no pages beyond 488.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let's think about how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit: For both 4 and 8, in 488 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears roughly 48 or 49 times. Since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 49 times for each digit in the units place, except maybe some adjustment. Wait, but for 4's, we had 49, and for 8's, we also had 49. That seems consistent.\n\nFor tens digit: Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So in 488 numbers, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 times per digit in the tens place. So 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-8. So for each digit 0-8, how many times does it appear in the tens place? From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). For each tens digit d (0-8), there are 10 numbers except for d=8, which has 9 numbers (480-488). So for digit 8 in the tens place, it's 9 times. So total tens digit 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 (from the full hundreds) + 9 (from the partial hundred) = 49 times. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 4 in the tens place, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So in the partial hundred, 10 times, plus in the full hundreds, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, so total 50 times. That's correct.\n\nFor hundreds digit: Only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times for 4. No 8's in hundreds place.\n\nSo, yeah, the counts seem correct. So 188 4's and 98 8's, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach to make sure. Maybe using a formula or another counting method.\n\nAnother way to count digit occurrences is to calculate for each digit position separately, as I did, but perhaps using a more systematic approach.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is given by:\n\nfloor(N / 10) + (1 if the units digit of N >= d else 0)\n\nWait, but for d=4 and N=488:\n\nfloor(488 / 10) = 48, and since 488's units digit is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly for d=8:\n\nfloor(488 / 10) = 48, and since 8 <=8, add 1, so 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nThe formula is a bit more involved. The number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N is:\n\nLet higher = N / 100 (integer division)\nLet current = (N / 10) % 10\nLet lower = N % 10\n\nIf current > d: count = (higher + 1) * 10\nIf current == d: count = higher * 10 + lower + 1\nIf current < d: count = higher * 10\n\nBut we have to adjust for d=0, but since we're dealing with digits 4 and 8, which are non-zero, maybe this formula works.\n\nLet me apply this to d=4 in the tens place for N=488.\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 = 4\ncurrent = (488 // 10) % 10 = 48 % 10 = 8\nlower = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSince current (8) > d (4), count = (4 + 1) * 10 = 5 * 10 = 50. Which matches our earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in the tens place:\n\nhigher = 4\ncurrent = 8\nlower =8\n\nSince current (8) == d (8), count = 4 * 10 + 8 + 1 = 40 + 8 +1=49. Which is correct.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nFor d=4 in the hundreds place:\n\nhigher = 488 // 1000 = 0\ncurrent = (488 // 100) % 10 = 4 %10=4\nlower = 488 % 100 =88\n\nSince current (4) >= d (4), count = (0 + 1) * 100 = 100, but since N=488, we have to adjust. Wait, actually, the formula might be different.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to consider how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Which is correct.\n\nFor d=8 in hundreds place, since 488 < 800, it's zero.\n\nSo using these formulas, we get the same counts as before, so I'm confident that the counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me just think if there's any overlap or something I missed. For example, numbers like 444 have multiple 4's, but I think I've counted each occurrence separately, so that's fine. Similarly, 488 has two 8's, but I think I've counted each occurrence in each digit place, so that's correct.\n\nYes, I think I've covered all cases. So the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and one partial block (481-488). The digit 4 appears once in the units place in each full block (48 times) and once in the partial block (484), totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every block of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149). There are 5 such blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488), contributing 10 times each, totaling 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once in every block of 10. There are 48 full blocks and one partial block (481-488), contributing 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every block of 100, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189). There are 4 full blocks and a partial block (480-488), contributing 10 times each for the first four blocks and 9 times for the last partial block, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s, so 0 times.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 times.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8 in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll consider each place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, it's 4; from 11 to 20, it's 14; and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, I can calculate how many full sets of 10 there are and then see if there's a partial set at the end.\n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. That means there are 48 full sets of 10 and an extra 8 pages. In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, each set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101 to 200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on.\n\nLet me see how many full hundreds there are in 488. Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. Each full hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. In these, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on. Wait, actually, 401-488: the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, 2 in 421-430, 3 in 431-440, 4 in 441-450, 5 in 451-460, 6 in 461-470, 7 in 471-480, and 8 in 481-490, but wait, we only go up to 488. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, but since 488 is less than 490, it's actually 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. From 1-400, how many 4's in the tens place? Each hundred block contributes 10, so 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each have 10, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, ..., up to 8 in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages. So yes, that's 10 more, making it 50 total. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only for pages 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's are units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, for every 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Each set of 100 contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times here. So, total tens 8's are 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 481-490, but since we only have up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, 8 8's in the tens place. So, total tens 8's are 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0.\n\nTherefore, total 8's are units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-400, each hundred block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so that's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, 8 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 8 = 48. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 97. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Then, units and tens as calculated. So, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. That seems right.\n\nAnd for 8's, units are 49, tens are 48, so 97 total. So, 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. From 1-400, each hundred block has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, making it 50. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, from 1-400, 4*10=40 in the tens place, and from 401-488, 8 more in 481-488, so 48 total.\n\nOkay, so I think the calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 pages contribute one '4' in the units place.\n   - Total full sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more '4' (at 484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 '4's in the tens place.\n   - Four hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Pages 401-488 add another 10 '4's (441-450).\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 '4's.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 pages contribute one '8' in the units place.\n   - Total full sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more '8' (at 488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - Four hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 8 '8's in the tens place (481-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have an '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **97**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = **91**.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4), and 8 appears once (page 8). \n\nNow, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). In each of the 48 full groups, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). \n\nAdding those up, the units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. Wait, that means in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times. So, no difference there. Hmm, maybe I need to check the tens place next.\n\nIn the tens place, things change a bit. The tens digit changes every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 40-49. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89. \n\nBut wait, our book only goes up to 488 pages, so I need to adjust for that. Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. From 1-400, the tens digit cycles 4 times (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Each of these contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, what about the pages from 401-488? The tens digit here ranges from 0-8, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit goes up to 8. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 pages. Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place would be from 480-488, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, from 480-488, that's 9 pages, right? Because 480-489 would be 10 pages, but we stop at 488, so it's 9 pages. \n\nWait, no, actually, let me correct that. The tens digit in 480-488 is 8, so the digit 8 appears in the tens place for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. But wait, 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the 400s. \n\nSo, adding that up, the digit 4 appears 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times in the tens place. The digit 8 appears 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times in the tens place. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. That means the tens place contributes 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles through 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. So, 8 would appear in the hundreds place for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. Therefore, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place in this book. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding that up, the hundreds place contributes 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the contributions from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 times for 4, 49 times for 8 \u2192 difference is 0\n- Tens place: 50 times for 4, 49 times for 8 \u2192 difference is +1\n- Hundreds place: 89 times for 4, 0 times for 8 \u2192 difference is +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal number of units digits from 1-488: Each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place except possibly the last partial group. \n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). Each group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 * 1 = 48 for each digit. Then, the last partial group is pages 481-488, which are 8 pages. The units digits here are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. So, that's correct, difference is 0.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, each tens digit 0-9 appears 40 times each (since 400 / 100 = 4, and each hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place). So, 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 40 times.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles again. Let's break this down:\n\n- Pages 401-409: tens digit is 0\n- 410-419: tens digit is 1\n- 420-429: tens digit is 2\n- 430-439: tens digit is 3\n- 440-449: tens digit is 4 (10 pages)\n- 450-459: tens digit is 5\n- 460-469: tens digit is 6\n- 470-479: tens digit is 7\n- 480-488: tens digit is 8 (9 pages, since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, in the 400s, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (440-449), and the digit 8 appears for 9 pages (480-488). Therefore, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, the difference here is indeed +1 for 4.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages. So, difference here is +89.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the hundreds place really 89 times? Let me count:\n\nFrom 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nThe total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, and the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 10 vs 9, which is a difference of +1. So, yes, that adds up.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. That seems right.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the parts, so I'm confident the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages in the units place.\n   - Total complete groups of 10 pages: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Each group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place: 48 times each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) contribute one more 4 (page 484) and one more 8 (page 488).\n   - **Total for units place:** 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 10 times every 100 pages in the tens place.\n   - From pages 1-400: 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - From pages 401-488:\n     - Fours in tens place: 10 times (440-449).\n     - Eights in tens place: 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total for tens place:** 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - **Total for hundreds place:** 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\n4. **Calculating the Total Counts:**\n   - **Total fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Finding the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Total fours - Total eights = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense. \n\nLet me start by figuring out how many times each digit appears in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. Since we're dealing with numbers up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. The tens digit can be 0 through 9, and the units digit can be 0 through 9 as well. \n\nWait, but since 488 is less than 500, the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, I'll need to handle the hundreds place differently for numbers 400 to 488 compared to 1 to 399. \n\nLet me tackle each digit position separately, starting with the units place. For the units digit, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? \n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages. So, in each block, 4 appears once in the units place. That would be 48 times. But wait, does the last partial block (481-488) include another 4 in the units place? Let me check. The units digits go from 1 to 8 in the last block, so 484 is within that range, so that's one more. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49 times. \n\nSimilarly, for the units digit 8's: in every block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks and 8 extra pages. Each block contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. The last partial block has 88, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8, so that's another one. So total units place 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49 times. \n\nWait, so for units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each? Hmm, that's interesting. So, so far, units place doesn't contribute to the difference. Let me move on to the tens place. \n\nIn the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, every block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 440-449. Let me count how many such blocks there are. \n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, the first block is 1-100, then 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500. But since we stop at 488, the last block is 401-488. \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, how many full hundreds do we have? 400 pages would be four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 instances where the tens digit is 4. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond that. Wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 times. So total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50 times. \n\nWait, but let me check: from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, that's 10 more. So total 50 times. \n\nNow, for the tens place 8's: how many times does 8 appear in the tens digit? Similarly, in each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. \n\nSo, in each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), we have 10 instances where the tens digit is 8. There are four full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nIn the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 times. \n\nSo total tens place 8's would be 40 + 9 = 49 times. \n\nWait, so for tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, that's a difference of 1 more 4 in the tens place. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds digit? Well, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times and 8's appear 0 times. \n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit. \n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 4's: 48 full decades (1-480) give 48, plus 484 in the last 8 pages, so 49.\n- 8's: 48 full decades give 48, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40, plus 440-449 in the last partial hundred, which is 10, so total 50.\n- 8's: 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40, plus 480-488, which is 9, so 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n- 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place for 4's. In every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, it's 4; from 11 to 20, it's 14; and so on. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10, and then an extra 8 numbers (481 to 488). In each of those 48 blocks, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block, from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place for 4's. In each block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the numbers are 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. \n\nLet me calculate how many full hundreds there are in 488. There are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? Let's calculate 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add them up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place for 8's. Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the units digit 8 appears once. From 1-10: 8; 11-20: 18; and so on. So, how many full blocks of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks. Each contributes 1, so 48 times. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8's. In each block of 100, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. For example, 80-89 in the first hundred, 180-189 in the second, and so on. \n\nHow many full hundreds are there? Four: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 10. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8's. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because 4's were 188 and 8's are 98, which would mean 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's. But let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, when I calculated the tens place for 4's, I had 50, which came from 40 (from the first four hundreds) plus 10 from 440-449. But 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 for tens place 4's.\n\nFor 8's, the tens place in the last block was 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49 for tens place 8's.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place for 4's, I had 89, which is correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. For 4's, units place: 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial block from 481-488, which includes 484, so that's 1 more, making 49.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial block from 481-488, which includes 488, so that's 1 more, making 49.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 4's, I had 50, which is correct because in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times, adding to the 40 from the first four blocks, making 50.\n\nFor 8's, in the last block, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like I might have missed something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 8's, I had 40 from the first four blocks (1-400), and then 9 from 480-488, making 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the units place for 8's again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and then the 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers, so 4 times 10 is 40, and then in the last 88 numbers (401-488), 8 appears in the tens place 9 times (480-488), so 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 numbers, so 9 times the tens digit 8. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's: 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, and the last partial cycle contributes 1 (since 484 is within 481-488). So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, and the last partial cycle contributes 1 (488). So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as there are no page numbers 800-899.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a way to cross-verify this? Maybe by considering the total number of digits or something else, but I think the method is sound.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small program or use a different approach, but since I'm doing this manually, I think the calculations are correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 4.\n   - Total blocks: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Partial block (481-488) contributes 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total blocks: 4 (1-400).\n   - Last block (401-488) contributes 10 occurrences (440-449).\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 8.\n   - Total blocks: 48.\n   - Partial block (481-488) contributes 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total blocks: 4.\n   - Last block (401-488) contributes 9 occurrences (480-488).\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
