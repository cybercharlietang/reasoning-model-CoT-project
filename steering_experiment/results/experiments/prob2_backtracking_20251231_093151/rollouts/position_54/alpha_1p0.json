So, the number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, it's the number of 4's minus the number of 8's. That would be 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's the answer. But let me just make sure I didn't overcount anywhere. For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. That seems right because 488 - 400 +1 =89. For the tens place, 4 in the tens digit occurs in 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Units place: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 49 numbers. That adds up. For eights, units place: 8 to 488, stepping by 10, which is 49. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set has only 9 numbers, so total 49. So, 49+49=98. So, yes, 188-98=90.

This occurs every 10 numbers, starting at 4 and ending at 484. The count is calculated as:\n     - (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 480 / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit from the right):** '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit from the right):** '4' appears in numbers from 400 to 488. The count is:\n     - 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** '8' appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This occurs every 10 numbers, starting at 8 and ending at 488.

    "text": " Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights are 49+49=98. Yes, that's correct. So, the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98. Now, the question is how many more fours are there than eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. When I considered the tens digit being 8, I included 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct.

This sequence has 49 terms.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd Digit):** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd Digit):** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   \n   Total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
