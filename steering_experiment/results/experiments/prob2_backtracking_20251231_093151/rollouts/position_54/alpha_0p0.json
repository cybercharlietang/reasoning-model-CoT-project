So, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. When I counted the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 10+10+10+10+9=49, which seems right because 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place was 49, so total eights:98. Fours:188, so 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

    "text": " Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place, I had 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm that. 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 -480 +1 =9. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that last set. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about the hundreds place for fours, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours there. And for eights, in the hundreds place, there are none. So, that seems right. Let me just check the tens place for eights again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, then 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. So, 98 eights. Fours: 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds. 49+50=99, +89=188. So, 188-98=90.

The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.

How many terms? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488.
