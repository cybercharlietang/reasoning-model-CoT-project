    "text": " I need to solve this step by step. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I know that each page is numbered from 1 to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit '8' appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nTo approach this, I think I should break it down by the places where the digits can appear: units place, tens place, hundreds place. Since 488 is a three-digit number, the page numbers go up to three digits, so I need to consider each digit position separately.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's in each position.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit '4' appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - To find out how many times '4' appears in the units place from 1 to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full blocks of 10, and then check the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488).\n   - In each block of 10, there's one '4' in the units place, so 48 blocks give 48 '4's.\n   - Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, there's one more '4' in the units place here.\n   - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 numbers. For each block of 100, the digit '4' appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - So, for each 100 numbers, there are 10 '4's in the tens place.\n   - Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n   - So, in each of the 4 full hundreds, there are 10 '4's in the tens place, giving 4 * 10 = 40 '4's.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), I need to check how many times '4' appears in the tens place.\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100, so from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). Wait, no, actually, 401-410 would have tens digit 0, 411-420 tens digit 1, and so on up to 481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, the last block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers with tens digit 8.\n   - The '4' in the tens place occurs in the block 440-449. Let's see, from 401-488, how many full blocks of 10 are there where the tens digit is 4? It's only one block: 440-449.\n   - So, in this block, there are 10 '4's in the tens place.\n   - Therefore, total '4's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '4' for all page numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - So, the digit '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the '4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal '4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, for the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a '4' in the hundreds place, so that's correct. \n\nIn the tens place, I considered 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 '4's, so 40, and then in the remaining 88 pages, the block 440-449 adds another 10, so 50 total. That seems right.\n\nIn the units place, 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one '4', so 48, and then in the last 8 pages, 481-488, the units digit '4' appears once, so 49. That adds up.\n\nSo total '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, but wait a second, when I count the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a '4' in the hundreds place, so 89 '4's. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of '8's in each position.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to '4's, in every block of 10, there's one '8' in the units place.\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks, each contributing one '8', so 48 '8's.\n   - Now, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so the last number is 488, which has an '8' in the units place.\n   - So, in the remaining 8, there's one '8' in the units place (488).\n   - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is '8' in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - For each 100 numbers, there are 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds in 488, so 4 * 10 = 40 '8's.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), we need to check how many times '8' appears in the tens place.\n   - The blocks where tens digit is '8' would be 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive).\n   - So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Wait, but 480-489 is a block of 10, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is '8' for 9 numbers.\n   - Therefore, total '8's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '8' only in page numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches '8'.\n   - So, '8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nAdding up all the '8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal '8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me verify:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks of 10, each with one '8', so 48. Plus, in 481-488, the units digit '8' appears once at 488, so 49 total.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 '8's, so 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is '8' in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 '8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more '4's are printed than '8's. So, subtract the number of '8's from the number of '4's.\n\nNumber of '4's: 188\nNumber of '8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my counts again, because 90 seems high, and I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount the '4's.\n\n**Recounting '4's:**\n\n1. Units place:\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks, each contributing one '4' in units place: 48.\n   - The last partial block is 481-488, which includes 484, so units digit '4' appears once: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - Each hundred has 10 '4's in the tens place: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit '4' appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a '4' in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\n**Recounting '8's:**\n\n1. Units place:\n   - 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks, each with one '8': 48.\n   - Last partial block 481-488 includes 488, so units digit '8' once: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - Each hundred has 10 '8's in tens place: 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit '8' appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - No '8's since the book ends at 488: 0.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 '4's - 98 '8's = 90.\n\nWait, but 90 seems like a big difference. Let me think if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, another way to check: Maybe I overcounted the '4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, but since both ends are included, it's 89. So, 89 '4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for '4's. Let me see: In the tens place, each hundred has 10 '4's, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit '4' occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, totaling 50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's, in the tens place, each hundred has 10 '8's, so 40, and then in the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, totaling 49.\n\nHmm, perhaps 90 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting the hundreds place for '4's. Wait, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? Let me calculate:\n\n488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 numbers, each contributing a '4' in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, another thought: When counting the units and tens places, did I include numbers beyond 488? For example, when I counted the units place for '4's, I considered up to 488, so that's correct. Similarly for '8's.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check with a smaller example to see if my method works.\n\nLet's take a 10-page book. How many '1's and '0's are there?\n\nPages 1-10.\n\nCounting '1's:\n\n- Units place: 1,11 (but 11 is beyond 10, so only 1 once.\n- Tens place: 10-19, but in 10, the tens digit is '1', so 1 '1' in tens place.\n- Hundreds place: none.\nTotal '1's: 2.\n\nCounting '0's:\n\n- Units place: none, since pages start at 1.\n- Tens place: 10 has a '0' in units place, but wait, 10 is '10', so units digit is '0', so that's one '0'.\n- Hundreds place: none.\nTotal '0's: 1.\n\nDifference: 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nFor '1's:\n\nUnits place: 10/10 = 1 block, so 1 '1' in units place. Since 10 is included, but units digit '1' is only at 1. So, 1.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 '1's in tens place, but in 10 pages, it's just the block 10-19, but we only have up to 10. So, in tens place, '1' appears once (at 10). So, 1.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal '1's: 1 + 1 + 0 = 2. Correct.\n\nFor '0's:\n\nUnits place: 10/10 = 1 block, but units digit '0' only at 10, so 1.\n\nTens place: 0, since in 1-10, the tens digit is '0' only for 1-9, but '0' isn't counted as a digit in the tens place for numbers less than 10. Wait, actually, in page numbers, 1-9 are single-digit, so their tens digit is '0' implicitly, but we don't count leading zeros. So, in reality, the tens digit is '0' only for 10, but in 10, the tens digit is '1', so actually, '0's in tens place: 0.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier count. So, perhaps in the tens place, '0's don't count because they're leading zeros, which aren't printed. So, in 1-9, the tens digit isn't printed as '0', so '0's in the tens place: 0.\n\nSimilarly, units digit '0' appears once at page 10.\n\nSo, total '0's: 1.\n\nThus, difference is 2 - 1 = 1, which is correct.\n\nSo, my method seems to work for this small example.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another way to check: Maybe I should calculate the total number of '4's and '8's using another approach, such as considering each digit place separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for '4's. Let me recount:\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that?\n\n488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a '4' in the hundreds place. So, 89 '4's. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place for '4's, each hundred contributes 10 '4's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds contribute 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit '4' occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nIn the units place, 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one '4', so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digit '4' occurs once at 484. So, 49.\n\nTotal '4's: 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. Wait, no, that's 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because 89 + 50 is 139, plus 49 is 188. Yes, that's correct.\n\nFor '8's:\n\nIn the units place, 48 full blocks, each contributing one '8', so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digit '8' occurs once at 488, so 49.\n\nIn the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 '8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 '8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more '4's than '8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more '4's than '8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 '4's.\n   - **Tens place:** 50 '4's.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 '4's.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 '8's.\n   - **Tens place:** 49 '8's.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 '8's.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to understand how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 also appears once. \n\nTo find out how many times each digit appears in the units place, I can divide the total number of pages by 10. Since there are 488 pages, that's 488 divided by 10, which is 48 full groups of 10, with 8 pages remaining. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, and the digit 8 also appears 48 times. But wait, the last partial group is from 481 to 488. In this partial group, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 8 appears once more in the units place. Therefore, the total for 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, units place: 4's = 48, 8's = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every group of 100 pages, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each block of 10. So, in each group of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and the same for 8 (e.g., 80-89). \n\nNow, how many full groups of 100 are there in 488 pages? That's 4 full groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then the remaining 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full group of 100, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 full groups, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. \n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. \n\nWait, but actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. \n\nSo, adding this to the previous total, the tens place for 4's is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8's, it's 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. For the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, there are 10 numbers except when we reach the end. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 10 times for 4 and 9 times for 8 in the tens place for the partial group. So, total in the tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me correct that. The full groups of 100 contribute 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4 groups give 4*10=40 for each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total in the tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but that would mean that in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place: The hundreds digit in a 3-digit number. For numbers 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so we can ignore that. From 100 onwards, the hundreds digit changes. \n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, from 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. It never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check each part.\n\nUnits place:\n- 488 pages, so 48 full decades, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight. So, 48 fours, 48 eights.\n- The last partial decade is 481-488, which has 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1-8, so 8 appears once more, making 49 eights. Fours don't appear here because the units digits are 1-8, so fours in units place remain at 48. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each full hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 each.\n- The remaining 88 pages (401-488) have tens digits from 0 to 8. The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, 40+10=50 fours, 40+9=49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours. No eights in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n- 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full groups, contributing 48 each.\n- The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 8.\n- **Total 4's:** 48\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each group of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 full groups, contributing 40 each.\n- The remaining 88 pages (401-488) have 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n- **Total 4's:** 40 + 10 = 50\n- **Total 8's:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, contributing 89 4's.\n- No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 4's:** 89\n- **Total 8's:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

Each page from 1 to 488 is printed once, and we need to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all these page numbers and compare it to how many times '8' appears. Then, subtract the number of '8's from the number of '4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I think it's best to break this down by the number of digits in the page numbers. Pages 1 through 9 are single-digit, 10 through 99 are two-digit, 100 through 999 are three-digit, and so on. But since our book only goes up to 488, we don't need to consider four-digit page numbers.\n\nSo, let's categorize the page numbers:\n\n1. Pages 1-9: single-digit\n2. Pages 10-99: two-digit\n3. Pages 100-488: three-digit\n\nWe'll handle each category separately to count the occurrences of '4' and '8'.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9). Here, each digit from 1 to 9 appears exactly once. So, the digit '4' appears once, and the digit '8' also appears once. So, in this range, the count for both is the same, 1 each.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit pages (10-99). Each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. We'll need to count how many times '4' and '8' appear in each place.\n\nLet's consider the units place first. For each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group, '4' and '8' will each appear once in the units place. Since there are 9 groups (10-19 up to 90-99), each digit '4' and '8' will appear 9 times in the units place.\n\nNow, for the tens place. The tens digit is '4' for the group 40-49, and '8' for the group 80-89. Each group has 10 numbers, so in the tens place, '4' appears 10 times (from 40 to 49) and '8' appears 10 times (from 80 to 89).\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the count for '4's is 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19, and for '8's, it's 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19. So, again, they are equal in this range.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages (100-488). This is the largest range, so we need to be careful here. Let's break it down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. Since our book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The hundreds place is '1', so neither '4' nor '8' appears here.\n- For hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Similarly, the hundreds place is '2', so no '4' or '8' here.\n- For hundreds digit 3 (300-399): The hundreds place is '3', so again, no '4' or '8'.\n- For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The hundreds place is '4' for all these pages. So, each page from 400 to 488 will have a '4' in the hundreds place. Let's count how many pages that is. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place here.\n\nNow, let's consider the tens place in three-digit numbers. We'll need to look at each hundred group and see how many times '4' and '8' appear in the tens place.\n\nStarting with the hundreds digit 1 (100-199). The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and for each tens digit, there are 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, '4' appears 10 times (140-149) and '8' appears 10 times (180-189).\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299), the tens digit '4' appears 10 times (240-249) and '8' appears 10 times (280-289).\n\nFor hundreds digit 3 (300-399), the same applies: '4' in tens place appears 10 times (340-349) and '8' appears 10 times (380-389).\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the tens digit can be from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit '4' appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and '8' appears in 480-488, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, '8' appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, '8' appears 9 times in the tens place for the hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, summing up the tens place:\n\n- Hundreds 1: '4' =10, '8'=10\n- Hundreds 2: '4'=10, '8'=10\n- Hundreds 3: '4'=10, '8'=10\n- Hundreds 4: '4'=10, '8'=9\n\nSo, total '4's in tens place: 10+10+10+10 = 40\nTotal '8's in tens place: 10+10+10+9 = 39\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit goes up to 8, so when tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, '8' in tens place is 9 times here. So, '8's in tens place across all hundreds are 10+10+10+9 = 39.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. For each hundreds group, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, in each hundreds group, '4' and '8' will each appear 10 times in the units place per ten's group.\n\nWait, no, actually, for each hundreds group, each tens group (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.) has 10 numbers, and in each of these, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, for each hundreds group, in each ten's group, '4' appears once in the units place, and '8' appears once.\n\nSince each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has 10 ten's groups (0-9), but wait, 400-488 is a bit different because it doesn't go up to 499.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nFor hundreds digit 1 (100-199), there are 10 ten's groups (0-9), each with 10 numbers. So, in units place, '4' appears 10 times (once per ten's group) and '8' appears 10 times.\n\nSame for hundreds digit 2 (200-299): '4' appears 10 times in units place, '8' appears 10 times.\n\nSame for hundreds digit 3 (300-399): '4' and '8' each appear 10 times.\n\nNow, for hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the ten's groups are 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, there are 9 ten's groups (0-8). Each ten's group has 10 units digits (0-9). So, in each ten's group, '4' appears once in the units place, so 9 times for '4' in units place. Similarly, '8' appears once per ten's group, so 9 times for '8' in units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so when the ten's digit is 8, the units digits go up to 8, so '8' in units place would be present in 488. So, in the ten's group 8, units digits go from 0 to 8, so '8' appears once in units place (488). So, yes, 9 ten's groups, each contributing 1 '4' and 1 '8' in units place, except that in the ten's group 8, the units digit '8' only goes up to 488, which is included, so '8' appears once.\n\nWait, but actually, for each ten's group, regardless of how high the page goes, the units digits go from 0 up to 9 or up to the last digit if it's less than 9. So, in 400-488, the ten's digit goes up to 8, so for each ten's group 0-8, the units digits go up to 9 except for ten's group 8, where units digits go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in ten's group 8, the units digits are 0-8, so '8' appears once in units place (488). So, in units place for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- '4' appears once per ten's group (0-8), so 9 times.\n- '8' appears once per ten's group except for ten's group 8, where it appears once as well (since 488 is included). Wait, no, in ten's group 8, the units digits are 0-8, so '8' appears once. So, for each ten's group 0-8, '8' appears once in units place, so that's 9 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, '8' appears once in units place in ten's group 8.\n\nWait, but if the ten's group is 8, and units digits go up to 8, then '8' appears once in units place for that group. So, for each ten's group 0-8, '8' appears once, so total '8's in units place for hundreds digit 4 is 9.\n\nSimilarly, '4' appears once per ten's group, so 9 times.\n\nSo, for units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds 1: '4'=10, '8'=10\n- Hundreds 2: '4'=10, '8'=10\n- Hundreds 3: '4'=10, '8'=10\n- Hundreds 4: '4'=9, '8'=9\n\nSo, total '4's in units place: 10+10+10+9 = 39\nTotal '8's in units place: 10+10+10+9 = 39\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me double-check.\n\nIn hundreds digit 4, from 400-488, the ten's digit goes from 0 to 8, so 9 ten's groups. In each ten's group, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, except for the last ten's group (8), where it only goes up to 8. So, in each ten's group, '4' appears once in units place, so 9 times total. Similarly, '8' appears once in each ten's group except the last one, where it appears once as well because 488 is included. Wait, no, in the last ten's group (8), the units digits go up to 8, so '8' appears once. So, in each ten's group, '8' appears once, so 9 times total for '8's in units place in hundreds digit 4.\n\nTherefore, for units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds 1: '4'=10, '8'=10\n- Hundreds 2: '4'=10, '8'=10\n- Hundreds 3: '4'=10, '8'=10\n- Hundreds 4: '4'=9, '8'=9\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n'4's in units place: 10+10+10+9 = 39\n'8's in units place: 10+10+10+9 = 39\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in hundreds digit 4, the units place '4's should be 9, but in hundreds digits 1-3, it's 10 each, so 3*10 +9=39, same for '8's.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFirst, single-digit pages:\n\n'4's:1, '8's:1\n\nTwo-digit pages:\n\n'4's:19, '8's:19\n\nThree-digit pages:\n\nHundreds place: '4's=89, '8's=0 (since hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4; '8' doesn't appear in hundreds place until 800, which is beyond 488)\n\nTens place: '4's=40, '8's=39\n\nUnits place: '4's=39, '8's=39\n\nSo, total '4's in three-digit pages:\n\nHundreds:89 + Tens:40 + Units:39 = 89+40=129+39=168\n\nTotal '8's in three-digit pages:\n\nHundreds:0 + Tens:39 + Units:39 = 0+39=39+39=78\n\nNow, adding single and two-digit pages:\n\nTotal '4's:1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit) =1+19=20+168=188\n\nTotal '8's:1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit) =1+19=20+78=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) =90\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, single-digit: '4' once, '8' once. Correct.\n\nTwo-digit:\n\nUnits place: '4's=9 (each group 10-19,...,90-99, so 9 groups, each contributing 1 '4' in units place) same for '8's=9.\n\nTens place: '4's=10 (40-49), '8's=10 (80-89). So, total '4's in two-digit:9+10=19, '8's:9+10=19. Correct.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: '4's=89 (pages 400-488), '8's=0.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Hundreds 1: '4's=10 (140-149), '8's=10 (180-189)\n- Hundreds 2: same, '4's=10, '8's=10\n- Hundreds 3: same, '4's=10, '8's=10\n- Hundreds 4: '4's=10 (440-449), '8's=9 (480-488)\n\nSo, '4's in tens place:10+10+10+10=40\n'8's in tens place:10+10+10+9=39\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Hundreds 1: '4's=10 (once per ten's group, 10 groups)\n- Hundreds 2: '4's=10\n- Hundreds 3: '4's=10\n- Hundreds 4: '4's=9 (since ten's groups 0-8, each contributing 1 '4' in units place)\n\nSo, '4's in units place:10+10+10+9=39\nSame for '8's:10+10+10+9=39\n\nSo, three-digit '4's:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168\nThree-digit '8's:0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units)=78\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n'4's:1+19+168=188\n'8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of '4's printed is 90 more than the number of '8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of '4's printed is 90 more than the number of '8's.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding the problem. Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nHmm, okay, so I think I should break this down by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, and maybe even thousands, though in this case, the thousands place would only be relevant if the book had more than 1000 pages, which it doesn't. So, I can focus on units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once, and so does the digit 8. Therefore, in the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48.\n\nBut wait, I need to check the partial block as well, which is from 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding to the units place counts, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred block.\n\nSo, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (like 80-89). \n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, which means there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, there are 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nNow, let's check the partial hundred from 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. We need to see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this partial block.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410 (10 numbers), 1 for 411-420, 2 for 421-430, 3 for 431-440, 4 for 441-450, 5 for 451-460, 6 for 461-470, 7 for 471-480, and 8 for 481-488 (8 numbers). \n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears once in the range 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 4 for the entire block 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for the block 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in a complete hundred, but in the partial hundred, it's only up to 488, so the tens digit 8 only appears 8 times because the numbers go up to 488, not 490. So, in the partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 = 50, and the total number of 8's is 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 1-400, we have 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40 for both. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So yes, the 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's are 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, from 300-399, the hundreds digit is 3, and from 400-488, it's 4. So, the hundreds digit cycles every 100 pages, but in our case, the book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive).\n\nWait, but the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, but the hundreds digit is only 4 in the hundreds place for each of those pages. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's the number of pages from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, we subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 pages mean 48 complete blocks (48*10=480) and a partial block of 8 pages (481-488).\n- In each complete block, 1 4 and 1 8 in units place, so 48 each.\n- In the partial block (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred block has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 complete hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 each.\n- Partial hundred (401-488):\n  - Tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages.\n  - Tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages.\n- So, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place in a 488-page book.\n- So, hundreds place: 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for the tens place, in the partial block, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits printed. Let's see, 488 pages, each page has a number from 1 to 488. Pages 1-9 have 1 digit each, 10-99 have 2 digits each, 100-488 have 3 digits each.\n\nSo, total digits:\n- 1-9: 9 pages * 1 digit = 9\n- 10-99: 90 pages * 2 digits = 180\n- 100-488: 389 pages * 3 digits = 1167\nTotal digits = 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, the total number of digits should also be equal to the sum of all digits in all places. Let's see:\n\nFor units, tens, and hundreds places:\n\nUnits place: Each digit 0-9 appears equally in each block of 10. So, in 488 pages, units digits have 48 complete blocks (48*10=480) and a partial block of 8. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, plus in the partial block, digits 1-8 appear once each. So, digit 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and digit 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, tens place: Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in each hundred block, but wait, no, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in 4 complete hundreds, each digit appears 4*10=40 times. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so each digit from 0-8 appears a certain number of times.\n\nWait, maybe this approach is complicating things. Alternatively, since we've already calculated the number of 4's and 8's, and the total digits are 1356, let's check if the counts make sense.\n\nTotal 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 97\nSo, total digits accounted for by 4's and 8's: 188 + 97 = 285\nBut total digits are 1356, so the remaining digits are from other numbers, which is fine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place again to confirm.\n\nUnits place:\n- 48 complete blocks of 10: 48*1=48 4's and 48*1=48 8's\n- Partial block 481-488: units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488)\n- Total units: 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 complete hundreds: 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's\n- Partial hundred 401-488:\n  - Tens digit 4: from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's\n  - Tens digit 8: from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 8's\n- Total tens: 40 + 10 = 50 4's, 40 + 8 = 48 8's\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's\n- 8's: none, as 800-899 would be beyond 488\n- Total hundreds: 89 4's, 0 8's\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks in 480 pages, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred block (e.g., 1-100) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - In the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 488 pages.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the structure of page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number since the book has 488 pages. So, page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI think it's best to break this down by the number of digits:\n\n1. One-digit page numbers: 1 to 9\n2. Two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99\n3. Three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488\n\nI'll handle each case separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n**One-digit page numbers (1-9):**\nThe digit 4 appears once, on page 4.\nSo, count_4_1digit = 1.\n\n**Two-digit page numbers (10-99):**\nHere, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the ones place.\n\n- Tens place: Pages 40-49. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n- Ones place: Pages where the ones digit is 4, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 pages, so 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but page 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I'm counting both the tens and ones place? Hmm, but I think I should count each occurrence separately. So, for the ones place, it's 9 times, and for the tens place, it's 10 times. So total in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nWait, but page 44 would have two 4's, so when I count the tens place, I include 44, and when I count the ones place, I include 44 again. So, in total, for two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 19 times.\n\n**Three-digit page numbers (100-488):**\nThis is more complex because the hundreds, tens, and ones places can each have 4's or 8's.\n\nI think I should break it down by each digit place.\n\nFirst, let's handle the digit 4:\n\n- Hundreds place: Pages from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\n- Tens place: Now, looking at the tens digit being 4. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), we can check how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but actually, from 100-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so the tens digit can be 4 in each hundred. Let me think:\n\n- For 100-199: Pages 140-149. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n- Similarly, for 200-299: 240-249, another 10.\n- For 300-399: 340-349, another 10.\n- Now, for 400-488: The tens digit can be 4 in 440-449, but wait, 449 is within 488, so that's 10 pages. So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 pages, but 488 is the last page, so 449 is okay. So, yes, 10 occurrences in the tens place in the 400-488 range.\n\n- Ones place: Now, looking for 4's in the ones place. For each hundred, how many times does 4 appear in the ones place?\n\nLet's go through each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: Pages 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 pages.\n- 200-299: Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. 10 pages.\n- 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394. 10 pages.\n- 400-488: Now, from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the ones place? It's every 10 pages starting from 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, 484 is within 488, so that's 9 pages because 484 is the 9th occurrence (since 404 is the first, then 414, etc., up to 484). Wait, let me count: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 pages because 484 is the ninth. So, 9 occurrences in the ones place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total ones place occurrences: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488. The ones digit is 4, so starting at 404, each 10 pages. So, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the ninth. So yes, 9.\n\nSo, total ones place: 39.\n\nNow, summing up the three-digit numbers for digit 4:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Ones place: 39\n\nTotal in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nAdding up all the 4's:\n\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for digit 8.\n\n**Digit 8:**\n\nAgain, one-digit, two-digit, three-digit.\n\n**One-digit page numbers (1-9):**\nPage 8. So, count_8_1digit = 1.\n\n**Two-digit page numbers (10-99):**\n8 can appear in tens or ones place.\n\n- Tens place: Pages 80-89. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n- Ones place: Pages where the ones digit is 8, like 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 pages, so 9 occurrences.\n\nBut wait, page 88 has two 8's, so when I count the tens place, I include 88, and when I count the ones place, I include 88 again. So, total in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me check: For the ones place, from 10-99, how many times does 8 appear? It's 18,28,...,98, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. And the tens place is 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, yes, 19.\n\n**Three-digit page numbers (100-488):**\n\nAgain, hundreds, tens, ones.\n\n- Hundreds place: Pages where the hundreds digit is 8. But wait, our book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 0.\n\n- Tens place: 8 in the tens digit.\n\nLet's go through each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: Pages 180-189. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: 280-289, another 10.\n- 300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n- 400-488: Now, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 8 in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place in 400-488.\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\n- Ones place: 8 in the ones digit.\n\nAgain, for each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: Pages 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 pages.\n- 200-299: 208,218,...,298. 10 pages.\n- 300-399: 308,318,...,398. 10 pages.\n- 400-488: Now, 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 pages because 488 is included, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total ones place:\n\n10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nSo, total in three-digit numbers for digit 8:\n\n- Tens place: 39\n- Ones place: 39\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nOne-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488)\n- Tens: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +10 (400-449) = 40\nWait, earlier I thought 400-488's tens place was 10, but actually, 440-449 is 10 pages, so yes, 10. So, 10+10+10+10=40.\n\nOnes place:\n\n100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. Total 39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. Then 1+19+168=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nOne-digit:1\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (ones)=19\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place:\n\n100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. Total 39.\n\nOnes place:\n\n100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. Total 39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78. Then 1+19+78=98.\n\n188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8 and find the difference between the two counts. \n\nLet me start by understanding how digits are counted in numbers. Each digit can appear in different places: units, tens, hundreds, etc. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits, so I should consider each digit place separately.\n\nI'll break it down by each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers (like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). To find how many times it appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full times, and then the 48th group ends at 480, so the next 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within 488. So, actually, it's 48 times for the units place.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should calculate it as the integer division. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, but we take the integer part, which is 48. So, 48 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nThe hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, no, the page numbers go up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0 (for pages 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488).\n\nSo, for the tens place, the 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. \n\nBut wait, the last range is 440-449, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 blocks, so 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, units place: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, but actually, from 4 to 484, that's 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, so 48 full groups, but the last group ends at 484, which is within 488. So, units place is 48 times.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49, that's 10. Then 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50 times.\n\nHundreds place: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nAdding up: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nWe can calculate this by 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times. But let's check if 488 is included. 488 ends with an 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times.\n\nWait, because from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, the last number is 488, which is included. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). \n\nSo, for each hundred block except the last one, the tens digit 8 appears in 10 numbers. The last block (400-488) has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480-488). \n\nSo, how many such blocks? From 0-99: 80-89, that's 10. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me count again: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 49 + 49 is 98, but let me check again.\n\nWait, units place: 49 times, tens place: 49 times, so total 98 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 appeared 187 times, and 8 appears 98 times. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting the units place for 8.\n\nWait, units place for 8: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms are there?\n\nThe nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488.\n\nSo, 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, 49 terms. So, units place is 49 times.\n\nTens place: as calculated, 49 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n4's: 187.\n\nSo, difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's think about how many numbers have 4 in each digit place.\n\nAlternatively, for the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: For each 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and the last group (481-488) includes 484, which is another 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, because 488 \u00f7 10 is 48.8, so it's 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then the 48th group ends at 480, so the next group is 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so in 481-488, only 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more, making it 49. But earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, let me recount. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's the number of times 4 is the units digit, which is floor(488 / 10) + 1 if the last digit is 4 or higher.\n\nWait, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so floor(48.8) = 48. Then, since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so we add 1. So, units place for 4 is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. The units place for 4 should be 49 times, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, let's recalculate.\n\nTens place for 4: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), and 400-488:440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, 5 blocks \u00d710=50.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, earlier I thought units place was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Which is correct?\n\nLet me list some numbers to check.\n\nFrom 1 to 10: 4 appears once in units place (page 4).\n\nFrom 11 to 20: 14, so another 4.\n\nSimilarly, up to 480, which is 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the next 4 in units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place for 4 is 49.\n\nSo, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 48. So, units place for 4 is 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8:\n\nUnits place: from 8,18,...,488. The last one is 488, which is included. So, number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place: as before, 49 times.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nNow, 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nSo, difference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so now I'm getting 90 as the difference. But earlier I thought 89. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recalculate the 4's.\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99, plus 89=188.\n\n8's: units 49 + tens 49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 89. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me check the hundreds place for 4. From 400 to 488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nSo, 49+50=99, plus 89=188.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49, so 98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for 4.\n\nTens place for 4: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. From 0-99:40-49 (10), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), 400-488:440-449 (10). So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: 80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9). So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo, yes, 49 times.\n\nSo, the total for 4's is 188, 8's is 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 89. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place for 4. Let me recount.\n\nUnits place for 4: starting at 4, every 10 pages. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms?\n\nThe nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488.\n\nSo, 4 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u219210(n-1) \u2264484 \u2192n-1 \u226448.4 \u2192n \u226449.4. So, n=49.\n\nSo, 49 terms. So, units place for 4 is 49.\n\nSimilarly, units place for 8:8,18,...,488. The nth term is 8 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u219210(n-1) \u2264480 \u2192n-1 \u226448 \u2192n=49.\n\nSo, units place for 8 is 49.\n\nTens place for 4:50\n\nTens place for 8:49\n\nHundreds place for 4:89\n\nHundreds place for 8:0\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut earlier I thought 89, but now I'm confident it's 90.\n\nWait, let me check the hundreds place for 4 again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences, and the last group includes 484, adding 1 more. Total: 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block (440-449) is fully within 488. Total: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188** times.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488. Total: 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences. Total: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. Total: 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98** times.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the problem. Each page from 1 to 488 is printed once, and we need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears. Then, we subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I think I should break down the problem by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. Maybe I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the digits in the units place are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once.\n\nNow, let's find out how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll consider 48 complete sets, and then handle the remaining 8 pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8).\n\nIn each complete set of 10, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that's 48*1=48 fours and 48 eights.\n\nNow, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), let's check the units digits. The units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these, we have 48+1=49 fours and 48+1=49 eights in the units place. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Hmm, but wait, 488 is part of the 480-488 range, which is 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, no, 488 is the 488th page, so from 481 to 488 is 8 pages: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place gives us 49 fours and 49 eights. Wait, but 48 sets of 10 give 48 fours and 48 eights, plus 1 more four and 1 more eight in the last 8 pages, so total units place: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, units place contributes equally to both 4's and 8's. So, the difference so far is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Let's analyze how often 4 and 8 appear in the tens digit.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), etc., up to 9 (90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's apply this to our problem. The total number of pages is 488, which is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, we can think of it as 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nFirst, let's consider the complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these hundreds contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights in the tens place from the complete hundreds.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining pages: 401-488. Here, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), 8 (481-490), but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 481-488, which is only 8 pages, so the tens digit here is 8, but only for 8 pages (481-488), which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, not 10.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. The tens digit is determined by the second digit from the right. So, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0 (since 401 is 4 0 1, 402 is 4 0 2, etc.), then 411-420 have tens digit 1, and so on up to 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 481-488 have tens digit 8.\n\nSo, in the range 401-488, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 pages, right? Because 440-449 would be 440,441,...,449, which is 10 pages. So, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, that's 10 fours.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, no, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but actually, 480 is the first page in this range, so 480 is included. Wait, but 480 is part of the 480-489 range, but we only go up to 488, so the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is 4 8 0, so the tens digit is 8, and 481 is 4 8 1, up to 488, which is 4 8 8. So, that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, for the incomplete hundred, we have 10 fours and 9 eights.\n\nSo, adding this to the complete hundreds: 40 fours from complete hundreds, plus 10 fours from the incomplete hundred, so total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, eights in tens place: 40 from complete hundreds, plus 9 from the incomplete hundred, so 49.\n\nWait, but wait, let me confirm. The complete hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 each.\n\nIn the incomplete hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights.\n\nSo, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, the tens place contributes 50 fours and 49 eights, giving a difference of 1 more four than eight in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481, 482, up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, the difference in the tens place is 50 fours minus 49 eights, which is +1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears, since the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, and 4 for 300-399, 400-488.\n\nWait, but actually, 300-399 would have hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 would have hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, we have 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nSo, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours and 0 eights, giving a difference of +89 in fours.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nUnits place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nTens place: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nAdding them all together:\n\nTotal fours = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal eights = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total fours: 188, total eights: 98.\n\nDifference = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nEach 10 pages contribute 1 four and 1 eight.\n\nTotal complete sets of 10: 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8).\n\nSo, 48 fours and 48 eights.\n\nRemaining pages: 481-488, which is 8 pages.\n\nIn these, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 + 1 = 49 eights. That's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n\n4 complete hundreds: 4*10 = 40 fours, 4*10 = 40 eights.\n\nIn the incomplete hundred (401-488):\n\nFours in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours.\n\nEights in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights.\n\nSo, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours.\n\n8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n\nFours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nEights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n\nBut let me just think again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, in the incomplete hundred, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480 is included, so that's 9 pages: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 pages, so 9 eights in the tens place. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 fours. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 fours and 49 eights. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up, fours total 188, eights total 98. Difference is 90.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 pages: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Each set contributes 1 four and 1 eight.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488): Units digits are 1-8, so one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 10 times in each hundred.\n   - Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 sets, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights.\n   - **From complete hundreds:** 40 fours, 40 eights.\n   - Incomplete hundred (401-488):\n     - Fours: 440-449 (10 pages).\n     - Eights: 480-488 (9 pages).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99: Hundreds digit is 0 (not counted).\n   - Pages 100-199: Hundreds digit is 1.\n   - Pages 200-299: Hundreds digit is 2.\n   - Pages 300-399: Hundreds digit is 3.\n   - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4 (89 pages).\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to solve this step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Finally, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by understanding how digits are distributed in page numbers. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI remember that to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position, I can use a systematic approach. Let's break it down by each digit place.\n\n**Calculating the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - To find how many full blocks of 10 there are in 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full blocks and 8 extra numbers.\n   - So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 * 1 = 48.\n   - Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once here as well (484).\n   - Therefore, total 4's in units place = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred block.\n   - For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds in 488 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) need to be considered. The tens digit in this range cycles through 0-9 every 100, but here we only go up to 88.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490. But since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 appears only 8 times (481-488).\n   - Wait, but we're looking for the digit 4 in the tens place. In 401-488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, ..., up to 8 in 481-488. So, the tens digit 4 would appear in 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 488 is less than 490, so does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488.\n   - So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n   - Therefore, total 4's in tens place = 40 (from the first 400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all page numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive?\n   - 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - But wait, I'm calculating the number of 4's. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I considered 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, 48 full tens blocks (1-480), each contributing 1 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nAdding up: 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. Hmm, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When calculating the tens place, I considered 400-488. But 400-488 includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers. The tens digit 4 in this range is only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. So, yes, 50 in total.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 400-488. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188.\n\n**Now, calculating the number of 8's:**\n\nI'll follow a similar approach.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, in every block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - Number of full blocks of 10 in 488: 48, each contributing 1 8, so 48.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once (488).\n   - So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each block of 100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, each appearing 10 times.\n   - So, in 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-8 (since 488 is the limit).\n   - The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so 9 occurrences.\n   - Therefore, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nWait, let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 98.\n\n**Now, the difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me cross-verify.\n\nWait, earlier I thought 4's were 188 and 8's were 98, so the difference is 90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's and 8's again.\n\n**Rechecking 4's:**\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (1-480) gives 48 4's. Then 481-488: 484 is the only one, so 1 more. Total 49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 4's in tens place: 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449: 10 numbers. So, 50 total. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with hundreds digit 4. So, 89. Correct.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\n**Rechecking 8's:**\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (1-480) gives 48 8's. Then, 481-488: 488 is the only one, so 1 more. Total 49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400) gives 40 8's. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488: 9 numbers. So, 49 total. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised because I thought 4's would be more, but 90 seems high. Let me think if I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, 1 in the last partial.\n\nYes, so 4's are 188.\n\nFor 8's, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49 in tens place, plus 49 in units place, total 98.\n\nYes, so 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It says each page is printed once, starting from page 1 and ending at page 488. So, I have to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then count how many times the digit 8 appears. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when counting digits in numbers, it's often helpful to break it down by the units place, tens place, hundreds place, etc. So maybe I can separate the problem into counting how many 4's and 8's appear in each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit, like 4 or 8, appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then checking if there's any remainder.\n\nWait, but the book has 488 pages, so I need to see how many complete blocks of 10 there are and how many extra numbers there are beyond that.\n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. That means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). \n\nIn each of these 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48.\n\nBut wait, in the extra 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, does the digit 4 appear once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488)? Yes, that's correct. So, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 (from the blocks) + 1 (from the extra pages) = 49. Similarly, the number of 8's is 48 (from the blocks) + 1 (from the extra pages) = 49. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal, each appearing 49 times.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me check that again. The extra pages are from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. The units digits here are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, in the units place, both 4's and 8's occur once in the extra pages. Therefore, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place contributes equally to both counts.\n\nOkay, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, let's break it down into hundreds. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range.\n\nIn each of these 4 hundreds, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for the tens place, each digit 4 and 8 appears 4*10 = 40 times from the complete hundreds.\n\nNow, let's check the last partial hundred, which is 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8. Let's list the tens digits:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 441-450, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 for 481-490, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place for the last partial hundred:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- Digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, adding this to the previous counts:\n\n- Tens place 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50\n- Tens place 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 48 times.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The hundreds digit is:\n\n- 0 for pages 1-99 (since there's no hundreds digit in two-digit numbers, but if we consider three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99)\n- 1 for pages 100-199\n- 2 for pages 200-299\n- 3 for pages 300-399\n- 4 for pages 400-488\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so how many times does the digit 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nEach page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. Similarly, the digit 8 in the hundreds place would appear if there were pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 89 times\n- Digit 8 appears 0 times\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts for each digit place:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 49\n  - 8's: 49\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 50\n  - 8's: 48\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's and all the 8's.\n\nTotal number of 4's = Units + Tens + Hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's compute that:\n\n49 + 50 = 99\n\n99 + 89 = 188\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\n\nTotal number of 8's = Units + Tens + Hundreds = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the number of 8's is 97.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:\n\n188 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 91\n\nSo, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 488 pages, units digit cycles every 10. 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, with 8 remaining pages (481-488). In each cycle, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so 48*1 = 48 each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10 = 40 for each digit. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. For 4, it's 441-450, which is 10 pages. For 8, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, tens place 8's: 40 + 8 = 48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 89 4's. No 8's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. Subtracting these gives 91 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and I have to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and subtract the number of times 8 appears. The difference will tell me how many more 4's there are than 8's.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to count the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) and then sum them up.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the problem into units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once, and the same goes for 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same. But wait, I need to check if 488 is included or not, but since 488 is a three-digit number, the units place will go up to 8.\n\nWait, no, 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8 in the last page, but that's okay because 488 is included. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, in the incomplete set, which is 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this incomplete set, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, the units place contributes 48*1 +1 = 49 4's and 48*1 +1 =49 8's. So, in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 49 times each.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so the units digits go up to 8, so in the incomplete set, the units digits are 1 to 8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, yes, 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (11-19), up to 9 (91-99). So, in each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nFirst, let's find how many hundreds are there in 488. There are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nSo, for 4 complete hundreds (1-400), the number of 4's in the tens place is 4*10=40, and the same for 8's, 4*10=40.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, let's see:\n\nFrom 401-410, the tens digit is 0.\n411-420: tens digit 1.\n421-430: tens digit 2.\n431-440: tens digit 3.\n441-450: tens digit 4.\n451-460: tens digit 5.\n461-470: tens digit 6.\n471-480: tens digit 7.\n481-488: tens digit 8.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is only 8 pages, but the tens digit is 8, so the 8 in the tens place occurs once in this range (480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's from 480-488, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, but 480 is included? Wait, no, 480 is part of 401-488, but let's see:\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 pages, so from 401 to 488.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages).\n411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages).\n421-430: tens digit 2 (10 pages).\n431-440: tens digit 3 (10 pages).\n441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages).\n451-460: tens digit 5 (10 pages).\n461-470: tens digit 6 (10 pages).\n471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages).\n481-488: tens digit 8 (8 pages).\n\nWait, so in the tens place, for the 401-488 range, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place for the incomplete hundred (401-488):\n\nNumber of 4's: 10 (from 441-450).\nNumber of 8's: 8 (from 481-488).\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place:\n\n4's: 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n8's: 4*10 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check again. The complete hundreds are 1-400, so 4 complete hundreds. Each has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each.\n\nThen, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50.\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 +8=48.\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 -400 +1=89). So, each of these 89 pages has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: 89 (from 400-488).\nNumber of 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits:\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place:50\nHundreds place:89\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89= 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:48\nHundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) -97 (number of 8's)=91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nIn the tens place, 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89= 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. I think I might have made a mistake there.\n\nWait, when I calculated the units place, I considered that in each set of 10, there's one 4 and one 8. So, for 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 are there?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each.\n\nThen, the remaining 8 pages (since 48*10=480, so 480+8=488) are 481-488. So, in these 8 pages, the units digits are 1-8.\n\nSo, in the units place, in the incomplete set, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place:48+1=49 for 4's and 48+1=49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 40 each.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens place for 4's is from 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's.\n\nFor 8's, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, but since we're starting at 401, it's 480-488, but 480 is included in 401-488. Wait, 480 is page 480, which is within 401-488. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488). Wait, but 488-480+1=9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, but wait, 480 is page 480, which is part of the 401-488 range. So, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times, not 8 times. Wait, that's a mistake I made earlier.\n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 pages, but actually, it's 9 pages. So, that changes the count.\n\nWait, let me correct that.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the number of 8's in the tens place in this range is 9, not 8.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\nFor 4's:40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50.\n\nFor 8's:40 (from complete hundreds) +9=49.\n\nWait, but that's different from what I had before. So, that would make the total 8's in the tens place 49, not 48.\n\nSo, let me recalculate.\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's:49\n\n8's:49\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:50\n\n8's:49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89\n\n8's:0\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so now I get a difference of 90, but earlier I had 91. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count of the tens place.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nIn the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, in the tens place, 8's are 9 in the incomplete hundred, so total 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 8's are 49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nTotal 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 91, but now it's 90. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place.\n\nLet me recount the tens place in 401-488.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nEach tens digit from 0-8 occurs 10 times except for the last one, which might be incomplete.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (each 10 pages) and 8 pages in the last incomplete ten.\n\nWait, no, 88 pages is 8 full tens (80 pages) and 8 pages in the ninth ten.\n\nWait, but let me list them:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 pages)\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, not 9. So, the number of 8's in the tens place in the incomplete hundred is 8, not 9.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 pages: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, so 8 occurrences.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place in the incomplete hundred, 8's occur 8 times, not 9.\n\nSo, the earlier count was correct: in the tens place, 8's are 8 in the incomplete hundred, so total 8's in tens place:40+8=48.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0=97.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 91.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 9 pages, but actually, it's 8 pages because 481-488 is 8 numbers.\n\nYes, 481 is the first, then up to 488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, so 8 occurrences.\n\nTherefore, the correct count is 8 in the tens place for 8's in the incomplete hundred.\n\nSo, the total 8's in the tens place is 40+8=48.\n\nTherefore, total 8's:49+48=97.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nSo, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any other mistakes.\n\nLet me recount the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 pages (488-400+1=89). Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's.\n\nNo 8's in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nUnits place:49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens place:50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nSo, 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+48=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit numbers.\n\nI think the best approach is to break down the counting into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers separately. This way, I can systematically count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start with the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear exactly once. So, for single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 occur once. Therefore, the count for 4 is 1 and for 8 is also 1. The difference so far is 0.\n\nNext, I'll move on to the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I'll need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each of these positions.\n\nStarting with the units place for two-digit numbers: The digits cycle from 0 to 9 in the units place for each set of ten numbers. So, in each block of ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. Since there are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit numbers (10-99), that's 9 occurrences for each digit in the units place. So, units place contributes 9 for 4 and 9 for 8.\n\nNow, for the tens place in two-digit numbers: The tens digit can be from 1 to 9. Each digit from 1 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 for the digit 4). So, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times, and the digit 8 appears 10 times. So, tens place contributes 10 for 4 and 10 for 8.\n\nAdding the two together for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19, and the same for 8's: 9 + 10 = 19. So, the difference remains 0 so far.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. These have a hundreds place, tens place, and units place. I'll need to consider each position separately, but I also need to be careful because the hundreds digit doesn't go up to 9; it only goes up to 4 since the book ends at page 488.\n\nLet me break this down:\n\n1. Hundreds place:\n   - The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n   - For digits 4, how many times does it appear in the hundreds place? Well, pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. The number of pages here is 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 times for 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - For 8, since the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, 8 never appears in the hundreds place in three-digit page numbers. So, 0 times for 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each set of 100 pages. But since we're only going up to 488, I need to be careful with the last set.\n   - For the hundreds digit 1, 2, 3, and 4, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. But for the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 488 is 4-8-8, so the tens digit in 400-488 can go up to 8, but let me think again.\n\nActually, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred except the last one, which only goes up to 8 in the tens place? Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, for 100-199, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9, same for 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. But 400-488 is not a full hundred; it's 89 pages. So, in the tens place for 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 400-488 is from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, the tens digits in 400-488 go from 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit goes up to 8, but each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears a certain number of times.\n\nWait, but for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in 100-199, each tens digit from 0-9 appears 10 times (units 0-9). Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399. But for 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but how many times does each tens digit appear?\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many pages? Let's see:\n\n- 400-409: 10 pages (tens digit 0)\n- 410-419: 10 pages (tens digit 1)\n- ...\n- 480-488: 9 pages (tens digit 8)\n\nWait, so for tens digits 0 to 7, each appears 10 times, and for tens digit 8, it appears 9 times. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488).\n\nSo, for the tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (since in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place). So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 times for 4.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4, as we saw, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449). So, total for 4 in the tens place is 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 times.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place (480-488). So, total for 8 in the tens place is 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when considering the tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so each digit 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\n- For 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but as I calculated earlier, each digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times\n- 200-299: 10 times\n- 300-399: 10 times\n- 400-488: 10 times (440-449)\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\n\nFor digit 8 in the tens place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times\n- 200-299: 10 times\n- 300-399: 10 times\n- 400-488: 9 times\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times and 8 appears 39 times.\n\n3. Units place:\n   - For the units place in three-digit numbers, each digit 0-9 appears equally in each position, except possibly the last partial hundred.\n\n- For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the units place.\n\n- For 400-488, the units digit cycles through 0-9 for each tens group, except the last one which is 480-488, so units digits 0-8.\n\nWait, no, actually, for each tens group in 400-488, the units digits go from 0-9, except the last group which is 480-488, so units digits 0-8.\n\nBut wait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the number of complete tens groups is 8 (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) and then 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSo, for each of the first 8 tens groups (400-409, ..., 470-479), the units digit cycles 0-9, so each digit appears 1 time per group, so 8 times for each digit in the units place.\n\nThen, in 480-488, units digits go from 0-8, so digits 0-8 appear once each, and 9 does not appear.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the units place across 400-488:\n\n- In each of the first 8 tens groups, 4 appears once in the units place, so 8 times.\n- In 480-488, 4 appears once (484).\nTotal: 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the units place across 400-488:\n\n- In each of the first 8 tens groups, 8 appears once, so 8 times.\n- In 480-488, 8 appears once (488).\nTotal: 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nTherefore, for the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 3 times (from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) \u00d7 10 = 30 times, plus 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each digit appears 10 times in the units place. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nThen, for 400-488, as calculated, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, total for units place:\n\n- 4: 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39\n- 8: 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39\n\nSo, in the units place for three-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFirst, for digit 4:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place 0, tens place 39, units place 39. So, 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit counts.\n\nIn three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place for 4: 89 times (from 400-488)\n- Tens place for 4: 40 times\n- Units place for 4: 39 times\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39 times\n- Units place: 39 times\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding single and two-digit counts:\n\n4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the three-digit counts, especially for the units place.\n\nWait, for three-digit numbers, in the units place:\n\n- For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the units place. So, 3\u00d710=30 for each digit.\n\n- For 400-488: as calculated, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, total units place for 4: 30 + 9 = 39\nSimilarly for 8: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 for 8 in the tens place. So, 3\u00d710=30 for each digit.\n\n- For 400-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 10 for 4 and 9 for 8.\n\nTotal tens place for 4: 30 + 10 = 40\nFor 8: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place contributes 89 for 4 and 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 1 + 19 + 89 + 40 + 39 = let's calculate step by step:\n\n1 + 19 = 20\n20 + 89 = 109\n109 + 40 = 149\n149 + 39 = 188\n\nSimilarly for 8's:\n\n1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 1 + 19 + 0 + 39 + 39\n\n1 + 19 = 20\n20 + 0 = 20\n20 + 39 = 59\n59 + 39 = 98\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It says each page is printed once, starting from page 1 and ending at page 488. So, I have to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit '8' appears, then subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the problem by looking at each digit place separately: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits. So, I'll consider each digit position one by one.\n\nLet me start by calculating how many times each digit appears in the units place. For the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers. Since we're dealing with page numbers from 1 to 488, I need to see how many complete groups of 10 there are and then account for any remaining pages.\n\nBut wait, page numbers start at 1, so the first page is 1, not 0. That means in the units place, from 1 to 488, each digit from 0 to 9 appears the same number of times except for the last partial group if 488 isn't a multiple of 10. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10 and an additional 8 pages.\n\nIn each complete group of 10, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for the digit '4', in each group of 10, it appears once. Similarly, for the digit '8', it also appears once per group of 10.\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from the complete groups) plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 pages. The remaining pages are 481 to 488, so looking at the units digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Here, the digit '4' appears once (page 484) and '8' appears once (page 488). So, units place contribution: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, 8's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the last page is 488, which is included in the remaining 8 pages after 480. So, yes, the units digits from 481 to 488 are 1 through 8, so 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, units place: 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each block of 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), up to 9 (90-99). Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut since we're only going up to 488, we need to adjust for that. Let's break it down:\n\nFrom 1 to 400: There are 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for each digit, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. But wait, from 1 to 400, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, 4, but the tens digit is from 0 to 9 in each hundred. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, each digit appears 4*10=40 times.\n\nThen, from 401 to 488: This is 88 pages. The tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, let's see how many times each digit appears in the tens place from 401 to 488.\n\nFirst, from 401 to 410: Tens digit is 0, so 10 times, but wait, 401 is the first page, so the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, which is 10 numbers, but since 410 is included, that's 10 pages. Similarly, 411-420: tens digit is 1, 10 pages, and so on up to 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them.\n\nWait, let me correct that. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let's break it down:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488: 8 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0 to 7, there are 10 occurrences each, and for 8, there are 8 occurrences.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place from 401-488:\n\n- Digit 4: 10 times (from 441-450)\n- Digit 8: 8 times (from 481-488)\n\nSo, total in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50\n- Digit 8: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because from 1-400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place, as each hundred contributes 10 times per digit. So, for digit 4, in the tens place from 1-400, it's 40 times, and from 401-488, it's another 10 times (from 441-450). So total for 4 in tens place: 50.\n\nFor digit 8, from 1-400, it's 40 times, and from 401-488, it's 8 times (from 481-488). So total for 8 in tens place: 48.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this is correct because from 1-400, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 times for each digit, including 4 and 8.\n\nThen, from 401-488, as I broke down earlier, 481-488 has 8 numbers with tens digit 8, so adding 8 to the 40 from 1-400, making 48 for 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 441-450 has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so adding 10 to the 40, making 50 for 4 in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99: No hundreds digit, so 0 times.\nFrom 100-199: Hundreds digit is 1, so 100 times.\nFrom 200-299: Hundreds digit is 2, 100 times.\nFrom 300-399: Hundreds digit is 3, 100 times.\nFrom 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4, 89 times (since 400-488 is 89 pages, but wait, 488-400+1=89 pages, but actually, each page from 400 to 488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these, so 89 times.\n\nWait, but I think it's better to calculate it as:\n\nFrom 1-99: 0\n100-199: 100\n200-299: 100\n300-399: 100\n400-488: 89\n\nSo, for the hundreds digit:\n\n- 1: 100 times\n- 2: 100 times\n- 3: 100 times\n- 4: 89 times\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the hundreds place: 89 times\nFor digit 8: 0 times, because the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in 488.\n\nWait, but 8 is a digit, so in the hundreds place, 8 never appears because the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for hundreds place:\n\n- 4: 89\n- 8: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nStarting with 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow for 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFrom 1-488, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups). Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400: each digit appears 40 times in the tens place (4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times per digit).\n\nFrom 401-488:\n\n- Tens digits go from 0 to 8, with 401-410 (tens 0), 411-420 (tens 1), ..., 481-488 (tens 8).\n\nEach tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, for 4 in the tens place: 10 times (from 441-450)\nFor 8 in the tens place: 8 times (from 481-488)\n\nSo, total for 4 in tens: 40 +10=50\nTotal for 8 in tens:40 +8=48\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: 0\n100-199: 100\n200-299: 100\n300-399: 100\n400-488: 89\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in hundreds place, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0=97\n\nDifference:188 -97=91\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, is there a more efficient way to calculate this without breaking it down? Maybe, but I think the way I did it is thorough.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for digit counting. For each digit position, calculate the number of times a digit appears.\n\nBut I think my method is correct, so the difference is 91.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. Subtracting these gives 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, and then find the difference between those two counts.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem clearly. The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488, each printed once. So, I need to go through each page number and count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\nMaybe I can break this down by considering each digit place one by one. That is, I can calculate how many 4's and 8's appear in the units place, then in the tens place, and then in the hundreds place, and sum them up for each digit.\n\nLet me start with the units place because that might be the simplest. For the units digit, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8.\n\nFor example, from 1 to 10: 4 appears once (page 4), 8 appears once (page 8). From 11 to 20: 4 appears once (page 14), 8 appears once (page 18), and so on.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, the total number of complete blocks of 10 is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 complete blocks (each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place), and then a partial block from 481 to 488.\n\nSo, for the units place, the count of 4's is 48 times 1 (from each block) plus any additional 4's in the partial block. Let's check the partial block: pages 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in this partial block, the units digit 4 appears once (page 484). Therefore, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, each block contributes one 8, so 48 times, and in the partial block, the units digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Both 4's and 8's in the units place have the same count so far, 49 each.\n\nNow, let me move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 00 to 99, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the tens place, in each block of 100, it appears 10 times (40-49). Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, it appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and so does 8. So, for 4 complete blocks, that's 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences for both 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the partial block is from 401 to 488. Let's look at the tens digit here. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since the book ends at 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, the digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nSo, in this partial block, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440 to 449, but wait, the partial block starts at 401, so within 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449. But wait, does 440 fall within 401-488? Yes, 440 is included.\n\nSo, from 440 to 449, that's 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, 449 is included because 449 < 488. So, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the partial block.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, it occurs in 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488), so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial block.\n\nWait, but let me check that. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but the book only goes up to 488, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial block.\n\nWait, but when the tens digit is 8, it's from 480 to 489, but since the book stops at 488, it's 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place in the partial block.\n\nTherefore, for the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 4 complete blocks * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the partial block, total 50.\n- 8's: 4 complete blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the partial block, total 49.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit cycles every 1000 numbers, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWait, actually, page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages 400-488. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, how about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The highest hundreds digit is 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nWait, that's correct because 800 would be beyond 488, so no page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 times.\n- 8's: 0 times.\n\nNow, let me add up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that addition:\n\n49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, 8's total is 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nEach block of 10 has one 4 and one 8. There are 48 complete blocks (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 * 1 = 48 each. Then, the partial block from 481-488 has units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach block of 100 has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens digit. There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4 * 10 = 40 each. Then, the partial block from 401-488:\n\n- For 4's in tens place: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- For 8's in tens place: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n- 8's: none, since 800 is beyond 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n8's total: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4, which is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: 488 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the difference is 90, which is quite a large number. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately using a formula.\n\nFor a given digit d, the number of times it appears in each position can be calculated as follows:\n\n- For units place: total pages // 10 * 1 + min(max(d, (total pages % 10) - d + 1), 10 - d) if d <= (total pages % 10) else 0.\n\nWait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, for each digit position, calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to stick with my initial approach, as it seems systematic.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 times. So, 480 is included, and 488 is included, so that's 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times the tens digit is 8. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place in the partial block, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, another thought: when I calculated the units place, I considered the partial block from 481-488, but perhaps I should check whether 480 is included in the tens place counts.\n\nWait, no, in the tens place, 480 is part of the partial block 401-488, so it's included in the 480-488 range, which is why we have 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in the units place, the partial block is 481-488, which is pages 481 to 488, so units digits 1-8, so 484 has a 4 in units place, and 488 has an 8 in units place.\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: for the units digit, each page from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, total number of 4's in units place is (488 // 10) * 1 + (1 if 4 <= (488 % 10) else 0). Wait, 488 % 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1. So, 48 * 1 + 1 = 49. Similarly for 8's, it's 48 * 1 + 1 = 49.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nFor the tens digit, the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place is calculated as:\n\n(total pages // 100) * 10 + min(max(d, (total pages % 100) // 10 - d + 1), 10 - d) if d <= (total pages % 100) // 10 else 0.\n\nWait, maybe that's too convoluted, but for 4's in the tens place:\n\nTotal pages = 488.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 488 // 100 = 4.\n\nEach contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the remaining pages are 488 % 100 = 88 pages, so from 401 to 488.\n\nIn these 88 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488).\n\nSo, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, the number of times 4 appears is from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's total: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n### Units Place\n- Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- There are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages, contributing 48 occurrences of each digit.\n- The partial block from 481 to 488 contributes one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- Total 4's in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n- Total 8's in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n\n### Tens Place\n- Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- There are 4 complete blocks of 100 pages, contributing 40 occurrences of each digit.\n- The partial block from 401 to 488:\n  - 4's in tens place: 10 occurrences (440-449)\n  - 8's in tens place: 9 occurrences (480-488)\n- Total 4's in tens place: \\(40 + 10 = 50\\)\n- Total 8's in tens place: \\(40 + 9 = 49\\)\n\n### Hundreds Place\n- The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400 to 488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- The hundreds digit is never 8 within the range of 1 to 488.\n- Total 4's in hundreds place: 89\n- Total 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\n### Total Counts\n- Total 4's: \\(49 \\text{ (units)} + 50 \\text{ (tens)} + 89 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 188\\)\n- Total 8's: \\(49 \\text{ (units)} + 49 \\text{ (tens)} + 0 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 98\\)\n\n### Difference\n- The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\(188 - 98 = 90\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by understanding the problem. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nHmm, okay. So, maybe I should break this down by the number of digits in the page numbers. Pages 1 through 9 are single-digit, pages 10 through 99 are two-digit, and pages 100 through 488 are three-digit. I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges separately and then add them up.\n\nLet me start with single-digit page numbers. These are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits that are 4 and 8 are just the single numbers 4 and 8. So, for 4's, there's only one occurrence (page 4) and similarly, one occurrence of 8 (page 8). So, in single-digit pages, the count is 1 for both 4's and 8's.\n\nMoving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place separately.\n\nFirst, let's count the 4's in the two-digit numbers. \n\nFor the tens place: The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place: The units digit is 4 in numbers like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers because 44 has already been counted in the tens place, but wait, no, actually, each occurrence is separate. Wait, no, in the units place, regardless of the tens digit, each time the units digit is 4, it's a separate occurrence. So from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's 9 times because the tens digit can be from 1 to 9, so 14,24,...,94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, but wait, 44 has both a tens and a units digit as 4, so does that count twice? Yes, because each digit is counted separately. So, in the tens place, 40-49 gives 10 4's, and in the units place, 14,24,...,94 gives 9 4's, but 44 is included in both, so the total number of 4's in two-digit numbers is 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because 44 is counted once in the tens place and once in the units place, so it's two 4's in that single number. So, when I count the tens place, 40-49 gives 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens digit, that's 10 4's. Then, in the units place, 14,24,...,94, that's 9 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the units digit, so 9 4's. So, in total, 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nSimilarly, let's count the 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nFor the tens place: The tens digit is 8 for numbers from 80 to 89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place: The units digit is 8 in numbers like 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the units place.\n\nAgain, 88 has both tens and units as 8, so it's counted twice. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 8's.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check: from 10 to 99, the tens digit for 8 is 80-89, which is 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place, that's 10. Then, the units digit for 8 is 18,28,...,98, which is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the units place, so 9. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers is 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, both 4's and 8's occur 19 times each. So, the counts so far are:\n\nSingle-digit: 4's = 1, 8's = 1\n\nTwo-digit: 4's = 19, 8's = 19\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. These have hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nI need to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place separately.\n\nLet me start with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book has 488 pages. So, numbers from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nFirst, let's count the 4's in the hundreds place. That would be all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's.\n\nNow, for the 8's in the hundreds place: since the hundreds digit is 8, but the book only goes up to 488, which is less than 800, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers: 0.\n\nNext, let's count the 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers.\n\nThe tens digit is 4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10 numbers. In 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10. And in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total 4's in the tens place: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 10 (400s) = 40.\n\nWait, but wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit can be 4, but the units digit goes up to 88, so 440-449 is indeed within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 40 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nSimilarly, let's count the 8's in the tens place for three-digit numbers.\n\nThe tens digit is 8. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for numbers like 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nWait, 480-488 is in the 400-488 range, so the tens digit is 8, but the units digit can only go up to 8, since 488 is the last page. So, in 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, for each hundred:\n\n100-199: 180-189, which is 10 numbers.\n\n200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers.\n\n300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers.\n\n400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, that's 39 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's count the 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers.\n\nThe units digit is 4. For each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the units digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 104,114,...,194 in 100-199; similarly for 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the units digit can be 4 for numbers like 404,414,...,484. How many are there? From 404 to 484, stepping by 10, so that's (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 +1 = 8 +1 = 9 numbers.\n\nWait, let me check: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Yes, that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, for each hundred:\n\n100-199: 10 numbers with units digit 4.\n\n200-299: 10 numbers.\n\n300-399: 10 numbers.\n\n400-488: 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 has 9 numbers where units digit is 4, so total 39 4's in units place.\n\nNow, let's count the 8's in the units place for three-digit numbers.\n\nUnits digit is 8. For each hundred:\n\n100-199: 108,118,...,198, which is 10 numbers.\n\n200-299: 208,218,...,298, 10 numbers.\n\n300-399: 308,318,...,398, 10 numbers.\n\n400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, so from 408 to 488, stepping by 10, that's (488 - 408)/10 +1 = (80)/10 +1 = 8 +1 = 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total 8's in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, that's 39 8's in the units place.\n\nNow, let me summarize the three-digit numbers:\n\n4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 (as calculated earlier)\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\n8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39 (from earlier)\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, that seems off because 40 + 39 + 89 = 168 for 4's, and 39 + 39 = 78 for 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 4's. Earlier, I thought it was 40, but let me confirm.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, the tens digit is 4 for:\n\n140-149: 10 numbers\n\n240-249: 10\n\n340-349:10\n\n440-449:10\n\nThat's 4 sets of 10, so 40 4's in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, it's 10 +10 +10 +9 =39.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 10 +10 +10 +9 =39\n\nUnits place for 8's: 10 +10 +10 +9 =39\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units) = 168.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 (tens) +39 (units) =78.\n\nNow, let me add up all the 4's and 8's from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:168\n\nTotal 4's =1 +19 +168 =188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's =1 +19 +78 =98.\n\nWait, so total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 -98 =90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, 4's in hundreds place: from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nIn tens place for 4's: 10 per hundred, 4 hundreds, so 40.\n\nIn units place for 4's: 10 per hundred for first three hundreds, 9 for the last, so 39.\n\nSo, 89 +40 +39 =168.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nIn hundreds place:0\n\nIn tens place:10 +10 +10 +9=39\n\nIn units place:10 +10 +10 +9=39\n\nSo, 39 +39=78.\n\nTotal 4's:1 +19 +168=188\n\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +78=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, but wait, let me think again. When I was counting the units place for 4's in three-digit numbers, I included 404,414,...,484, which is 9 numbers. Similarly for 8's, 408,418,...,488, which is 9 numbers. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 4's, I had 10 in each hundred, including 400-488. So, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 40 in total.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first three are 10 each, and the last is 9, so 39.\n\nWait, but wait, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8 in three-digit numbers, 108,118,...,198, which is 10, same for 200s,300s, and 400s up to 488, which is 9. So, 39.\n\nSo, 8's in three-digit numbers:39 (tens) +39 (units)=78.\n\nSimilarly, 4's in three-digit numbers:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168.\n\nAdding up all 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:168\n\nTotal:1 +19=20; 20 +168=188.\n\n8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal:1 +19=20; 20 +78=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the difference seems quite large. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of 4's in the hundreds place. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I'm counting the 4's in the hundreds place, I'm only considering the 400-488 range, which is correct because other hundreds don't have 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s, so 0 8's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nNow, for the tens place in three-digit numbers, 4's:10 per hundred, 4 hundreds, so 40. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in the tens place:10 per hundred for first three, 9 for the last, so 39.\n\nUnits place for 4's:10 per hundred for first three, 9 for the last, so 39.\n\nUnits place for 8's: same as 4's, 10 per hundred for first three, 9 for the last, so 39.\n\nSo, total 4's:89 +40 +39=168\n\nTotal 8's:39 +39=78\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n4's:1 +19=20; 20 +168=188\n\n8's:1 +19=20; 20 +78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm starting to think that 90 might be the correct answer, but I want to make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this problem by considering each digit place separately across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of times 4 appears in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers.\n\nSimilarly, count the number of times 8 appears in each digit place.\n\nThen, sum them up and find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor units digit, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once, and 8 appears once.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete blocks, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each block of 10, units digit 4 appears once, so 48 blocks give 48 occurrences of 4, and 48 occurrences of 8.\n\nIn the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total units digit 4's:48 +1=49\n\nTotal units digit 8's:48 +1=49\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier count where I had 39 4's in units place for three-digit numbers, but maybe this approach is better.\n\nWait, let me check again. Using this method:\n\nUnits digit:\n\nNumber of complete tens: floor(488 /10)=48\n\nEach complete ten contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, 48*1=48 for 4's and 8's each.\n\nThen, the remaining numbers are 488 - (48*10)=488-480=8 numbers:481-488.\n\nIn these, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSo, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n\nThus, total units digit 4's:48 +1=49\n\nTotal units digit 8's:48 +1=49\n\nHmm, so according to this, units digit 4's and 8's each occur 49 times.\n\nBut earlier, when I broke it down by single, two, and three-digit numbers, I had different counts. That suggests that I might have made a mistake in the earlier approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try this digit-by-digit approach for each place.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with units digit:\n\nAs above, total units digit 4's:49\n\nTotal units digit 8's:49\n\nNow, tens digit:\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often in each position, except possibly the last partial hundred.\n\nThe number of tens digits is determined by how many complete hundreds we have and any remaining numbers.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100,101-200,...,401-488). Wait, no, 488 is less than 500, so actually, it's 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488, which is 88 numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider that for each digit place, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated based on higher digits.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for digit frequency.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\nhigher = N // 100\n\ncurrent = (N // 10) % 10\n\nlower = N % 10\n\ncount = higher * 10\n\nif current > d: count +=10\n\nelif current == d: count += lower +1\n\nSimilarly, for d=4 and d=8.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to calculate manually.\n\nWait, let's calculate the number of times 4 appears in the tens place from 1 to 488.\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit runs from 0-9 ten times each.\n\nSo, in each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-400, there are 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10=40 times.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers.\n\nThus, total tens digit 4's:40 (from 1-400) +10 (from 401-488)=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8: 180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-489. But since we're only going up to 488, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's:3*10 (from 1-300) +9 (from 401-488)=39.\n\nWait, but wait, 1-400 includes 401-488? No, 1-400 is up to page 400, and 401-488 is the next 88 pages.\n\nSo, in 1-400, the tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-489, but 480-489 is beyond 400, so in 1-400, the tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189,280-289,380-389, which is 3 sets of 10, so 30 times.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nThus, total tens digit 8's:30 +9=39.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's:50\n\nTotal tens digit 8's:39\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences.\n\nThe digit 8 in the hundreds place doesn't appear because the book only goes up to 488, so 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, hundreds digit 4's:89\n\nHundreds digit 8's:0\n\nNow, summing up all the digit places:\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal 4's:49 +50 +89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:39\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal 8's:49 +39=88\n\nWait, but earlier, when I broke it down by single, two, and three-digit numbers, I got 98 for 8's. Now, using this digit-by-digit approach, I get 88. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, let me check the units digit count again.\n\nUsing the digit-by-digit approach:\n\nUnits digit 4's:49\n\nUnits digit 8's:49\n\nTens digit 4's:50\n\nTens digit 8's:39\n\nHundreds digit 4's:89\n\nHundreds digit 8's:0\n\nTotal 4's:49 +50 +89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 +39=88\n\nSo, difference:188 -88=100.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I broke it down by single, two, and three-digit numbers, I had 188 4's and 98 8's, giving a difference of 90.\n\nWait, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the single and two-digit counts.\n\nLet me try recalculating the single and two-digit numbers using the digit-by-digit approach.\n\nSingle-digit numbers (1-9):\n\nUnits digit 4:1 occurrence (page 4)\n\nUnits digit 8:1 occurrence (page 8)\n\nTens digit:0 for both, since they are single-digit.\n\nSo, single-digit 4's:1\n\nSingle-digit 8's:1\n\nTwo-digit numbers (10-99):\n\nEach two-digit number has a tens and units digit.\n\nFor 4's in two-digit numbers:\n\nTens digit 4:40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nUnits digit 4:14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's.\n\nBut 44 is counted twice, once in tens and once in units, so total 4's:10 +9=19.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in two-digit numbers:\n\nTens digit 8:80-89, 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nUnits digit 8:18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nAgain, 88 is counted twice, so total 8's:10 +9=19.\n\nSo, two-digit 4's:19\n\nTwo-digit 8's:19\n\nThree-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nAs per the digit-by-digit approach, we have:\n\nUnits digit 4's:49\n\nTens digit 4's:50\n\nHundreds digit 4's:89\n\nTotal 4's:49 +50 +89=188\n\nUnits digit 8's:49\n\nTens digit 8's:39\n\nHundreds digit 8's:0\n\nTotal 8's:49 +39=88\n\nWait, but when I broke it down earlier, I had:\n\nSingle-digit 4's:1\n\nTwo-digit 4's:19\n\nThree-digit 4's:168\n\nTotal 4's:1 +19 +168=188\n\nSingle-digit 8's:1\n\nTwo-digit 8's:19\n\nThree-digit 8's:78\n\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +78=98\n\nWait, so according to this, the three-digit 8's are 78, but according to the digit-by-digit approach, it's 88.\n\nWait, no, that can't be.

    "text": " I need to make sure I count every 4 and every 8 in all the page numbers and then find the difference between those counts.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem clearly. Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and I need to count how many times the digits 4 and 8 appear in all these page numbers. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find how many more 4's there are.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the problem into smaller parts. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit place\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014and then sum them up.\n\nLet's start by considering each digit place one by one: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 full blocks of 10 and a remainder of 8. So, in each of these 48 blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no additional 4 in the units place here.\n   - So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 numbers. Each digit (including 4 and 8) appears 10 times in each block of 100. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 40-49, which is 10 times.\n   - Now, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block (401-488).\n   - In each full block of 100, there are 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 blocks give 4 * 10 = 40 fours.\n   - Now, the partial block is from 401 to 488. The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). The tens digit is 4 for numbers 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place.\n   - So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit cycles every 1000 numbers. For a 488-page book, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n   - So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours.\n   - But wait, let me check that. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for each number, so yes, 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 - 400 +1 = 89, correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check each part.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 40 from the first four blocks (each 100 pages) and 10 from 400-488, so 50 total. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, 48 fours because each 10 pages contribute one 4 in the units place, and since 488 is not a multiple of 10, the last partial block doesn't add any more 4's in the units place. So, 48 is correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\nNow, I need to do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, in each block of 10, the units digit is 8 once. So, 488 pages mean 48 full blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 pages (481-488).\n   - So, 48 eights in the units place from the full blocks. Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more in the units place (page 488).\n   - So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in blocks of 100. In each 100 pages, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - So, for 488 pages, there are 4 full blocks of 100 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block (401-488).\n   - Each full block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488. But wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but our book stops at 488, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here.\n   - So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, let me confirm. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 starting at 480. So, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights in the tens place from the partial block.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. When I was calculating the 4's in the tens place, I considered 400-488 and got 10 fours in the tens place because 440-449. Similarly, for the 8's in the tens place, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place from that partial block.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. In each 100-page block, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, 4 blocks give 4*10=40. Then, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49 in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 48 full blocks give 48 eights, and the last 8 pages (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so 1 more, totaling 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, when I calculated the 4's, I got 187, and the 8's are 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But that seems like a lot. Let me check if I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I overcounted the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me recount that.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, I had 50 fours: 40 from the first four blocks (1-400) and 10 from 400-488 (440-449). That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, 48 fours from 1-480, and none from 481-488, so 48 total. Correct.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 fours.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0, total 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I have a feeling that maybe I'm missing something because the hundreds place for 8's is zero, but maybe I'm not considering something else.\n\nWait, let me think again. The hundreds digit for 8's would be 8 in 800-899, but since our book is only up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8's again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 pages, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, in the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, each 100 pages contribute 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: total 98 eights.\n\nTherefore, the number of fours is 187, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify this with another approach. Maybe I can calculate the total number of digits and see if the counts make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about each digit place separately and see if the counts add up.\n\nBut perhaps I should just go through each digit place again carefully.\n\n**Rechecking 4's:**\n\n- Units place: For each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. The last 8 numbers (481-488) don't include another 4 in the units place, so 48 fours.\n\n- Tens place: For each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours, so 40. Then, in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, 10 fours. Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Rechecking 8's:**\n\n- Units place: Each 10 numbers, 8 appears once. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 8 appears once at 488. So, 49 total.\n\n- Tens place: Each 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds, 4*10=40. In the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers: 480-488. So, 9 eights. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: As before, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 fours minus 98 eights equals 89 more fours.\n\nWait, but I feel like 89 is a large number. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the hundreds place again. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about the hundreds place for 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the hundreds digit is never 8, so 0.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, in each 100 pages, 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40, plus 10 in 400-488, total 50.\n\nFor 8's, in each 100 pages, 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40, plus 9 in 400-488, total 49.\n\nIn the units place, 48 fours and 49 eights.\n\nSo, adding up, 187 fours and 98 eights, difference 89.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.  \n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4.  \n   - Total in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 fours in the tens place.  \n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 full blocks, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours.  \n   - From 401 to 488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 numbers).  \n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.  \n   - 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.  \n   - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.  \n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8.  \n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 8 (page 488).  \n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 eights in the tens place.  \n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 full blocks, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights.  \n   - From 401 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488 (9 numbers).  \n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).  \n   - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n187 (fours) - 98 (eights) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and I have to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit '8' appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the problem into smaller parts. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's separately in the units place and the tens place, and then add them up. But wait, page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number, so I should also consider the hundreds place.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For each group of ten consecutive numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit '4' appears once in the units place, and the same goes for '8'. \n\nNow, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of ten and then an additional 8 pages (481-488). So, in the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1 (from each group of ten) plus one more if the last partial group has a 4 in the units place. Wait, 481-488: the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in 484. So, total 4's in units place: 48*1 +1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: 48 groups of ten, each contributing one 8, so 48*1=48. Then, in the last partial group, 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So total 8's in units place: 48+1=49.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 49 times. Hmm, that's interesting. So, so far, the count for units place is equal.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears ten times in a group of 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in each hundred, the digit '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, '8' appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo, for each hundred, 4's in tens place: 10, 8's in tens place:10. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, the total 4's in tens place would be 4*10=40, and similarly, 8's would be 4*10=40.\n\nNow, let's check the last partial hundred, 401-488. The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digits cycle from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit '4' appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit '8' appears in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit '8' appears 9 times in this partial hundred.\n\nWait, but actually, in the tens place, each group of ten has the same tens digit. So, 401-410: tens digit 0, 411-420: tens digit 1, ..., 441-450: tens digit 4, 451-460: tens digit 5, 461-470: tens digit 6, 471-480: tens digit 7, and 481-490: tens digit 8. But since we only go up to 488, 481-488 is part of the tens digit 8 group, which is 8 numbers (481-488), but wait, 481-490 would be ten numbers, but we only have up to 488, so it's 8 numbers. So, the tens digit '8' appears 8 times in this partial hundred.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought it's 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480 is part of the hundreds place. Wait, no, 480 is in the 480-489 range, but our book ends at 488. So, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit '8' appears 9 times in this partial hundred. But wait, 480 is part of the hundreds place as 4, and the tens digit is 8, so yes, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nBut wait, 480 is included in 401-488, so in the tens place, the digit '8' appears 9 times (480-488). So, in the tens place for the partial hundred 401-488, '4' appears 10 times (440-449), and '8' appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 (from the four complete hundreds) +10 (from 440-449) =50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 4*10 (from the four complete hundreds) +9 (from 480-488) =49.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, in the hundreds place, the digit '4' appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit '4' appears 89 times. The digit '8' never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 0 (for 1-99), 1,2,3, or 4 (for 400-488). So, '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in hundreds place:89, and 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor '4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's=49+50+89=188\n\nFor '8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's=49+49+0=98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 488 pages, so 488/10=48 full groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- Then, the last partial group is 481-488, which has 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1-8, so '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 4's=48*1 +1=49, 8's=48*1 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- For each hundred, 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- So, 4*10=40 for both 4's and 8's in the tens place from the four complete hundreds.\n- Now, the partial hundred (401-488) has tens digits from 0 to 8.\n- The digit '4' in the tens place appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages (440-449), so 10 times.\n- The digit '8' in the tens place appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), so 9 times.\n- So, total in tens place: 4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- '4' appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 times.\n- '8' never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n- 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n- Difference:188-98=90\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the tens place in the partial hundred, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but 480 is part of the hundreds place as 4, and the tens digit is 8. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 9 times in the tens place for '8's in the partial hundred. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, the last partial group 481-488 contributes one '4' (484) and one '8' (488). So, that's correct.\n\nI think the calculations are correct, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each group of ten (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one '4' and one '8'.\n- There are 48 complete groups (480 pages) and 8 additional pages (481-488).\n- **4's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n- **8's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred has ten occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each for '4' and '8'.\n- The partial hundred (401-488) has ten '4's (440-449) and nine '8's (480-488).\n- **4's:** 40 + 10 = 50\n- **8's:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- '4' appears 89 times (400-488).\n- '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n- **4's:** 89\n- **8's:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The problem says that each page number is printed one time, starting from page 1 and ending at page 488. I have to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nSo, to approach this, I think I should break it down by the different places where the digits can appear: units place, tens place, hundreds place, etc. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits, so I need to consider each digit position separately.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten consecutive numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, each digit 1-9 appears once in the units place, and 0 appears once as well. But since we're starting from 1, the first page is 1, so the first units digit is 1, and it goes up to 488.\n\nWait, actually, when considering the units digit, it cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each group of 10 consecutive page numbers, the digit 4 will appear once in the units place, and the digit 8 will also appear once. So, the number of times each digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Since page numbers start at 1, the first 10 pages are 1-10. In these, 4 appears once (page 4) and 8 appears once (page 8). Similarly, pages 11-20: 14 and 18, so again each appears once. This pattern continues until page 480, which is a multiple of 10, so the last group before 488 would be 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have to adjust for that.\n\nWait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 481-488, which is only 8 pages. So, in the units place, how many 4's and 8's are there in each group?\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra pages.\n\nIn each complete group of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units digit, the number of 4's is 48 (from the complete groups) plus any 4's in the remaining 8 pages. Similarly, the number of 8's is 48 plus any 8's in the remaining 8 pages.\n\nLooking at the remaining 8 pages, which are 481-488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, the number of 4's and 8's is equal, both being 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each group of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for pages 80-89, which is 10 times.\n\nSo, how many complete groups of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then the remaining 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of these 4 complete groups, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred), and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well (e.g., 80-89). So, for the tens place, the number of 4's is 4 * 10 = 40, and the same for 8's, 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, we have the remaining 88 pages (401-488). Let's see how the tens digit behaves here. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, for the tens digit, we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nIn 401-410, the tens digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's in the tens place.\n\nIn 411-420, tens digit is 1.\n\nSimilarly, 421-430: tens digit 2.\n\n431-440: tens digit 3.\n\n441-450: tens digit 4.\n\nWait, 441-450: the tens digit is 4, so in this range, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (441-450). So, that's 10 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 451-460: tens digit 5.\n\n461-470: tens digit 6.\n\n471-480: tens digit 7.\n\n481-488: tens digit 8. So, in 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages (481-488). So, that's 8 more 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit contributes 10 more 4's and 8 more 8's.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from the complete groups) + 10 = 50, and the total number of 8's is 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 48 times. So, 4's are more by 2 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit trickier because it only appears when the page number is 100 or above. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, but pages 100-488 do.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears a certain number of times. Specifically, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. Let's calculate how many times that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning 89 times.\n\nThe digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if there are page numbers like 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the number of times 8 appears in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's summarize the counts for each digit place:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 49\n  - 8's: 49\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 50\n  - 8's: 48\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's add them up for each digit.\n\nTotal number of 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's = 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8. So, 48 each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, units total: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 to 4's and 10 to 8's. So, 40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8. For 4's, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, 10 more 4's. For 8's, the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 more 8's. So, tens total: 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +8=48 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds total: 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188\n\n8's:49 +48 +0=97\n\nDifference: 188-97=91\n\nSo, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nAnother way to think about it: 400 is page 400, and 488 is page 488. So, that's 89 pages. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nIn the tens place, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 pages, correct. And the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 pages, correct.\n\nUnits place: in the last 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when calculating the units place, I considered 488 pages, which is 48 complete groups of 10 (480 pages) plus 8 pages. So, 48*10=480, plus 8=488. So, correct.\n\nSo, I think the calculations are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97, so the difference is 91.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, so I think the answer is 91.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete groups of 10: 48 (488 \u00f7 10 = 48 with a remainder of 8).\n   - 4's: 48 (from groups) + 1 (in 481-488) = 49.\n   - 8's: 48 (from groups) + 1 (in 481-488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete groups of 100: 4 (488 \u00f7 100 = 4 with a remainder of 88).\n   - 4's: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. In 401-488, 441-450 adds 10 more \u2192 50.\n   - 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. In 401-488, 481-488 adds 8 more \u2192 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears from page 400 to 488: 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Finally, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the problem. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a 3-digit number. So, I should consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nI'll start by counting the number of 4's in each place.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - To find how many times 4 appears in the units place up to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full blocks of 10 and a remainder of 8. So, 48 times 1 is 48. But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Similarly, every 100 pages, the digit in the tens place cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, in every block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - Now, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block (401-488).\n   - Each full block contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - In the partial block (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 404-408, which is 5 times (404, 405, 406, 407, 408). Wait, that's 5 times, not 10, because we're only going up to 488, which is 88 in the tens and units place. So, the tens digit 4 occurs 5 times in this partial block.\n   - So total tens place 4's are 40 + 5 = 45.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (45) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 45 = 94, plus 89 gives 183. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 45 is 94, plus 89 would be 183, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, from 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. So total 4's are 49 + 45 + 89 = 183.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in each place.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, every 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, and the last partial block (481-488) includes 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So that's 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 pages, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - 488 divided by 100 is 4 full blocks, each contributing 10, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - In the partial block (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8. So, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, but in the tens place, 80-89 would be the tens digit 8, but in the 400s, it's 480-489. However, since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So that's 9 times.\n   - So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 183 - 98 = 85.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 183 - 98 is 85, but I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nLet me recheck the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial cycle (481-488) includes 484, which is another 1, so 49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 488 / 100 = 4 full cycles, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the partial cycle (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times, not 5. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. When I was counting the tens place for 4's, I thought from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times, not 5. So, earlier I said 5, but that's incorrect. It should be 10. So, the tens place for 4's is 40 (from full blocks) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 490, so 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, I think I made a mistake there. So, the correct count for tens place 4's is 50, not 45.\n\nSimilarly, let's correct the 4's count:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's check the 8's again:\n\n- Units: 49 (correct)\n- Tens: 40 (from full blocks) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place for 4's was 50, so that changes the total 4's to 188. Then, the difference becomes 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made another mistake. Let me go through the tens place for 4's again.\n\nIn the partial block after 400, which is 401-488, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nThe tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449. So, that's 10 numbers: 440, 441, ..., 449. So, that's 10 times. So, the tens place 4's in the partial block are 10, not 5. So, earlier I thought 5, which was wrong.\n\nSo, the tens place 4's: 4 full blocks (1-100, etc.) give 4*10=40, plus 10 in 440-449, so 50. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the tens place in the partial block (401-488) is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times, correct. So, 40 + 9 = 49 in tens place, plus 49 in units, total 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 183, but that was because I had miscalculated the tens place as 45 instead of 50. So, the correct total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have another mistake. Let me check the units place for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 8's: 4 full blocks (each 100 pages) contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's: 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 183, but that was because I had a miscalculation in the tens place. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I'm overcounting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this differently, using a formula or a more systematic method to count the digits.\n\nAnother way is to consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is equal to (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(d, N % 10), d). Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many full cycles of 10 there are, and then see how many in the partial cycle.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think as I did before: for units place, every 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for 488 pages, units place 4's: floor(488 / 10) = 48 full cycles, plus 1 if the last partial cycle (481-488) includes a 4 in the units place, which it does (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus 1 if the last partial cycle includes an 8, which it does (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place is calculated by considering how many full hundreds and then the partial hundred.\n\nFor 4's in tens place:\n\n- Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n- For 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n- Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more.\n- Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place:\n\n- Similarly, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n- For 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n- In the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 more.\n- Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n- For 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up:\n\n4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the problem. Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and we need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break it down by each digit place: units, tens, hundreds, and maybe even thousands, though in this case, since the book only has 488 pages, the thousands place won't be relevant because 488 is less than 1000. So, we'll focus on units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nFirst, let's handle the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 will appear once, and the digit 8 will also appear once. For example, from 1-10: 4 appears once (page 4), and 8 appears once (page 8). Similarly, from 11-20: 14 and 18, and so on.\n\nNow, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of these 48 groups, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. That gives us 48 occurrences of 4 and 48 occurrences of 8 in the units place.\n\nBut wait, we have those extra 8 pages: 481 to 488. Let's check the units digits here. The numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in this partial group, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the total for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. Hmm, so in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times. So, no difference there.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89, which is 10 times.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of these 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. So, that's 4*10 = 40 occurrences of 4 and 4*10 = 40 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's look at the extra 88 pages: 401-488. The tens digit here will cycle from 0 to 8. Let's break it down:\n\n- 401-409: tens digit is 0\n- 410-419: tens digit is 1\n- 420-429: tens digit is 2\n- 430-439: tens digit is 3\n- 440-449: tens digit is 4\n- 450-459: tens digit is 5\n- 460-469: tens digit is 6\n- 470-479: tens digit is 7\n- 480-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 times. How about 8? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 9 times.\n\nWait, so in the tens place for the extra 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nAdding that to the previous counts:\n\nTotal for tens place:\n- 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. That gives a difference of 1 in favor of 4's.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be pages with hundreds digit 8, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, adding that up:\n\nTotal for hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, let's go through each place again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal number of pages is 488. For units digits, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each group of 10. So, for 488 pages, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 48 complete groups (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488). In each group of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48*1 = 48 for each. Then, in the extra 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1 =49 for 4's, 48 +1=49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach block of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds (1-400) would have 4*10=40 for 4's and 4*10=40 for 8's. Then, the extra 88 pages (401-488). Let's check the tens digits:\n\n401-409: tens digit 0\n410-419: 1\n420-429: 2\n430-439: 3\n440-449:4 (10 times)\n450-459:5\n460-469:6\n470-479:7\n480-488:8 (9 times)\n\nSo, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times. So, adding to the previous 40, we get 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly pages 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for the extra 88 pages? From 401-488, the tens digits:\n\n401-409: 0\n410-419:1\n420-429:2\n430-439:3\n440-449:4 (10 pages)\n450-459:5\n460-469:6\n470-479:7\n480-488:8 (9 pages)\n\nYes, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate it another way to confirm.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\ncount = (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(d, N % 10), d)\n\nWait, perhaps a better formula is:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), the count of digit d is:\n\nhigher = N // (place * 10)\ncurrent = (N // place) % 10\nlower = N % place\n\nif current > d: count += (higher + 1) * place\nelif current == d: count += higher * place + lower + 1\nelse: count += higher * place\n\nBut maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, since we're dealing with small numbers, maybe it's easier to stick with our initial method.\n\nWait, but let's try applying this formula for the units place.\n\nFor units digit, place =1.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\nhigher = 488 // 10 =48\ncurrent = (488 //1) %10 =8\nlower =488 %1 =0\n\nSince current (8) >4, count = (48 +1)*1 =49\n\nSimilarly for digit 8:\n\nhigher=488//10=48\ncurrent=8\nlower=0\n\nSince current=8, which is equal to d=8, count=48*1 +0 +1=49\n\nThat matches our earlier count.\n\nNow, for tens place, place=10.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\nhigher=488//100=4\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current=8 >4, count=(4+1)*10=50\n\nFor digit 8:\n\nhigher=4\ncurrent=8\nlower=8\n\nSince current=8 >=8, count=4*10 +8 +1=40+8+1=49\n\nWait, that seems a bit different. Wait, when current >=d, it's higher * place + lower +1.\n\nWait, but in our case, for digit 8 in tens place, higher=4, current=8, lower=8.\n\nSo, count=4*10 +8 +1=48 +9=49. Hmm, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 4 in tens place, higher=4, current=8>4, so count=(4+1)*10=50.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nFor hundreds place, place=100.\n\nDigit 4:\n\nhigher=488//1000=0\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4\nlower=488%100=88\n\nSince current=4 >=4, count=0*100 +88 +1=89\n\nDigit 8:\n\nhigher=0\ncurrent=4 <8, so count=0*100=0\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, using this formula, we get the same counts as before.\n\nTherefore, the total counts are:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has exactly one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more '4' (484) and one more '8' (488).\n   - **Total for Units Place:** 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 80-89).\n   - In 400 pages, there are 4 such blocks, contributing 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) add 10 '4's (440-449) and 9 '8's (480-488).\n   - **Total for Tens Place:** 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - There are no pages with '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total for Hundreds Place:** 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **'4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **'8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I'm going to try to solve this step by step, even though I'm not too confident in my math skills yet. Let's take it slow.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem correctly. Each page from 1 to 488 is printed once, and I have to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all these page numbers and how many times '8' appears. Then, I subtract the number of '8's from the number of '4's to find out how many more '4's there are.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break it down by the number of digits in the page numbers. So, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, 100 to 488 are three-digit. I'll handle each group separately.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9). Here, the possible digits are 1 through 9. So, how many '4's are there? Well, only page 4, so that's 1 occurrence. Similarly, how many '8's? Only page 8, so that's also 1 occurrence. So, in single-digit pages, the count of '4's and '8's is equal, each being 1.\n\nMoving on to two-digit pages (10-99). Now, each page number is a two-digit number, like 10, 11, ..., 99. I need to count how many times '4' and '8' appear in the tens place and the units place.\n\nLet's think about the tens place first. For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9, and the units digit can be from 0 to 9. So, for each tens digit, the units digit cycles through 0-9.\n\nHow many times does '4' appear in the tens place? Well, the tens digit is '4' for the numbers 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so '4' appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, how about '8' in the tens place? That would be 80-89, which is also 10 numbers, so '8' appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place. For each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each group, the digit '4' appears once in the units place, same with '8'. Since there are 9 groups (10-19 up to 90-99), that's 9 times each for '4' and '8' in the units place.\n\nWait, but actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 groups of 10. So, in each group, '4' appears once in the units place, so 9 times in total for units place of '4'. Same with '8', 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up for two-digit numbers: '4's in tens place: 10, units place: 9, total '4's: 19. Similarly, '8's in tens place: 10, units place: 9, total '8's: 19.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when I add 10 (tens) + 9 (units), I get 19 for each digit. Hmm, but wait, in the two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers. Let me check if this makes sense. For '4's, in the tens place, 10 times (40-49), and in the units place, 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94), so 10 + 9 = 19. Similarly for '8's, 10 (80-89) + 9 (18, 28, ..., 98) = 19. So that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three digits to consider: hundreds, tens, and units. I need to count how many times '4' and '8' appear in each place.\n\nLet's break it down by each digit position.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nNow, how many times does '4' appear in the hundreds place? It's from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about '8' in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4, so '8' never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times for '8's in hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundred group. Let's consider each hundred group separately.\n\nFirst, 100-199: Tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten. How many times does '4' appear in the tens place? For each hundred, in the tens place, '4' appears in the 40-49 range, which is 10 times per hundred. But wait, 100-199 has 100 numbers, so for the tens place, '4' appears 10 times (140-149), same with '8' appearing 10 times (180-189).\n\nSimilarly, for 200-299: same thing, '4' in tens place appears 10 times (240-249), '8' appears 10 times (280-289).\n\nFor 300-399: same, '4' in tens place 10 times (340-349), '8' in tens place 10 times (380-389).\n\nNow, for 400-488: The hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, meaning that '4' in the tens place would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so '4' appears 10 times in the tens place here. Similarly, '8' in the tens place would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, '8' appears 9 times in the tens place in 400-488.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. In 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, for '4' in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For '8' in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, for the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- '4's: In 100-199: 10, 200-299: 10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10. So total '4's in tens place: 10+10+10+10=40.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480 is included, but 489 isn't. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is '8' in all of them, so that's 9 '8's in the tens place for 400-488.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, so '8' in the tens place would be in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, '8's in the tens place here are 9.\n\nBut for '4's in the tens place, in 400-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's.\n\nSo, for the tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- '4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40.\n\n- '8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the '8's in the tens place are 10 each, so 3*10=30, plus 9 in 400-488, totaling 39 '8's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, '4's in the tens place are 10 in each of the four hundred groups, so 4*10=40.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only 89 pages, so does that affect the count? No, because in the tens place, it's about the digit, not the overall range. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, regardless of the total pages in that hundred group.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. This is where it gets a bit more involved because we have to consider each hundred group and how many times '4' and '8' appear in the units place.\n\nLet's start with 100-199. In each ten's group (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each ten's group, '4' appears once in the units place, same with '8'.\n\nSince there are 10 ten's groups in 100-199, that's 10 times each for '4' and '8' in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 200-299: same thing, 10 times each for '4' and '8' in the units place.\n\nFor 300-399: same, 10 times each.\n\nNow, for 400-488: Let's see. The units digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten's group, but since the last page is 488, the last ten's group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, in 400-488, how many complete ten's groups are there?\n\nFrom 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, 480-488. So, that's 9 complete ten's groups (400-409 up to 470-479) and one incomplete group (480-488).\n\nIn each complete ten's group, '4' and '8' each appear once in the units place. So, 9 groups would have 9 times each for '4' and '8' in the units place.\n\nIn the incomplete group, 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8, so '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488). So, that's 1 each.\n\nTherefore, in 400-488, '4's in units place: 9 (from complete groups) + 1 (from 480-488) = 10.\n\nSimilarly, '8's in units place: 9 (from complete groups) + 1 (from 480-488) = 10.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For 400-488, the units digit for each ten's group:\n\n- 400-409: units digits 0-9, so '4' once (404) and '8' once (408).\n\n- 410-419: same, '4' once (414), '8' once (418).\n\n- ... and so on up to 470-479: same, '4' once (474), '8' once (478).\n\nThat's 8 complete groups (400-409 to 470-479), each contributing 1 '4' and 1 '8' in the units place, so 8 each.\n\nThen, the last group is 480-488, which has units digits 0-8, so '4' appears at 484 and '8' at 488. So, that's 1 each.\n\nWait, so that would be 8 (from 400-470) + 1 (from 480-488) = 9 '4's and 9 '8's in the units place for 400-488.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 10 each, but that might be incorrect because 400-488 is 89 pages, which is 8 full ten's groups (400-409 to 470-479) and one partial group (480-488). So, each full group contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8' in the units place, so 8 each, plus the partial group contributes 1 each, totaling 9 each.\n\nSo, in 400-488, '4's in units place: 9, '8's in units place:9.\n\nTherefore, across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- '4's in units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\n- '8's in units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, that seems consistent because in each hundred group except the last, '4's and '8's each appear 10 times in the units place, and in the last group, 400-488, they each appear 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up all three places for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: '4's:89, '8's:0.\n\n- Tens place: '4's:40, '8's:39.\n\n- Units place: '4's:39, '8's:39.\n\nSo, total '4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nTotal '8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nNow, let's add up all the digits from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit pages.\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n- '4's:1, '8's:1.\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- '4's:19, '8's:19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- '4's:168, '8's:78.\n\nTotal '4's:1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal '8's:1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of '4's is 188, and the number of '8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting with single-digit: 1 '4' and 1 '8' is correct.\n\nTwo-digit: I had 19 '4's and 19 '8's. Let me recount.\n\nIn two-digit numbers, '4's in tens place: 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's.\n\n'4's in units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 '4's.\n\nWait, but 44 is included in both, so does that count twice? No, because in the tens place, we're counting 40-49, which includes 44, and in the units place, we're counting 14,24,...,94, which also includes 44. So, 44 is counted twice, once in tens and once in units. But that's correct because 44 has two '4's. So, total '4's in two-digit numbers is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nSimilarly, '8's in two-digit numbers: 80-89 is 10 '8's in tens place, and in units place:18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 '8's. So, total '8's:10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place: '4's:89, '8's:0.\n\nTens place: '4's:40, '8's:39.\n\nUnits place: '4's:39, '8's:39.\n\nTotal '4's:89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nTotal '8's:0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\nTotal '4's:1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal '8's:1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference:188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to check is to calculate the total number of '4's and '8's in each digit position across all page numbers.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFor all pages from 1 to 488, each page number can be considered as a three-digit number with leading zeros if necessary, so 1 becomes 001, 10 becomes 010, etc. This way, each page number has three digits, making it easier to calculate digit occurrences.\n\nBut wait, actually, that might complicate things because leading zeros aren't printed, so pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit. So, perhaps it's better to stick with the original approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about each digit position separately across all page numbers.\n\nFirst, the units digit:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does '4' appear in the units place?\n\nIn every block of 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place. So, total blocks of 10 in 488 numbers: 48 full blocks (1-480) and a partial block (481-488).\n\nIn each full block, '4' appears once, so 48 times.\n\nIn the partial block (481-488), '4' appears at 484, so once.\n\nTotal '4's in units place:48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, '8's in units place: same logic. In each block of 10, '8' appears once, so 48 times in full blocks, plus in the partial block, 488 is included, so '8' appears at 488, which is one more.\n\nSo, '8's in units place:48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation where '4's in units place were 39 and '8's 39. Hmm, so perhaps my initial method was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the three-digit numbers. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I considered three-digit numbers separately, but perhaps I should treat all numbers as three-digit with leading zeros, so 001 to 488, which would make it easier to calculate each digit position.\n\nBut since leading zeros aren't printed, maybe it's better to adjust for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of '4's and '8's in each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does '4' appear in the units digit?\n\nAs I thought earlier, in every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. So, total number of tens is 48 full tens (1-480) and a partial ten (481-488).\n\nSo, '4's in units place:48 *1 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, '8's in units place:48 *1 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn the tens digit, '4' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does '4' appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, '4' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 '4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0-8, so '4' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (440-449). So, that's another 10 '4's.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, so '4's in tens place from 400-488:10.\n\nSo, total '4's in tens place:40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, '8's in tens place:\n\nIn each hundred, '8' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 '8's in the tens place:4*10=40.\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so '8' in the tens place is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 9 '8's.\n\nSo, total '8's in tens place:40 +9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\n'4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so '4's in hundreds place:89.\n\n'8' never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so '8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n'4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n\n- Tens place:50\n\n- Hundreds place:89\n\nTotal '4's:49 +50 +89=188.\n\n'8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n\n- Tens place:49\n\n- Hundreds place:0\n\nTotal '8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, this matches my earlier result. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I considered three-digit numbers separately, I had '4's in units place as 39, but now using this method, it's 49. So, where did I go wrong before?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the initial approach by not considering that in the three-digit numbers, the units place includes all three-digit numbers, but I might have undercounted because I didn't account for all the units digits properly.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nIn the initial approach, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Units place: '4's:10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39.\n\nBut in the correct method, considering all page numbers, it's 49.\n\nSo, the mistake was in the initial approach where I didn't account for all the units digits correctly in the three-digit numbers.\n\nBy using the digit position approach, I get the correct count.\n\nTherefore, the correct difference is 90 more '4's than '8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure.\n\nAnother way to calculate '4's in units place:\n\nTotal numbers from 1 to 488:488.\n\nNumber of '4's in units place: floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing 1 '4', so 48. Plus, if the last partial cycle has a '4', which it does at 484, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, '8's in units place: same logic, 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of '4's in tens place: For each hundred, 10 '4's in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40. From 400-488, 440-449 is 10 '4's, so total 50.\n\n'8's in tens place: From 1-400, 4*10=40. From 400-488, 480-488 is 9 '8's, so total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n'4's:89, '8's:0.\n\nSo, total '4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal '8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more '4's than '8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more '4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to '8's. \n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - '4' appears once (page 4).\n   - '8' appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears 10 times (40-49), '8' appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** '4' appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94), '8' appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - Total '4's: 19, '8's: 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears 89 times (400-488), '8' appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears 40 times, '8' appears 39 times.\n   - **Units place:** '4' appears 49 times, '8' appears 49 times.\n   - Total '4's: 89 + 40 + 49 = 178, '8's: 0 + 39 + 49 = 88.\n\n4. **Total counts:**\n   - '4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 178 (three-digit) = 198.\n   - '8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 88 (three-digit) = 108.\n\n5. **Difference:** 198 - 108 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to find out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both 4's and 8's.\n\nI'll tackle the digit 4 first. I'll break down the counting based on the position of the digit: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, I can calculate how many such groups there are up to 488.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: In every group of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 times. Then this repeats every 100 numbers. So, I can calculate how many such hundreds are there and multiply by 10.\n\nFor the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nWait, let me check that: 488 - 400 = 88, so adding 1 gives 89. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let me calculate each part step by step.\n\nFirst, for the units place of 4's:\n\nTotal page numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48 groups. Each group contributes 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times.\n\nBut wait, in the last partial group (from 481 to 488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place. So, that's an additional 1 occurrence. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 \u00f7 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, and the remainder is 8. So, the units digit 4 occurs once in each complete group of 10, so 48 times, plus once in the incomplete group if the remainder is >=4. Since 8 >=4, so yes, one more. So, 48 +1 =49.\n\nNext, the tens place for 4's:\n\nIn each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). Now, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488?\n\nWell, 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 blocks \u00d710 =40 times.\n\nNow, in the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, so 40-49 in the tens place would be 440-449, which is within 401-488. So, yes, that's 10 occurrences. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 4's:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8's.\n\nAgain, I'll break it down into units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place for 8's:\n\nIn every group of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, similar to the 4's, the number of complete groups of 10 in 488 is 48, each contributing 1 occurrence, so 48 times. Then, in the partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more occurrence. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 complete groups, each with one 8, so 48, plus one more in the partial group, so 49.\n\nNext, tens place for 8's:\n\nIn each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit 8 appears in the range 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, each block contributes 10 occurrences. There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4\u00d710=40 occurrences.\n\nIn the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 80-89 in the tens place would be 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the partial block, we have 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so yes, 9 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8's:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 8 only when the page number is from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49+49=98.\n\nWait, 49+49=98. So, 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 in the last partial group, totaling 49. That seems right.\n\n- Tens place: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. Total 50. That seems correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. That adds up.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 groups of 10, each with one 8, so 48, plus one in the last partial group, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in the last partial block, 480-488, which is 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place, so 9. So, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since the book doesn't reach 800. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nSubtracting: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's in the last block. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in the last block, 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we calculate the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the partial group = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (4 \u00d7 10) + 10 in the last partial group = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers from 400 to 488 = 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the partial group = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 in the last partial group = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 (since the book doesn't reach 800).\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the positions where the digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I should check each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last partial group from 481 to 488 has 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, making it 49 times in total for the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there up to 488? From 1-488, there are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Wait, that's 5 hundreds, but the last one only goes up to 488. So, for each hundred, except the last, there's a full set of 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. That's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 page numbers.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Hmm, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 page numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89. Then units and tens: 49 and 50, so total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last partial group is 481-488, which includes 488. So, 488 has an 8 in the units place, making it 49 times in total for the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 8 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there up to 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and the last partial hundred is 401-488. In each complete hundred, there's one range of 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, so 4 times 10 = 40. In the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 occurrences. Therefore, total for the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes it's easy to miscount, especially in the tens and hundreds places.\n\nWait, for the units place of 4: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, the last group is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's one more 4, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4: in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers, so 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place of 4: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. So, total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the units place of 8: same as 4, 49 times.\n\nFor the tens place of 8: in each hundred, 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, 8's: 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place for 4, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. But for 8's, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place in that range.\n\nWait, but 488 itself is included in both the units and tens place counts. Let me check if I double-counted somewhere.\n\nWait, when counting the units place for 8, 488 has an 8 in the units place, and in the tens place, 480-488 includes 488, which has an 8 in the tens place as well. So, 488 is counted twice, once in units and once in tens. But that's correct because 488 has two 8's. So, no problem there.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's, 444 would have two 4's, but in our counts, each digit position is counted separately, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the counts again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one '4'. There are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 '4's. The last group (481-488) includes 484, adding one more, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In each hundred, '4' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). With 4 complete hundreds and one partial (401-488), this gives 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers, each contributing a '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4', every 10 numbers contribute one '8'. There are 48 full groups, plus one more in 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In each hundred, '8' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). With 4 complete hundreds and one partial (480-488), this gives 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers exceed 488, so no '8's in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to solve this step by step, so let me think through it carefully.\n\nFirst, I understand that each page number from 1 to 488 is printed once. So, I need to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit '8' appears. Then, I can subtract the number of '8's from the number of '4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me break this down by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of '4's and '8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the pattern repeats every 10 numbers. In each set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles through 0-9. So, in each set, '4' appears once and '8' appears once. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nSo, for the units place:\n- Number of '4's = 48 sets * 1 '4' per set = 48\n- Plus, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, '4' appears once (at 484). Therefore, total '4's in units place = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's:\n- Number of '8's = 48 sets * 1 '8' per set = 48\n- In the last 8 numbers, '8' appears once (at 488). So, total '8's in units place = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems like both '4's and '8's have the same count in the units place, which is 49 each. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake because 488 is the last page, so perhaps the last set isn't complete? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, 488 is page 488, so the last page is 488, so the last set is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. So, units digits go from 1 to 8. So, '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488). So, yes, both have 49 each in the units place. So, no difference there.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, the digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for '4's in the tens place:\n- Each hundred contributes 10 '4's in the tens place. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nWait, no, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, from 1 to 400, there are 4 hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 '4's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 '4's.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times, but only up to 88. So, let's see: from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490). But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers (481-488). So, the tens digit '8' appears once in this last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but I'm focusing on '4's in the tens place. So, in the remaining 88 pages, how many times does '4' appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, 2 for 421-430, 3 for 431-440, 4 for 441-450, 5 for 451-460, 6 for 461-470, 7 for 471-480, and 8 for 481-488.\n\nSo, the tens digit '4' appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 '4's in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nTherefore, total '4's in the tens place = 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's in the tens place:\n\nIn the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 '8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit '8' appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit '8' appears 8 times? Wait, no, each tens digit represents a block of 10 numbers, so from 481-490, the tens digit is '8', but we only have up to 488, so that's 8 numbers. However, in terms of the tens place, each occurrence is a single digit, so how many times does '8' appear in the tens place in 401-488?\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing the count. Each time the tens digit is '8', it's for 10 numbers, but in this case, we only have 8 numbers (481-488), so the tens digit '8' appears 8 times? Or is it 1 time because it's the digit '8' in the tens place for those 8 numbers? Wait, no, each number from 481 to 488 has '8' in the tens place, so that's 8 numbers, each contributing one '8' in the tens place. So, that's 8 '8's.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 '8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last 88 pages, we have 8 '8's in the tens place. So, total '8's in the tens place = 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, '4's in tens place: 50, '8's in tens place: 48. So, the difference in tens place is 50 - 48 = 2.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 '4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit '4' appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's. So, total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor '8's in tens place: first 400 pages, 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit '8' appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers, so 8 '8's. So, total '8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, the difference in tens place is 50 - 48 = 2.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here because in the last partial hundred, the tens digit '8' appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 numbers, each with '8' in the tens place. So, that's 8 '8's. So, yes, 48 in total.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit is '4' for pages 401-488, because 400 is included as well, right? Wait, page 400 is included in the first 400 pages, so from 401 to 488, the hundreds digit is '4'.\n\nSo, how many numbers are there from 401 to 488? That's 488 - 400 = 88 pages. So, the hundreds digit '4' appears 88 times.\n\nWait, but page 400 is included in the first 400 pages, so from 1-400, the hundreds digit is '0' for 1-99, '1' for 100-199, '2' for 200-299, '3' for 300-399, and '4' for 400. Wait, no, page 400 is part of the 400s, so from 400-488, the hundreds digit is '4'.\n\nSo, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (including both 400 and 488). Wait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit '4' appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88, but now I'm seeing 89. Let me check: 400 is the first page with hundreds digit '4', and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, but since both ends are inclusive, it's 89 pages. So, '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, how about '8's in the hundreds place? Well, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches '8'. The hundreds digits are 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, '8' never appears in the hundreds place. So, '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nTherefore, the total '4's in hundreds place: 89, '8's: 0. So, difference here is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 '4's vs 49 '8's \u2192 difference 0\n- Tens place: 50 '4's vs 48 '8's \u2192 difference +2\n- Hundreds place: 89 '4's vs 0 '8's \u2192 difference +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of complete sets of 10: 48 (since 48*10=480), with 8 remaining pages (481-488).\n\nIn each set of 10, '4' and '8' each appear once in the units place.\n\nSo, '4's: 48 sets * 1 = 48, plus in 481-488, units digits go from 1-8, so '4' appears once (484). So, total '4's in units: 49.\n\nSimilarly, '8's: 48 sets * 1 = 48, plus '8' appears once (488). So, total '8's in units: 49. So, difference 0. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn the tens digit, each hundred contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n\nFirst 400 pages: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, '4's: 4*10=40, '8's: 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n\nIn the tens place, '4' appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 '4's.\n\n'8' appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 numbers, so 8 '8's.\n\nSo, '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n'8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nDifference: 50 - 48 = +2.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is '4', which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive).\n\nSo, '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n'8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nDifference: +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 (units) + 2 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 91 seems like a lot, but let me think again.\n\nEach '4' in the hundreds place contributes 89, which is the majority of the difference. The tens place adds 2 more, so total 91.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. Each page has a hundreds digit of '4', so that's 89 '4's. Correct.\n\nAnd since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with hundreds digit '8', so '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, yes, the hundreds place contributes 89 '4's.\n\nTherefore, the total number of '4's printed is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the counts. Wait, no, actually, I was calculating the difference, not the total counts. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the units place, '4's:49, '8's:49 \u2192 difference 0.\n\nIn the tens place, '4's:50, '8's:48 \u2192 difference +2.\n\nIn the hundreds place, '4's:89, '8's:0 \u2192 difference +89.\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nTherefore, there are 91 more '4's than '8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way: calculate total '4's and total '8's and subtract.\n\nTotal '4's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal '4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal '8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:48\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal '8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that matches. So, the answer is 91 more '4's than '8's.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place, I included page 400, which is part of the first 400 pages. So, from 1-400, the hundreds digit is '4' only starting at 400, right? So, page 400 is included in the first 400 pages, so from 400-488, that's 89 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way: the hundreds digit '4' appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 '4's in hundreds place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is accurate. Therefore, the number of '4's printed is 91 more than the number of '8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more '4's are printed than '8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes one '4' and one '8'.\n   - There are 48 complete sets (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - '4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - '8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - First 400 pages: 4 hundreds \u2192 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - Last 88 pages (401-488):\n     - '4's: 10 (441-450).\n     - '8's: 8 (481-488).\n   - Total '4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n   - Difference: 50 - 48 = +2.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - '8's: 0 (no page in 1-488 has '8' in the hundreds place).\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = +89.\n\nSumming the differences:\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +2\n- Hundreds: +89\n- Total Difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nThus, there are 91 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the problem. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a 3-digit number. So, I need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI'll start by calculating how many times the digit 4 appears in each place.\n\n**Calculating the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 consecutive numbers will have one 4 in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. That's 48 times.\n   - But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last group is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's correct. So, 48 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers will have 10 consecutive numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449.\n   - How many such groups are there? Since the book goes up to 488, there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488.\n   - In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 times.\n   - But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, but 40-49 is within 400-488? Wait, no, 400-488 is the hundreds place, and the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So, actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only once, for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens places with 4 would be 4 (from each hundred) *10 + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times? Wait, no, because in the first 400 numbers, each hundred has 10 tens places with 4, so 4*10=40, and then in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50. But wait, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so maybe I'm double-counting. Let me think again.\n\n   Alternatively, for the tens place, the number of times 4 appears is determined by how many times each ten's group occurs. Each ten's group (like 0-9, 10-19, etc.) repeats every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. Since the book goes up to 488, which is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, in each of the first 4 hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total tens places with 4 are 40+10=50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up the 4's in each place:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 48+50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\n**Now, calculating the number of 8's:**\n\nSimilarly, I'll check each digit place for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. That's 48 times.\n   - But wait, the last group is 480-488, which includes 488, so the 8 in 488 is included. So, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - How many such groups are there in 488 pages? There are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 400-488.\n   - In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 times.\n   - In the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more times.\n   - So, total tens places with 8 are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 to 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the 8's in each place:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nWait, 48+49 is 97. That seems correct.\n\n**Now, finding the difference:**\nNumber of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again because 90 seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nWait, when calculating the 4's in the tens place, I thought it was 50, but let me verify.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIt's in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n\nEach of these ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nIn the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 4's? Every 10 numbers have one 4, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488, so the units digit 8 is included, but the 4 in the units place would be at 4,14,...,484. 484 is the last 4 in the units place before 488. So, 48 times.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48+50+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for the 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 times, as each 10 numbers have one 8, and 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48.\n\nTens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., but wait, no, for 8's in the tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nEach of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 9 more.\n\nTotal tens places with 8: 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nSo, total 8's: 48+49=97.\n\nThus, the difference is 187-97=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut let me just cross-verify to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the number of 4's and 8's is to consider each digit place separately, which I did, so that should be accurate.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's printed is 97. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8 and subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the problem. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), 3-digit (100-488). \n\nI think I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Because the number of times a digit appears in each place can be calculated independently.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. I'll first calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place, then in the tens place, and finally in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the units place: In every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each block, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Plus, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So total units place 4s: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the last block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once at 484. So yes, 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, the tens place for 4: In every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 instances where the tens digit is 4.\n\nHow many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then a partial block from 401-488.\n\nSo, for each complete block of 100, we have 10 instances of 4 in the tens place. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the partial block from 401-488: The tens digit is 0 in 401-409, then 1 in 410-419, and so on up to 8 in 480-488. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 instances.\n\nSo, total tens place 4s: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488: The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs once in each hundred, so in 401-488, it's the same as 0-89 in the tens place, so 440-449 would be part of this, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, yes, 50 in total.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 4: The hundreds digit is 4 in all page numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, that's only if the hundreds digit is 4. So, yes, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4s is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89.\n\nLet me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with units place for 8: Similar to 4, in every block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 48 complete blocks (since 488 \u00f7 10 is 48.8), so 48 times, plus the last partial block from 481-488, which includes 8 once at 488. So, total units place 8s: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is included, so yes, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 appears at 488, so that's correct.\n\nNow, the tens place for 8: In every block of 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nWe have 4 complete blocks of 100 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 instances. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\nThen, the partial block from 401-488: The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8. So, 480-489 would be the tens digit 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total tens place 8s: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8s.\n\nSo, total number of 8s is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4s, we had 188, and for 8s, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nFirst, checking the 4s:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks (1-480) with 10 numbers each, so 48 \u00d7 1 = 48, plus 484 in the last block (481-488), so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, total 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4s: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nNow, for 8s:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 488 has an 8, so +1, total 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since the book doesn't go beyond 488. Correct.\n\nTotal 8s: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8s. Let me check again.\n\nIn the partial block 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit to be 8, the numbers would be 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, yes, 9.\n\nSo, 40 (from full blocks) + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, we can calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For any digit d (other than 0), the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(N / 10). Each group contributes 1 occurrence. Then, check if the remaining numbers after the last complete group include d.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\n- Number of complete groups of 100: floor(N / 100). Each group contributes 10 occurrences. Then, check the remaining part.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\n- Number of complete groups of 1000: floor(N / 1000). Each group contributes 100 occurrences. Then, check the remaining part.\n\nBut since N is 488, which is less than 1000, we don't have to worry about thousands.\n\nLet me try this formula for 4s.\n\nUnits place for 4:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488 / 10) = 48. Each contributes 1, so 48. Then, the remainder is 488 % 10 = 8. Since 8 >= 4, we add 1 more (because 484 is within 481-488). So, total 49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100: floor(488 / 100) = 4. Each contributes 10, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\nRemainder: 488 % 100 = 88.\n\nNow, in the remainder, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is determined by the second digit. So, from 0 to 88, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, we add 10. So, total 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 1000: floor(488 / 1000) = 0. So, 0.\n\nRemainder: 488.\n\nNow, hundreds digit is 4 when the number is between 400 and 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8s:\n\nUnits place:\n\nfloor(488 / 10) = 48, each contributing 1, so 48. Remainder 8. Since 8 >= 8, add 1 (488). So, 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nfloor(488 / 100) = 4, each contributing 10, so 40.\n\nRemainder 88.\n\nIn the remainder, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 0 to 88, the tens digit is 8 in 80-88, which is 9 numbers. So, add 9. Total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nfloor(488 / 1000) = 0. Remainder 488. Hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8s: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought, in the tens place for 8s, the remainder is 88, so the tens digit 8 occurs from 80-88, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: For the tens digit, in each hundred, the number of times 8 appears is 10 (from 80-89), but in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 only goes up to 88, so it's 9 numbers. So, that's why we add 9 instead of 10.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. The number of 4s is 188, and the number of 8s is 98, so there are 90 more 4s than 8s.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place for 4**:\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence.\n   - Total blocks: 48 (from 1 to 480) + 1 in the last partial block (484) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place for 4**:\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total from full blocks: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In the partial block (401-488), 440-449 contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place for 4**:\n   - From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\nTotal 4s: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units Place for 8**:\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence.\n   - Total blocks: 48 (from 1 to 480) + 1 in the last partial block (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place for 8**:\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total from full blocks: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In the partial block (401-488), 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place for 8**:\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\nTotal 8s: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 (4s) - 98 (8s) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I need to solve this step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand what exactly the problem is asking. It's about counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I have to find the difference between the number of 4's and 8's. So, I need to calculate how many 4's are there in total and how many 8's, and subtract the two.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears in a range of numbers, we can break it down by each digit place: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, I should probably analyze each place separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start by considering the structure of the page numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. For example, page 1 is a one-digit number, page 10 is a two-digit number, and page 100 is a three-digit number.\n\nI think it's best to handle each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits 4 and 8. Let me start by considering the units place first.\n\n**Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n\nFor the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a complete set of numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. But since we're going up to 488, I need to check if 488 is a complete set or if I have to adjust for the incomplete set beyond 488.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is the last page, so I don't have to go beyond that. So, I can think of it as 488 numbers, from 001 to 488, but actually, page numbers start at 1, so maybe from 1 to 488.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think of all page numbers as three-digit numbers, padding with leading zeros if necessary. So, pages 1 to 9 would be 001 to 009, pages 10 to 99 would be 010 to 099, and pages 100 to 488 would be 100 to 488. This way, each page number is three digits, and I can analyze each digit place separately without missing any.\n\nWait, but actually, when counting digits, leading zeros don't count because page numbers don't have leading zeros. So, page 1 is just 1, not 001. Hmm, that complicates things a bit because the hundreds digit is only present for page numbers 100 and above.\n\nI think the best approach is to consider each digit place separately, taking into account how many numbers have that digit in that place.\n\nLet me start with the units place.\n\n**Units Place Analysis:**\n\nFor the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place (except 0, which appears once in 10). Wait, actually, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly once in the units place every 10 numbers.\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, and then for the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, digits 1-8 each appear once more in the units place, and digits 9 and 0 don't appear in the remaining 8.\n\nWait, but page numbers start at 1, so from 1 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 9 in the first 9 pages, then 0 in page 10, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider that for each complete group of 10 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears once in the units place. But since page numbers start at 1, the first group is 1-10, where 0 appears once (in 10), and digits 1-9 appear once each. Then, each subsequent group of 10 pages (like 11-20, 21-30, etc.) also has each digit 0-9 appearing once in the units place.\n\nSo, the total number of complete groups of 10 in 488 pages is 48 full groups (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more pages (481-488).\n\nSo, in each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n\nTherefore, in 48 complete groups, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48, and similarly for 8, it's 48.\n\nNow, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, digit 4 appears once, and digit 8 appears once.\n\nTherefore, total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, total number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems equal, but let me check.\n\nWait, from 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each.\n\nThen, from 481 to 488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, yes, 49 each.\n\nSo, units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. So, no difference here.\n\n**Tens Place Analysis:**\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nWait, actually, for each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in 100 numbers, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut let's think carefully. From 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, ..., 9 for 90-99. So, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nSimilarly, from 101-200, the tens digit cycles again from 0-9, each appearing 10 times, and so on.\n\nSo, in total, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds do we have?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 100 is 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nSo, in each complete hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 complete hundreds, each digit appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), we need to see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nLet's break down 401-488:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 pages: 481 to 488.\n\nSo, let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place from 401-488.\n\nLooking at the tens digits:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nDigit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 40 + 10 = 50\n- Digit 8: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from 401-488) = 40 + 8 = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 48 times.\n\n**Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, there is no hundreds digit. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1 (100 numbers)\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2 (100 numbers)\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3 (100 numbers)\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4 (89 numbers, since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n\nWait, 488 - 400 = 88, so 89 numbers.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nNow, how many times does digit 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nIt appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nHow about digit 8? Since 8 is higher than 4, and our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4: 89\n- Digit 8: 0\n\n**Total Count of 4's and 8's:**\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that.\n\n49 + 50 = 99\n\n99 + 89 = 188\n\nSo, total number of 4's is 188.\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, 49 + 48 is 97, correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\n\nTotal 8's: 97\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, we subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's.\n\n188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, in the units place, both 4 and 8 had 49 each.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 had 50 and 8 had 48.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 had 89 and 8 had 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 in all of them, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the units place, both 4 and 8 have 49 each, which is correct because in 488 pages, each digit appears 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place. The total number of units digits is 488, so each digit should appear approximately 48 or 49 times.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so each digit appears 48 times, and then the remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 8 more digits, so digits 1-8 each get one more, making it 49 for digits 1-8. So, yes, digits 4 and 8 each appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each digit appears 40 times from the complete hundreds, and then in the incomplete hundred (401-488), digit 4 appears 10 times, and digit 8 appears 8 times. So, 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+8=48 for 8.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for the incomplete hundred. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n401-410: tens digit 0\n\n411-420: tens digit 1\n\n421-430: tens digit 2\n\n431-440: tens digit 3\n\n441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n\n451-460: tens digit 5\n\n461-470: tens digit 6\n\n471-480: tens digit 7\n\n481-488: tens digit 8\n\nSo, in 401-488, digit 4 appears in the tens place in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nDigit 8 appears in the tens place in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is given by:\n\nfloor(N/10) + (1 if d <= (N % 10) else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nfloor(N/100) * 10 + (min(max((N % 100) - (d * 10) + 1, 0), 10) if d < 9 else (N % 100) >= d * 10))\n\nWait, maybe that's too complicated, but perhaps for units and tens, I can use this formula.\n\nLet me try for digit 4 in units place:\n\nN=488\n\nfloor(488/10)=48\n\nIf 4 <= 488%10=8, then add 1. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in units place:\n\nfloor(488/10)=48\n\nIf 8 <=8, add 1: 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nFor tens place, digit 4:\n\nNumber of times digit 4 appears in tens place:\n\nLet's compute it as:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: floor(488/100)=4\n\nEach contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remaining part is 488%100=88.\n\nWe need to see how many numbers between 0 and 88 have tens digit 4.\n\nThe tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, if 88 >=40, then add 10.\n\nBut 88 is greater than 40, so add 10.\n\nSo total tens place for 4:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4, each contributing 10, so 40.\n\nRemaining 88:\n\nTens digit 8 is in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, but since 88 is less than 89, we have 88-80+1=9 numbers (80-88). Wait, but 80-88 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, how many?\n\nWait, from 80-88, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers (80,81,...,88). So, that's 9 numbers. But wait, in the remaining 88, we're considering numbers from 0 to 88, but actually, the tens digit 8 in the remaining 88 would be from 80-88, which is 9 numbers. So, add 9.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, in the tens place analysis, I had from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. But in the formula, it's 9 numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's clarify.\n\nWhen using the formula, we're considering the entire range up to 488, so the remaining part after 400 is 88, so from 0-88, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-88, which is 9 numbers (80,81,...,88). So, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nBut earlier, when I was analyzing 401-488, I thought that the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers (481-488). But wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 8 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it's 9. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the overall range with the partial hundred.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nThe formula for the number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N is:\n\nnumber = (N // 100) * 10\n\nremainder = N % 100\n\nif d < (remainder // 10):\n    number += 10\nelif d == (remainder // 10):\n    number += (remainder % 10) + 1\nelse:\n    number += 0\n\nWait, let me apply this formula for digit 8 in the tens place, N=488.\n\nN=488\n\nnumber = (488 // 100) * 10 = 4 * 10 =40\n\nremainder = 488 % 100 =88\n\nd=8, which is the tens digit we're looking for.\n\nSo, remainder //10 =8 (since 88//10=8)\n\nSo, d=8, which is equal to remainder//10=8.\n\nTherefore, number += (remainder %10) +1 = (88%10)+1=8+1=9\n\nSo, total number is 40+9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was counting manually, I thought that in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears only 8 times. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the manual count.\n\nWait, in the range 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in the numbers 480-488, but wait, 480 is part of 401-488? Wait, no, 480 is less than 488, but in the context of 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, but 480 is within 401-488, right?\n\nWait, 401-488 includes 480, so from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8. So, how many numbers is that?\n\n480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place from 401-488.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 because I was only considering 481-488, but that's incorrect. 480 is included in 401-488, so the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, that means in the tens place, digit 8 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) +9=49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I did the manual count, I thought it was 8 times. So, I must have made a mistake there.\n\nWait, let me recount.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. So, 480 is included, so that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 numbers, hence 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, digit 8 appears 40 +9=49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was counting, I thought it was 8 times, but that was incorrect because I didn't include 480.\n\nSo, that changes things.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 4 in the tens place, from 401-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nWait, but in the formula, it's 40 +10=50, which is correct.\n\nSo, that means I made a mistake earlier in the manual count, not including 480. So, the correct count for digit 8 in the tens place is 49, not 48.\n\nWait, but that can't be because 488 is the last page, so 480 is included. So, digit 8 in the tens place is 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check again with the formula.\n\nUsing the formula for digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nN=488\n\nnumber = (488 // 100)*10 =4*10=40\n\nremainder=488%100=88\n\nd=8\n\nremainder//10=8, which equals d, so number += (88%10)+1=8+1=9\n\nTotal=40+9=49\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, earlier, I had mistakenly thought that in the tens place, digit 8 appears 8 times, but it's actually 9 times in the incomplete hundred. So, the total for digit 8 in the tens place is 40+9=49.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 4 in the tens place, it's 40+10=50.\n\nSo, that changes the total counts.\n\nWait, so let me recalculate the total number of 8's.\n\nPreviously, I had:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:48\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's=49+48+0=97\n\nBut now, with the correct count, tens place is 49, so total 8's=49+49+0=98\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, no, because in the formula, the count for digit 8 in the tens place is 49, but earlier, I thought it was 48. So, let me recast the entire count.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recast the entire calculation.\n\nLet me go back and recalculate everything carefully.\n\n**Recounting:**\n\n**Units Place:**\n\nAs before, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages (48 groups of 10). Then, in pages 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each appear once more. So, digit 4 and 8 each appear once more, making their units place count 49 each.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n\nUsing the formula, digit 4 appears in the tens place:\n\nNumber = (488//100)*10=4*10=40\n\nremainder=488%100=88\n\nd=4\n\nremainder//10=8, which is greater than d=4, so number +=10 (since d=4 <8)\n\nSo, total=40+10=50\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nnumber=40\n\nremainder=88\n\nd=8\n\nremainder//10=8, which equals d=8, so number += (88%10)+1=8+1=9\n\nTotal=40+9=49\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- 4's:50\n- 8's:49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n\nDigit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nDigit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n\nNow, adding up:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal=49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal=49+49+0=98\n\nSo, difference=188-98=90\n\nWait, that's different from the previous 91. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's check again.\n\nWait, when I first did the tens place for 8, I thought it was 8 times, but now with the formula, it's 9 times, so total 8's in tens place is 49.\n\nSo, total 8's=49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nTotal 4's=188\n\nDifference=188-98=90\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I did the manual count, I thought that in the tens place, digit 8 appears 8 times, but that was incorrect because I didn't include 480.\n\nSo, the correct count is 9 times, making total 8's in tens place 49, leading to total 8's=98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the formula.\n\nFor digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nN=488\n\nnumber = (488 // 100)*10=4*10=40\n\nremainder=488%100=88\n\nd=8\n\nremainder//10=8\n\nSince d=8 equals remainder//10=8, we add (remainder%10)+1=8+1=9\n\nSo, total=40+9=49\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nAnd 4's are 49+50+89=188\n\nSo, difference=188-98=90\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought the difference was 91. So, I must have made a mistake in the manual count earlier.\n\nWait, let me recount the tens place manually.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nEvery time the tens digit is 8, which occurs in the ranges:\n\n80-89: 10 numbers\n\n180-189:10 numbers\n\n280-289:10 numbers\n\n380-389:10 numbers\n\n480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total:\n\n10+10+10+10+9=49\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the tens place:\n\n40-49:10\n\n140-149:10\n\n240-249:10\n\n340-349:10\n\n440-449:10\n\nTotal=10*5=50\n\nSo, yes, 50 times.\n\nTherefore, the correct count is:\n\n4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference=188-98=90\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that in the tens place, 8's were 48, but that was incorrect because I didn't include 480-488, which adds 9 more times.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n- Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n- **Total 4's:** 49\n- **Total 8's:** 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 times for each digit in 400 pages.\n- In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- **Total 4's:** 50\n- **Total 8's:** 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 does not appear.\n- **Total 4's:** 89\n- **Total 8's:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the problem. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a 3-digit number. So, I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I can look at each digit place one by one and calculate how many times that digit appears in that place across all page numbers.\n\nLet me first consider the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the digit 4 appears once (at 4), and the digit 8 appears once (at 8). This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. \n\nBut wait, the book has 488 pages, which is 488 numbers. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and a partial group of 8 numbers (since 0.8 * 10 = 8). \n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 (from each complete group) plus 1 if the partial group includes a 4. But in the partial group from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so 4 is included. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, it's the same. Each complete group of 10 has one 8, so 48 times. In the partial group, 8 is included as the 8th number, so that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem asks for how many more 4's than 8's. If both are 49 in the units place, maybe the difference comes from other digit places.\n\nLet me check the tens place next. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 40-49. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89.\n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit. \n\nNow, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear? From 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 times.\n\nSo, adding to the previous counts: 4's in tens place = 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's in tens place = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So yes, 4's have 10 more, and 8's have 9.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 (from each hundred) + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case because the book goes up to 488.\n\nThe digit 4 in the hundreds place appears only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Each 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1, and the partial group from 481-488 contributes 1 for 4 and 1 for 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 numbers contribute 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10 = 40 each.\n- In the partial hundred (401-488), 4's in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10.\n- 8's in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9.\n- So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50; 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89.\n- 8's: None, since the hundreds digit doesn't reach 8. So, 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I think about the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, but each page number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's consider the total number of digits printed.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can think of the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, another approach: For each digit place, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n- For 4: Number of complete groups of 10 is 48, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once. Total 48 + 1 = 49.\n- For 8: Similarly, 48 complete groups, each contributing 1, so 48. In the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears once. Total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 hundreds contribute 4*10 = 40. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n- For 8: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4*10 = 40. In the last partial hundred, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- For 4: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89.\n- For 8: None, as the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in this case.\n\nAdding them up, as before, gives 188 for 4's and 98 for 8's, so the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and I have to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all these page numbers and compare it to how many times '8' appears. The difference between these two counts will be the answer.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the problem into smaller parts. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) and then sum them up.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit '4' appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - To find how many times '4' appears in the units place from 1 to 488, I can divide 488 by 10. \n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take the integer part, which is 48. This means there are 48 full blocks of 10. Each block contributes one '4' in the units place, so that's 48 times.\n   - But wait, after 480, the next block would be 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have 481-488. In this partial block, the units digit '4' appears in 484. So that's one more '4'.\n   - So total '4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, the digit '4' appears in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is '4' for all 10 numbers.\n   - So in every 100 numbers, the tens place has '4' appearing 10 times.\n   - Let's calculate how many full hundreds are in 488. 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 '4's in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Now, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488) also have a tens place. In the range 401-488, the tens digit is '4' from 440-449. That's another 10 '4's.\n   - Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so 440-449 is within 488. So that's 10 more '4's.\n   - So total '4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds place is '4' for all numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - Each of these numbers has a '4' in the hundreds place, so that's 89 '4's.\n\nNow, adding up all the '4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal '4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So 89 '4's there.\n\nIn the tens place, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 '4's. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 '4's, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems right.\n\nIn the units place, from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one '4' in the units place. So 48 full tens (480) plus one more in 484, making 49. That's correct.\n\nSo total '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\nNow, let's do the same for '8's.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to '4's, in every block of 10, '8' appears once in the units place.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one '8', so 48.\n   - Now, the last partial block is 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit '8' appears in 488. That's one more.\n   - So total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block of 100 numbers has one such block where the tens digit is '8', contributing 10 '8's.\n   - Number of full hundreds in 488 is 4, so 4\u00d710=40.\n   - Now, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488) include 480-488. The tens digit '8' appears in 480-488 only if the tens digit is '8', but 480-488 is 480-488, so the tens digit is '8' from 480-488. Wait, but 480 is part of the hundreds place '4', but the tens digit is '8' in 480-488. So how many numbers have '8' in the tens place here?\n   - From 480-488, the tens digit is '8' for all 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, but 480 is the start, and 488 is the end. So that's 9 numbers, each contributing a '8' in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is '8' for all of them, so that's 9 '8's.\n   - Wait, but earlier I thought each block of 100 contributes 10 '8's in the tens place. But here, in the remaining 88 numbers, only 9 '8's in the tens place. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does '8' appear in the tens place?\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 '8's.\n- 180-189: another 10.\n- 280-289: another 10.\n- 380-389: another 10.\n- 480-488: since 488 is less than 490, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is '8' (480, 481, ..., 488). So that's 9 '8's.\n\nSo total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in the hundreds place, from 400-488, the tens digit '8' appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total '8's in tens place: 4\u00d710 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '8' only in the range 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches '8'. Therefore, '8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, adding up all '8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal '8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 1 to 488, the tens digit '8' appears in:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo that's 10\u00d74 + 9 = 49, which is correct.\n\nSo total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place had 49 '8's and the tens place 49, so 98 total. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the number of '4's is 188, and '8's is 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the '4's.\n\n**Recounting '4's:**\n\n- Units place:\n  - From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one '4' in units place. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 '4', so 48.\n  - Then, in the last partial block, 481-488, the units digit '4' is in 484. So that's one more, total 49.\n\n- Tens place:\n  - The tens digit is '4' in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n  - Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d710 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a '4' in the hundreds place. So 89.\n\nTotal '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Recounting '8's:**\n\n- Units place:\n  - From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one '8' in units place. 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 '8', so 48.\n  - The last partial block, 481-488, includes 488, which has '8' in units place. So one more, total 49.\n\n- Tens place:\n  - Tens digit '8' appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n  - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 '8's, so 4\u00d710=40.\n  - The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), each contributing a '8' in the tens place. So 9.\n  - Total tens place '8's: 40 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - As before, 0.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more '4's than '8's.\n\nBut let me think again. Did I miss anything?\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for '4's, I counted from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. That's correct because 488 -400 +1=89.\n\nIn the tens place for '4's, I had 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 '4's, so 50.\n\nUnits place for '4's: 49.\n\nTotal '4's: 188.\n\nFor '8's, units and tens each have 49, so 98 total.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of '4's printed is 188, and the number of '8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to solve this step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. Each page from 1 to 488 is printed once, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a digit appears, I can break it down by each digit place: units, tens, hundreds, etc. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits, so I need to consider hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately.\n\n**1. Counting the number of 4's:**\n\nI'll break this down into units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\n- **Units place:** The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 * 1 = 48 fours. Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8. So, 484 is in this block, which is another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- **Tens place:** Similarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. So, in each block of 100, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many full hundreds are there in 488?\n\n488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 hundreds place 4's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 40-49, that's 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place. Similarly, in 140-149, another 10, and so on up to 340-349. So, 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last block, 440-449 is another 10, so total 50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 four, so 48, plus the last 8 numbers, which include 484, so 1 more, making 49. So, 49 units place fours.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\n**2. Counting the number of 8's:**\n\nNow, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 eight, so 48. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds place eights. So, 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. That's 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 80-89, that's 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. So, 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: same as 4's, 49 eights.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98, and hundreds place is 0, so yes.\n\n**3. Calculating the difference:**\n\nNumber of 4's: 188\n\nNumber of 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 four, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place, so 1 more, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349: each contributes 10 fours, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, 440-449: another 10 fours, so 50 in total.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 eight, so 48. Then, 488 is in the last partial block, so 1 more, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: each contributes 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, 480-488: 9 eights, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, it's easy to overcount or undercount. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternative method: Instead of counting each digit place separately, maybe I can iterate through each page number and count the digits, but that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can think of the total number of digits and see if my counts make sense.\n\nWait, but 488 pages, so the total number of digits is:\n\n- Pages 1-9: 1 digit each, so 9 digits.\n\n- Pages 10-99: 2 digits each, so 90 pages * 2 = 180 digits.\n\n- Pages 100-488: 3 digits each, so 488 - 99 = 389 pages * 3 = 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so total digits accounted for by 4's and 8's would be 188 + 98 = 286 digits. That seems plausible because 286 is less than 1356, so it's possible.\n\nWait, but maybe I can check another digit to see if my counting method is correct. Let's say, count the number of 1's or 2's and see if it aligns with expectations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recount the 4's and 8's more carefully.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nSo, the first occurrence is 4, then every 10 numbers.\n\nSo, the number of such numbers is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, the last number is 484, which is 48*10 + 4 = 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 (for 484) = 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n4 appears in the tens place in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n\nEach of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 blocks plus the last partial block, but actually, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's correct, 5 blocks, 50 fours. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 blocks, but actually, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, that's 5 blocks, so 5*10=50. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\n8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nNumber of such numbers is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 ends with 8, we have 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\nTens place:\n\n8 appears in the tens place in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nEach of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has numbers from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNo eights, as before.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think I've double-checked each part, so I'm confident in this answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI remember that when counting digits in numbers, it's helpful to break it down by each digit place: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, I'll probably need to consider each place separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times each digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing 488 by 10 and then looking at the remainder.\n\nWait, actually, the number of complete groups of 10 in 488 is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then there are 8 remaining pages (481 to 488). So, for the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, and then the digits 1 to 8 appear once more in the remaining 8 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place, and the digit 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times as well. Hmm, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear the same number of times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit in the tens place cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for the tens place in these 88 pages, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 8 times (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. So, for the tens place in the remaining 88 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 times for 8.\n\nWait, that might not be right. Let me think again. From 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., 8 for 481-490. But since 488 is the last page, the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, which is 8 numbers (481-488). So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 8 times, and the digit 4 in the tens place appears 10 times (441-450). Therefore, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nSo, adding that to the 40 times from the complete hundreds, the total for the tens place is:\n\n- 4: 40 + 10 = 50 times\n- 8: 40 + 8 = 48 times\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 from 1-99, 2 from 100-199, 3 from 200-299, and 4 from 300-399 and 400-488. So, the digit 4 in the hundreds place appears from 300-399 (which is 100 numbers) and from 400-488 (which is 89 numbers, since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, total for hundreds place:\n\n- 4: 100 (from 300-399) + 89 (from 400-488) = 189 times\n- 8: Hmm, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? No, because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8: 0 times.\n\nWait, that makes sense because 800 would be beyond 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's summarize the counts for each digit in each place:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 189 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 189 = 288 times\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations again because 288 seems high for 4's, and 97 seems low for 8's, but maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, let's go through each digit place again to make sure.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nEach page from 1 to 488. The units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, for 488 pages, the number of complete cycles is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 extra pages (481-488).\n\nIn each complete cycle of 10, each digit from 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for each digit, 48 times from the complete cycles. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so each digit from 1 to 8 appears once more. Therefore, for digits 1-8, they each appear 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. For digits 0,9, they only appear 48 times. So, 4 and 8 each appear 49 times in the units place. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach cycle of 100 pages, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for each digit, 4*10 = 40 times from the complete hundreds.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 8 times because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, no. Let's think about it. From 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410 (10 numbers), 1 for 411-420 (10 numbers), ..., up to 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the remaining 88 pages, and the digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450). So, for the tens place:\n\n- 4: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50 times\n- 8: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48 times\n\nThat's correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nAs I thought earlier, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, and 4 for 300-399 and 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 300-399 (100 numbers) and 400-488 (89 numbers). So, 100 + 89 = 189 times for 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because the book ends at 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 189\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 189 = 288\n\nFor 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 48\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 288, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 288 - 97 = 191.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me just double-check the hundreds place for 4. From 300-399, that's 100 pages, so 100 times 4 in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. So, 100 + 89 = 189. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place, in the remaining 88 pages, 441-450 is 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 481-488 is 8 pages, so 8 appears 8 times in the tens place. That adds up correctly.\n\nUnits place seems correct as well. So, the total for 4 is 288, and for 8 it's 97. The difference is indeed 191.\n\nSo, the answer should be 191 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in complete groups of 10 pages (480 pages).\n- Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more occurrence for digits 1-8.\n- **4's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n- **8's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each group of 100 pages.\n- 4 complete hundreds (1-400) give 40 occurrences each for 4 and 8.\n- Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n  - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n  - 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n- **4's:** 40 + 10 = 50\n- **8's:** 40 + 8 = 48\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears in 300-399 (100 times) and 400-488 (89 times).\n- **4's:** 100 + 89 = 189\n- **8's:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 189 (hundreds) = 288\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 288 - 97 = 191\n\n$\\boxed{191}$"

    "text": " I need to think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the problem into smaller parts. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. So, I'll need to consider each case separately.\n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers: these are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (on page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (on page 8). So, for one-digit numbers, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers: these are from 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place and in the units place.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears in the tens place for the numbers 40 to 49. That's 10 times (40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49).\n- The digit 8 appears in the tens place for the numbers 80 to 89. That's also 10 times.\n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears in the units place once every 10 numbers. So, from 10 to 99, that's 9 times (14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94). Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 9 decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 9 times.\n- Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the units place once every 10 numbers, so from 10 to 99, that's 9 times (18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98).\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Similarly, the total number of 8's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. So, again, they are equal in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: these are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 will only go up to 488, not 499.\n\nI'll break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place:\n- The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, and 800 isn't part of it. So, 0 times.\n\nNext, the tens place for three-digit numbers:\n- For the digit 4 in the tens place: this occurs in numbers like 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. However, since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 440-449, which is fine.\n  - Each of these decades contributes 10 numbers, so 4 times 10 = 40 times for the digit 4 in the tens place.\n- For the digit 8 in the tens place: this occurs in numbers like 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive).\n  - So, the first three decades (180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 times, so 3*10=30, and the last set 480-488 contributes 9 times. So, total 30 + 9 = 39 times for the digit 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place for three-digit numbers:\n- For the digit 4 in the units place: this occurs once every 10 numbers. So, from 100 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n  - The number of complete decades from 100 to 488 is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades). In each decade, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times.\n  - But wait, 488 is the last page. So, the last partial decade is 480-488, which includes 484 as a page number, so that's another 4 in the units place. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n- For the digit 8 in the units place: similarly, this occurs once every 10 numbers. From 100 to 488, how many times?\n  - Again, 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times.\n  - The last partial decade, 480-488, includes 488, which is another 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check that again. For the units place, from 100 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, the first occurrence is 104, then 114, 124, ..., up to 484. How many terms are there in this sequence?\n\nThe sequence starts at 104 and ends at 484, with a common difference of 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((484 - 104)/10) + 1 = (380/10) + 1 = 38 + 1 = 39. Wait, that's different from my earlier count. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nOh, I think I made a mistake earlier. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 100 to 488 is actually the number of numbers ending with 4 in that range. So, starting at 104, each subsequent number is 10 more, so 104, 114, 124, ..., 484.\n\nTo find how many terms, let's compute: (484 - 104)/10 + 1 = (380)/10 + 1 = 38 + 1 = 39. So, 39 times for 4 in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place: starting at 108, 118, 128, ..., 488.\n\nNumber of terms: (488 - 108)/10 + 1 = (380)/10 + 1 = 38 + 1 = 39. So, 39 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 49 times, but that was incorrect. So, the correct count is 39 times for both 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, correcting that:\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, summarizing the three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nAdding these up:\n\nFor 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nFor 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check the tens place for 4's. I said 40 times because there are four decades (140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4*10=40. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, it's three full decades (180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 30, plus the last partial decade from 480-488, which has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 30 + 9 = 39. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: both 4 and 8 appear 39 times each. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the digits from one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4's:\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nOne-digit: 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\nTwo-digit: 4 appears 19 times, 8 appears 19 times.\n\nThree-digit: 4 appears 168 times, 8 appears 78 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the three-digit numbers. Let's recalculate the three-digit numbers.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nTens place: 4 appears in 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So, 4*10=40.\n\nUnits place: 4 appears in 104, 114, ..., 484. As calculated earlier, that's 39 times.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTens place: 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 3*10 +9=39.\n\nUnits place: 108, 118, ..., 488. That's 39 times.\n\nSo, 0 + 39 + 39 =78. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, 8's:98. Difference is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place for 4's was 39, but when I initially thought of 48 full decades plus one more, I thought 49, but that was wrong. It's actually 39. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again the units place for 4's. From 100 to 488, how many numbers end with 4?\n\nThe first is 104, then 114, 124, ..., 484.\n\nThe number of terms is ((484 - 104)/10) +1 = (380/10)+1=38+1=39. So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: 108, 118, ..., 488. Number of terms: ((488 - 108)/10)+1= (380/10)+1=38+1=39. So, correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit numbers again. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40, correct.\n\nIn the units place, 39 times, correct.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168 for 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTens place: 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 3*10 +9=39.\n\nUnits place: 39 times.\n\nSo, 0+39+39=78.\n\nAdding the one-digit and two-digit:\n\n4's:1+19+168=188.\n\n8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and I have to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit '8'. After that, I subtract the number of '8's from the number of '4's to find out how many more '4's there are.\n\nOkay, so maybe I should start by figuring out how to count the number of times a specific digit appears in a range of numbers. I remember that for such problems, it's often useful to break it down by each digit place: units, tens, hundreds, etc., and calculate the occurrences separately for each place.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I should consider the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately for both '4' and '8'.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of '4's in each place.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), the digit '4' appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, the number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks).\n   - So, in each block, there's one '4' in the units place, so 48 times.\n   - But wait, the last block is 481-490, but the book only goes up to 488. So, does this affect the count? Let me see: from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, '4' appears once in the units place here as well (at 484). So, actually, it's 48 complete blocks, each contributing one '4', so 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Now, the tens place. Each '4' in the tens place occurs in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is '4', contributing 10 '4's each.\n   - Let me count how many such blocks there are up to 488.\n   - The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the next is 140-149 (another 10), then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - That's five blocks. Each contributes 10 '4's, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 '4's.\n   - Wait, but does the last block go beyond 488? The block 440-449 ends at 449, which is before 488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, total 50 '4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds place. Here, '4' appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, since the hundreds digit is '4'.\n   - How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - So, each of these 89 numbers has a '4' in the hundreds place, contributing 89 '4's.\n\nNow, adding up all the '4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal '4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct.\n\n**Counting the number of '8's:**\n\nNow, I'll do the same for '8's.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to '4's, in every block of 10 numbers, '8' appears once in the units place.\n   - Number of complete blocks is 48, so 48 '8's from the units place.\n   - But wait, the last block is 481-490, but the book ends at 488. So, in the units place, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so '8' appears once here as well (at 488). So, total '8's in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For the tens place, '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.\n   - Each of these blocks contributes 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - How many such blocks are there up to 488?\n   - The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.\n   - Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last block 480-489 only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is '8' for all of them, right? So, in the tens place, each of these blocks contributes 10 '8's except the last one, which contributes 9 '8's because 489 is beyond 488. Wait, no, 480-489 includes 480 to 489, but since the book only goes to 488, the tens digit '8' appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with '8' in the tens place. So, that's 9 '8's in the tens place for the last block.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The tens digit is '8' in the range 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of these 9 numbers has '8' in the tens place, so 9 '8's.\n\nSo, how many complete blocks do we have? The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 '8's, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 '8's.\n\nSo, total '8's in the tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 '8's. 180-189 is another 10, so 20. 280-289 is 30, 380-389 is 40, and 480-488 is 9, so total 49. That seems correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '8' only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches '8'. Therefore, there are 0 '8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the '8's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal '8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 48 + 49 is indeed 97.\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\n\nNow, the number of '4's is 187, and the number of '8's is 97. So, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my counting.\n\n**Rechecking the '4's:**\n\n- Units place: 48\n  - Since each block of 10 has one '4', and there are 48 blocks (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), so 48 '4's. But wait, in the last block, 481-490, but the book ends at 488, so does that affect the units place? In the units place, 484 is within 481-488, so yes, '4' appears once. So, 48 '4's in units place is correct.\n\n- Tens place: 50\n  - Each block of 100 has a block where the tens digit is '4', e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 '4's. How many such blocks? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, five blocks where the tens digit is '4', each contributing 10 '4's. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n  - From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each has a '4' in the hundreds place. So, 89 '4's. Correct.\n\nTotal '4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Correct.\n\n**Rechecking the '8's:**\n\n- Units place: 48\n  - Each block of 10 has one '8', and there are 48 blocks. The last block, 481-490, but the book ends at 488, so in the units place, '8' appears at 488, which is within 481-488. So, 48 '8's in units place. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 49\n  - The blocks are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n  - Since 800-899 is beyond 488, no '8's in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal '8's: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high, but let me think again. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, another way to check: perhaps I should calculate the number of '4's and '8's separately for each digit place and ensure that I didn't overcount or undercount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small table for each digit place.\n\n**Alternative approach for '4's:**\n\n- Units digit:\n  - From 1 to 488, how many times does '4' appear in the units place?\n  - It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms?\n  - The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10.\n  - Number of terms = ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's 49, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, so this suggests that the number of '4's in the units place is 49, not 48. But earlier, I thought it was 48 because 488 \u00f7 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks. But according to this calculation, it's 49.\n\nWait, let me see: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24,...,484. So, 484 is the last one. So, how many numbers is that?\n\nLet me calculate: 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, so the number of terms is 48 full decades plus one more (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, I was wrong earlier; it's 49 '4's in the units place, not 48.\n\nWait, so that changes things. So, I made a mistake in my initial calculation. The units place for '4's is 49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, let me check for '8's in the units place.\n\n- Units digit for '8's:\n  - From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488.\n  - The last term is 488. So, how many terms?\n  - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, and then one more (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 '8's in the units place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. So, I must have made a mistake there as well.\n\nWait, let me recast this.\n\nFor any digit d in the units place from 1 to N, the number of times d appears is floor((N + 10 - d)/10). Hmm, maybe a better formula.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor((N + 1)/10) if d \u2264 N mod 10, else floor((N + 1)/10).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think as follows:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is floor(N / 10), plus 1 if the units digit of N is >= d.\n\nWait, let me test this with N=488.\n\nFor '4's in units place:\n\n- floor(488 / 10) = 48\n- 488 mod 10 = 8, which is >= 4, so add 1\n- Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nSimilarly, for '8's in units place:\n\n- floor(488 / 10) = 48\n- 488 mod 10 = 8, which is equal to 8, so add 1\n- Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nSo, I was wrong earlier; both '4's and '8's in the units place occur 49 times, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, let me check the tens place.\n\n**Rechecking '4's in the tens place:**\n\n- Tens digit is '4' in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n\nEach of these ranges contributes 10 '4's in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it's cut off.\n\nBut 440-449 is entirely within 1-488, so it's fully included.\n\nSo, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 '4's each = 50 '4's in the tens place. Correct.\n\n**Rechecking '8's in the tens place:**\n\n- Tens digit is '8' in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489.\n\nBut the book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, each of the first four ranges contributes 10 '8's, and the last contributes 9.\n\nSo, total '8's in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 49, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought '8's in tens place were 49, but when I recalculated units place, I found that '4's in units place were 49, '8's in units place were 49, so maybe I should adjust.\n\nWait, let's go step by step.\n\n**Correcting the counts:**\n\n- **'4's:**\n  - Units place: 49\n  - Tens place: 50\n  - Hundreds place: 89\n  - Total '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nWait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\n- **'8's:**\n  - Units place: 49\n  - Tens place: 49\n  - Hundreds place: 0\n  - Total '8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's the same difference as before, but the counts have changed. Wait, no, actually, the counts changed, but the difference remains the same. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nPreviously, '4's were 187, '8's were 97, difference 90.\n\nNow, '4's are 188, '8's are 98, difference 90. So, same difference.\n\nWait, so perhaps the error in the units place didn't affect the difference, but I need to make sure that all counts are correct.\n\nWait, let me recast all the counts with the correct units place.\n\n**Recomputing '4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - As calculated, 49 '4's.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 '4's, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one '4' in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Recomputing '8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - As calculated, 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 '8's, so 4\u00d710=40.\n   - The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, contributing 9 '8's in the tens place.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No '8's, as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so the difference remains 90, but the counts are now 188 and 98. So, I think I made a mistake earlier in the units place counts, which I've now corrected.\n\nWait, but let me check again for '8's in the tens place. The ranges are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 '8's.\n- 180-189: 10 '8's.\n- 280-289: 10 '8's.\n- 380-389: 10 '8's.\n- 480-488: 9 '8's.\n\nSo, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, '4's in the units place: 49, as per the formula.\n\nSo, the correct counts are '4's:188, '8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the difference was 90, but I thought maybe I made a mistake in the units place. But after correcting, it's still 90.\n\nWait, maybe I should try another approach to verify.\n\n**Alternative approach using digit positions:**\n\nLet me consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For '4's: as calculated, 49.\n   - For '8's: as calculated, 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For '4's: 50.\n   - For '8's: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - For '4's: 89.\n   - For '8's: 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n- '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems like a large difference. Let me check with smaller numbers to see if my method works.\n\n**Testing with a smaller number:**\n\nLet's say we have a 20-page book. How many '1's and '2's are there?\n\nPage numbers: 1 to 20.\n\nCounting '1's:\n\n- Units place: 1,11 \u2192 2 times.\n- Tens place: 10-19 \u2192 10 times.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal '1's: 2 + 10 = 12.\n\nCounting '2's:\n\n- Units place: 2,12 \u2192 2 times.\n- Tens place: 20 \u2192 1 time.\nTotal '2's: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nDifference: 12 - 3 = 9.\n\nLet me list the pages and count:\n\nPages 1-20:\n\n- '1's: 1,10-19,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 \u2192 11 times? Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, in units place: 1,11 \u2192 two '1's.\n\nIn tens place: 10-19: each page has '1' in tens place, so 10 times.\n\nSo, total '1's: 12.\n\n'2's:\n\n- Units place: 2,12 \u2192 two '2's.\n- Tens place: 20 \u2192 one '2'.\nTotal '2's: 3.\n\nSo, difference is 12 - 3 = 9. Correct.\n\nUsing the same method:\n\nUnits place '1's: floor(20/10) = 2, since 20 mod 10 = 0, which is less than 1, so 2 '1's in units place.\n\nWait, no, wait: 20 mod 10 is 0, which is less than 1, so units place '1's: floor(20/10) = 2.\n\nSimilarly, units place '2's: floor(20/10) = 2, since 20 mod 10 = 0, which is equal to 2? Wait, no, 20 mod 10 is 0, which is less than 2, so units place '2's: floor(20/10) = 2.\n\nWait, but in reality, units place '2's are at 2 and 12, so two '2's. Correct.\n\nTens place '1's: 10-19, which is 10 pages, so 10 '1's.\n\nTens place '2's: 20, which is 1 page, so 1 '2'.\n\nHundreds place: none, since 20 is less than 100.\n\nSo, '1's: 2 + 10 = 12.\n\n'2's: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nDifference: 9. Correct.\n\nSo, the method works for this small case.\n\nTherefore, applying it to the original problem, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again for '4's.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each has a '4' in the hundreds place, so 89 '4's. Correct.\n\nAnd for '8's, since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches '8', so 0 '8's in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate now. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every block of 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place.\n   - Number of complete blocks: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - However, the last block (481-488) includes 484, so we have 49 '4's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - '4' appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 '4's, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 '4's.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive.\n   - This contributes 89 '4's.\n\nTotal '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of '8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every block of 10 numbers, '8' appears once in the units place.\n   - Number of complete blocks: 48, with the last block (481-488) including 488, so we have 49 '8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - '8' appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 '8's each, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 '8's.\n   - Total '8's in the tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of '4's: 188\n- Number of '8's: 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the problem. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I should consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nI'll start with the digit 4. I'll analyze how many times 4 appears in each place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place for 4:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - To find out how many such blocks there are up to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full blocks and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from the full blocks) plus 1 (since 484 is within the extra 8 numbers). Wait, no, 481-488 includes 484, which is the 4th number in that block, so that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's are 48*1 +1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 4:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - How many such blocks are there up to 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then the next block is 401-488.\n   - For each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So that's 4*10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on. The tens digit 4 would be from 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is less than 499, so 440-449 is fully included in 401-488. So that's another 10.\n   - Wait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers, so does 440-449 fall within that? Yes, because 440 is less than 488. So total tens place 4's are 4*10 +10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 4:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all page numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - So, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place.\n\nUnits place for 4: In each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48*1=48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So total units 4's are 48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nTens place for 4: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So from 1-100: 40-49, 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, 10. 301-400: 340-349, 10. Then 401-488: 440-449, 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place for 8:**\n   - Similar to 4, in each block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1-488, there are 48 full tens and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488).\n   - So, units place 8's: 48*1=48. Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So total units 8's: 48+1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 8:**\n   - In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 4*10=40.\n   - Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 8 would be from 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n   - So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from 1-400) +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 8:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only for page numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8 in the 401-488 block. The tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times 8 in the tens place. So, 40 (from 1-400) +9=49, which is correct.\n\nAnd for the hundreds place, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but since the book is only up to 488, there are none. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 8's are 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nTotal 4's are 188, so the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any 8's in the hundreds place. Since 488 is the last page, and 488 is in the 400-499 range, which is hundreds digit 4, so no 8's there. So, correct.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we calculate the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full tens (480 numbers) and one partial block (481-488), contributing 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full tens and one partial block (481-488), contributing 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full hundreds contributing 40 occurrences, and in 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by understanding how digits are counted in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll need to consider all three cases: units place, tens place, and hundreds place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nI think the best approach is to break down the counting by each digit position separately. That is, count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place, then in the tens place, and then in the hundreds place. Then sum them up for each digit.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - The total number of such blocks from 1 to 488 is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take the integer part, which is 48 complete blocks. Each block contributes 1 four in the units place, so that's 48 fours.\n   - However, we need to check the last partial block. The last page is 488, so the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once more in 484. So, total units place fours are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - The number of such blocks in 488 pages is 4 (since 488 / 100 = 4.88). Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours.\n   - Now, check the last partial block beyond 400. From 400 to 488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding 10 more fours, making the total tens place fours 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, actually, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. But in the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 fours, and we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total tens fours are 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute 1 four in the units place. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 four, so 48 fours. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in 484. So, total units fours are 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\nAdding them up: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to fours, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - Number of complete blocks: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 eight, so 48 eights.\n   - Last partial block: 481-488, units digits 1-8. So, 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place eights are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Number of such blocks in 488 pages: 4 (since 488 / 100 = 4.88). Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights.\n   - Check the last partial block (400-488). The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8. So, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers, but wait, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so 9 numbers. But each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each block contributes 10 eights, but in the last partial block, it's only 9. So, total tens eights are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the eights:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me check again.\n\nUnits place: 49 eights, correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. There are 4 full hundred blocks, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last hundred block (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, correct.\n\nSo total eights are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when counting fours, I got 188 fours, and eights are 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counting again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me recount the fours:\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 four, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), units digits 1-8, so 484 has a 4. So, total units fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. There are 4 full hundred blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last hundred block (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens fours: 40 +10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nNow, for eights:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, 48 full tens, each contributing 1 eight, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit 8 appears once in 488. So, total units eights: 48 +1=49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. 4 full hundred blocks, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last hundred block (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so 9 eights. So, total tens eights: 40 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours minus 98 eights, which is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, 480 is the first number with tens digit 8, and 488 is the last. So, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, that part is correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: For the tens digit, in each hundred block, the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is 10 times, except for the last block where it might be less. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the tens place, in the last hundred block (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. That's correct.\n\nSo, the total fours are 188 and eights are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet me try that.\n\n**Alternative approach for units digit:**\n\nFor any digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor units place:\n- The number of times d appears is (n / 10) * 1 + (if the remainder is >= d, add 1 else 0).\n\nWait, but actually, it's more precise to say:\n\nFor units digit, the count of d from 1 to N is:\n- full_cycles = N // 10\n- remainder = N % 10\n- count = full_cycles * 1\n- if remainder >= d, count +=1\n- but if d is 0, it's a bit different because 0 can't be in the units place for numbers 1 to N.\n\nBut in our case, d is 4 and 8, which are non-zero.\n\nSo, for units digit:\n\nFor 4:\n- full_cycles = 488 //10 =48\n- remainder =488%10=8\n- since 8 >=4, count +=1\n- total units fours:48 +1=49.\n\nFor 8:\n- full_cycles=488//10=48\n- remainder=8\n- since 8>=8, count +=1\n- total units eights:48 +1=49.\n\nThat matches what I had earlier.\n\n**Tens digit:**\n\nFor tens place, the formula is:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10\nremainder = N % 100\nif remainder >= d*10:\n    count += (remainder - d*10 +1)\nelse:\n    count +=0\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nThe number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N is:\n\n- full_cycles = N // 100\n- count = full_cycles * 10\n- remainder = N % 100\n- if remainder >= d*10:\n    count += (remainder - d*10 +1)\n- else:\n    count +=0\n\nSo, for 4 in tens place:\n\nd=4.\n\nfull_cycles=488//100=4\ncount=4*10=40\nremainder=88\nsince 88 >=40 (4*10), count += (88 -40 +1)=49\nWait, that can't be right because 4*10=40, and from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nWait, let's apply it correctly.\n\nFor tens digit, d=4.\n\nfull_cycles =488//100=4\ncount=4*10=40\nremainder=488%100=88\nNow, check if remainder >= d*10=40. 88 >=40, so count += (88 -40 +1)=49? That can't be right because in the last partial hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs only once in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nIf the remainder is >= d*10, then the extra count is (remainder - d*10 +1). But in our case, remainder is 88, which is greater than 40, so the extra count is 88 -40 +1=49. But that would mean 49 more fours in the tens place, which is not correct because in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is not correctly applied here. Let me think differently.\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred block, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9, and for each digit d, it appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 0-9 in tens place for each hundred).\n\nBut in the last partial hundred, if the remainder is less than 100, we need to check how many times d appears in the tens place up to that remainder.\n\nSo, for d=4 in tens place:\n\nfull_cycles=488//100=4\ncount=4*10=40\nremainder=488%100=88\nNow, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit can go up to 8 (since 488 is the last number). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, count +=10.\n\nThus, total tens fours=40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n\nfull_cycles=4\ncount=4*10=40\nremainder=88\nNow, in the last partial hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, count +=9.\n\nThus, total tens eights=40+9=49.\n\nThat's correct.\n\n**Hundreds digit:**\n\nFor hundreds place, d=4:\n\nfull_cycles=488//1000=0\nremainder=488%1000=488\nBut since we're dealing with hundreds digit, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488.\n\nSo, count= (488 -400 +1)=89.\n\nFor d=8 in hundreds place:\n\nSince 488 is less than 800, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, count=0.\n\nSo, total hundreds fours=89, hundreds eights=0.\n\nAdding up:\n\nFours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89 \u2192 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nEights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0 \u2192 49+49=98.\n\nDifference=188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check once more because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate for each digit position separately and ensure consistency.\n\nUnits digit:\n\n- For both 4 and 8, we have 49 occurrences each. That seems correct because in 488 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears roughly the same number of times in the units place, with some adjustment for the last partial set.\n\nTens digit:\n\n- For 4, we have 50 occurrences, and for 8, 49. That makes sense because in the last partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, the total is 188 fours and 98 eights, difference of 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to solve this step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to find out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Finally, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me break it down by the places where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each digit separately.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's a 4 in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.). So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the total number of complete groups of 10 in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. However, wait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers. In each complete group, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. But in the partial group from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total units place 4's are 48.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 is the last digit. So, from 1 to 488, the last digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many tens are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. Since 481 ends with 1, and the next would be 484, but wait, 484 is within 481-488? Let's check: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 484 is in this group, so that's another 4 in the units place. So, actually, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, and then the remaining 8 numbers in the 49th group (481-488). In these 8 numbers, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but actually, when you have 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, so the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place, 4 appears once here, so total units place 4's are 48 (from the first 480 pages) plus 1, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the 484 in the 49th group, so 49. Yes, that seems right.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of the first 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So, in this range, the tens digit 4 appears how many times? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488, right? 440 is 440, and 449 is 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's are 40 (from the first 4 hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check: 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So yes, 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yes.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8.\n\nI'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place**: How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1 to 488?\n\nSimilar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Now, the remaining 8 numbers in the 49th group (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: How many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nAgain, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so 8 appears 10 times per hundred.\n\nThere are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit goes up to 8, so from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers: 480-488, but wait, 480 is 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 only when the tens place is 8, so from 480 to 489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. How many numbers have 8 in the tens place here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 480 is part of the 401-488 range, right? So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). So, adding that to the previous 40, we get 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 401-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nThe hundreds digit is 8 only when the number is from 800 to 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800 onwards, which is beyond 488, so yes, 0 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. When I calculated the tens place for 4's, I considered 401-488 and said that the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449). But 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 10 times there, plus 40 from the first 4 hundreds, totaling 50. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. Plus 40 from the first 4 hundreds, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8's again. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place, same logic: 48 full groups, 48 times, plus 484 in the last group, so 49. Correct.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is the last page, so when calculating the units place for 4's, the last group is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's one more 4. So, 49 units place 4's. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, the last group includes 488, which is an 8, so 49 units place 8's. Correct.\n\nNow, let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, hundreds place is 0, as we don't reach 800. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 98\nDifference: 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I need to solve this step by step, so let me think it through carefully.\n\nFirst, I know that each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and each number is printed once. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll need to consider all three places: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the counting of 4's and 8's into each digit place separately. That is, count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place, then in the tens place, and then in the hundreds place. Then, sum them up for each digit and find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the digit 4 appears once (at 4).\n   - This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. So, for each set of 10 consecutive numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place.\n   - The total number of page numbers is 488, so the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). But wait, actually, the number of complete tens is 48 because 48*10 = 480, and then we have 8 more pages (481 to 488).\n   - So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from each group of 10) plus one more if the remaining pages (481-488) include a 4 in the units place.\n   - Looking at 481-488: The units digits are 1 to 8. 4 is present at 484. So, that's one more.\n   - So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers. Specifically, from 40 to 49, the tens digit is 4 for each number, so that's 10 times.\n   - This pattern repeats every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, 40-49: 10 times.\n   - In 101-200, 140-149: another 10 times.\n   - Similarly, in 201-300, 240-249: 10 times.\n   - In 301-400, 340-349: 10 times.\n   - Now, from 401-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 times.\n   - So, how many complete hundreds are there? From 1-400, there are four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n   - Then, in 401-488, we have another 10 from 440-449.\n   - So total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - But wait, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - However, wait, 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, each of these 89 numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to counting the 8's.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 48 complete groups (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more pages (481-488).\n   - So, in each group of 10, there's one 8 in the units place, so 48 times.\n   - Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (at 488).\n   - So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, 8 appears in blocks of 100. Specifically, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in the range 80-89, which is 10 numbers.\n   - So, in 1-100: 80-89: 10 times.\n   - In 101-200: 180-189: 10 times.\n   - In 201-300: 280-289: 10 times.\n   - In 301-400: 380-389: 10 times.\n   - Now, in 401-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488).\n   - So, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488, but only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page).\n   - Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 times.\n   - So, total 8's in tens place:\n     - From 1-400: 4 sets of 10 (each hundred contributes 10), so 4*10=40.\n     - From 401-488: 9 times.\n     - So total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Wait, but 401-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my counts because 188 seems high for 4's.\n\nWait, when I counted the 4's in the units place, I had 49. Let me confirm that.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So total 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). From 1-400, there are four such hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49, as each 10 contributes one 8, and the last 8 pages include 488, so one more.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is included). So 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThus, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 4's in the hundreds place are 89, which is a lot. Let me think: from 400 to 488, each of those 89 pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but 488 - 400 + 1 = 89, so yes, 89 numbers.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 400 is included, so 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So 89 numbers. So 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, as 488 is included. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, but we include both endpoints, so 9 numbers. So, 9 times 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me just verify once more to be sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe using a formula.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(N / 10)\nRemaining numbers: N % 10\nIf remaining >= d, add 1, else add 0.\n\nSimilarly for tens and hundreds places, but scaled up.\n\nWait, maybe I can use this formula to confirm.\n\nLet's compute the number of 4's in each place:\n\nUnits place:\n\nN = 488\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488 / 10) = 48\nRemaining numbers: 488 % 10 = 8\nSince 8 >= 4, add 1.\nTotal 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor tens place, we consider groups of 100. The digit in the tens place is d in the range x0 + d*10 to x0 + (d+1)*10 -1, for each hundred.\n\nThe formula for the number of times digit d appears in the tens place up to N is:\n\nnumber = (N // 100) * 10\nremainder = N % 100\nif remainder >= (d*10 + 10):\n    number += 10\nelif remainder >= (d*10):\n    number += (remainder - (d*10) + 1)\nelse:\n    number += 0\n\nWait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 every 100 numbers, so for each hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 4's in the tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (since 4*100 = 400)\nSo, 4*10 = 40.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4, so 4*10 = 40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nFor 8's, there are no hundreds digits of 8, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n### Counting the number of 4's:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 4's.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one 4 (at 484).\n   - Total 4's in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - From 1-400, there are four such hundreds, contributing \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\) 4's.\n   - In 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, contributing 10 more 4's.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: \\(40 + 10 = 50\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400 to 488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal number of 4's: \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\).\n\n### Counting the number of 8's:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 8's.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one 8 (at 488).\n   - Total 8's in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - From 1-400, there are four such hundreds, contributing \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\) 8's.\n   - In 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, contributing 9 more 8's.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: \\(40 + 9 = 49\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal number of 8's: \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\).\n\n### Difference:\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\(188 - 98 = 90\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to calculate the total number of 4's that appear in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the number 8's. Finally, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me break it down by the digits' places: units, tens, and hundreds. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll consider each digit position separately for both 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with the number of 4's:\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** \n   - Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, there are 488 / 10 = 48 full groups of 10. That gives 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is actually 48.8, which means there's an extra 8 in the units place beyond the 48 full groups. However, since we're only counting 4's, the extra 8 doesn't affect the count. So, 48 times 1 is 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, each of these 10 numbers has a 4 in the tens place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). That's 4 times 10 = 40 occurrences. But wait, 488 is beyond 400, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 400-409 and 410-419, etc., but actually, the tens digit is 0 in 400-409, 1 in 410-419, and so on. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct that. The tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only once, from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. So, actually, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 4 times 10 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 440-449), totaling 50. Wait, no, that's not right because from 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in each hundred block once, so 4 times 10, which is 40, and then from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10. So total is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's are 187.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of 8's.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full groups, so 48 occurrences. But wait, the last group is 480-488, which includes 9 numbers, so the units digit 8 appears once in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in units place is floor(488/10) + (if the last number's units digit is >=8, add 1). So, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, and then in 480-488, 8 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). From 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds. Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I calculated 4's, I got 187, and 8's as 98, so the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But let me double-check the 8's calculation because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 8's, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's list them:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, the tens place is correct at 49.\n\nUnits place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in units place, so 48 full tens (1-480) and then 481-488, which includes 8 in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, 4's are 187, 8's are 98. Difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187. Let me check that again.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, and then in 480-488, 484 is the only 4 in units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, because in the units place, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So from 1-480, that's 480 numbers, so 480 / 10 = 48 times. Then, from 481-488, 484 is the only 4 in units place, so 1 more. So units place for 4's is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate 4's correctly.\n\nUnits place for 4's:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 4 is in the units digit, which is every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, and then in the last partial group (481-488), 484 is the only one, so 1 more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place for 4's:\n\nEvery 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.). From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place for 4's:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, earlier I had 187, but now it's 188. Let me check again.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full groups (1-480) gives 48, plus 484 in 481-488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40, plus 440-449 in 400-488, which is 10, so 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, we had 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the units place for 4's: from 1-488, how many 4's in units place?\n\nIt's the number of times 4 appears in units digit, which is every 10 numbers. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last group, 481-488, 484 is the only one with 4 in units place, so 1 more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place for 4's: every 100 numbers, 10 times. From 1-400, that's 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, 440-449 is 10, so 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups (1-480) gives 48, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400) gives 4*10=40, plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small table to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (if 488 mod 10 >=4, add 1). So, floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10=8 >=4, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod10=8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, check the last partial hundred: 400-488. The tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total 40 +10=50.\n\nNumber of 8's in tens place: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: if the hundreds digit is 4, then from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nNumber of 8's: 0, since 488 <800.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I need to solve this step by step, so let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a number from 1 to 488, and each digit in these numbers contributes to the count of 4's and 8's. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference between these two counts.\n\nI remember that when counting digits, it's helpful to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll need to consider the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\n**1. Counting the number of 4's and 8's in the units place:**\n\nFor the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in the range from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and a partial group of 8 numbers (481 to 488).\n\nIn each complete group of 10, the digit in the units place is 4 exactly once (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 474) and 8 exactly once (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 478). So, for each complete group, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's in the units place from the complete groups is 48, and similarly, the number of 8's is also 48.\n\nNow, let's look at the partial group from 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in this partial group, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, adding these to the previous counts, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, it's 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check that again. The partial group is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, 4 and 8 each appear once. So the counts are correct.\n\n**2. Counting the number of 4's and 8's in the tens place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place within each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 (10 numbers), and 8 for 80-89 (10 numbers).\n\nSo, let's see how many complete hundreds are there in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and 8 exactly 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each complete hundred, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSince there are 4 complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and the same for 8's, it's 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the partial hundred is from 401 to 488. Let's break this down further. The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the upper limit). So, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, each appearing 10 times except for the last partial cycle.\n\nWait, actually, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 only appears from 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The tens digit is determined by the second digit from the right. So, for 401-488, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except for the last one, which only goes up to 88, which is 488.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., 8 (481-490). But 490 is beyond 488, so the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, which is 8 numbers: 481-488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in this partial hundred.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, actually, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times in each hundred. But in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit 8 would normally go from 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480 is included, right? 480 is part of 401-488.\n\nWait, actually, 480 is within 401-488, so the tens digit 8 starts at 480. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 480 is included because 480 is less than 488. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit 4 in the partial hundred, how many times does it appear? The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, but wait, 440 is included, so yes, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact counts.\n\nIn the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420 \u2192 10 numbers\n- ...\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, for the tens digit 4, it occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFor the tens digit 8, it occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding this to the complete hundreds:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 4 complete hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the partial \u2192 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 4 complete hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the partial \u2192 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's: 49.\n\n**3. Counting the number of 4's and 8's in the hundreds place:**\n\nNow, the hundreds place. Each page number from 1-488 has a hundreds digit of 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488).\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nWait, 488 - 400 is 88, so plus 1 is 89. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWhat about the hundreds digit 8? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The highest hundreds digit is 4. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\n**4. Summarizing the counts:**\n\nNow, let's add up the counts for each digit place.\n\n- **Units place:**\n  - 4's: 49\n  - 8's: 49\n\n- **Tens place:**\n  - 4's: 50\n  - 8's: 49\n\n- **Hundreds place:**\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n\nSo, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check the addition again.\n\nWait, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) = 188. That seems correct for 4's.\n\nFor 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98, correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then the partial group 481-488 has one 4 (484) and one 8 (488), so total 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then the partial hundred 401-488: 440-449 is 10 4's, and 480-488 is 9 8's. So, total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's, and 0 8's. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just think again if I missed anything.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately and sum them up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a formula for digit counting.\n\nI remember that for each digit place, the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated using a formula based on higher digits, current digit, and lower digits.\n\nBut since I've already done the step-by-step count, and it seems consistent, I think 90 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 in all of them, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nAnd for 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages numbered 800-899, so 0 8's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, in the partial hundred, the 8's appear 9 times because from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place in the partial hundred. So, total 8's in tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, 4's in the tens place in the partial hundred are 10, so total 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48*10 gives 48 groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8, plus the partial group 481-488, which adds one 4 and one 8. So, 49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Complete groups of 10: 48 groups (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Each group contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8'.\n   - Partial group (481-488): '4' appears once (484), '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total '4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488):\n     - '4' in tens place: 440-449 (10 times).\n     - '8' in tens place: 480-488 (9 times).\n   - Total '4's: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in 400-488: 89 times.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place (book ends at 488).\n   - Total '4's: 89.\n   - Total '8's: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8 and subtract the two to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. \n\nI think it's best to break this down by the number of digits: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's 4; from 11-20, it's 14; and so on. \n\n   Since the book has 488 pages, the number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks). Each block contributes 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last partial block is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. In this block, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units place 4s are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Similarly, for the tens place, 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, in each block of 100, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\n   How many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each block contributes 10 times 4 in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. \n\n   Now, the partial block from 401-488. In this range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 occurrences. So, total tens place 4s are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding all these up for 4s: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Hmm, units place was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. So 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4, for every block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial block from 481-488: the units digit 8 is at 488, which is one occurrence. So, units place 8s: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: For the tens digit, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8. \n\n   There are 4 complete blocks of 100, so 4 * 10 = 40. \n\n   Now, the partial block from 401-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 occurrences. Therefore, total tens place 8s: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. Thus, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up for 8s: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Units: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last block where 488 contributes 1, so 49. Tens: 4 blocks of 100, each 10, so 40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488), so 9. So 40 + 9 = 49. Hundreds: 0. So total 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4s and 8s is 188 (for 4s) minus 98 (for 8s), which is 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nWait, for the hundreds place of 4s, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the tens place of 4s, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Plus, in each block of 100 before that, from 40-49 in each hundred, so 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. So total tens place 4s: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nUnits place for 4s: Each block of 10 contributes 1, so 48 full blocks, 48, plus in 481-488, 484 is the only one with units digit 4, so 1. So total 49.\n\nSo 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8s:\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks, 48, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 blocks of 100, each 10, so 40, plus in 401-488, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8s: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the tens place in 401-488. The tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So yes, 9 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear? For each 10, once, so 48 times, plus the 488, which is another 1, so 49.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4s is 188, and the number of 8s is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but wait a second, let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, when considering both units and tens, does any number get counted twice? No, because each digit is in a separate place. So, for example, 444 would have three 4s, each counted in units, tens, and hundreds. So, the total count is correct.\n\nSimilarly, 488 has two 8s, but in different places, so each is counted separately.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

The difference here is 0.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in both places.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 40-49. That's 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- The digit 8 appears in the tens place for pages 80-89. That's another 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears once every ten numbers, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times because from 10-99, each ten has one 4 in the units place, but 44 has two 4's. Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me count them properly.\n\nActually, from 10 to 99, for each ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 tens (10-99), so 9 times for 4 in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears once in each ten in the units place, so 9 times for 8.\n\nWait, but when I'm counting the units place for 4, from 10-99, each ten has a 4 in the units place, so that's 9 times (14,24,...,94). Similarly, for 8, it's 9 times (18,28,...,98).\n\nBut wait, 44 is included in the units place count, but in the tens place, 44 is already counted as a 4 in the tens place. So, in the units place, 44 contributes one more 4. So, for units place, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers:\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- Units place: 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n- Total for 4 in two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n- Total for 8 in two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each, so the difference here is 0.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number has hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nI think I'll need to break this down by each digit place separately: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, let's note that the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book goes up to 488.\n\nBut since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, but when hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, and the units digit goes from 0 to 9, except when the tens digit is 8, where the units digit can only go up to 8.\n\nThis might complicate things a bit, but perhaps I can handle it by considering the hundreds digit as 1, 2, 3, or 4, and then for each, count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate for each digit place (hundreds, tens, units) separately, how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, hundreds place:\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4 or 8 here.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4 or 8 here.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4 or 8 here.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), so 89 times for 4 in the hundreds place. For 8, the hundreds digit is 4, so 8 doesn't appear here.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times.\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, tens place:\nWe need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place from 100 to 488.\n\nLet me break this down by each hundred:\n\n1. 100-199:\n   The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for pages 140-149, which is 10 times. Similarly, it's 8 for pages 180-189, which is another 10 times.\n\n2. 200-299:\n   Similarly, tens digit 4 appears in 240-249 (10 times), and 8 appears in 280-289 (10 times).\n\n3. 300-399:\n   Tens digit 4 appears in 340-349 (10 times), and 8 appears in 380-389 (10 times).\n\n4. 400-488:\n   Here, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since the last page is 488). So, for tens digit 4: pages 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 pages, so 10 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\n   For tens digit 8: pages 480-488. Wait, the tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFor 4 in the tens place:\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 10\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place:\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct because in 400-488, the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, so only 9 pages.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place for three-digit numbers:\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. 100-199:\n   The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each ten (e.g., 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once. There are 10 tens in 100-199, so 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n\n2. 200-299:\n   Similarly, 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\n3. 300-399:\n   Same as above, 10 times each.\n\n4. 400-488:\n   Now, this is from 400 to 488. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\n   For each ten in 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9, except when the tens digit is 8, where it only goes up to 8.\n\n   So, let's see:\n\n   - From 400-479: There are 8 tens (40-47), each with 10 units. So, for each ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 8 tens \u00d7 1 = 8 times each for 4 and 8.\n\n   - Then, from 480-488: The units digit goes from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so units digits go up to 8.\n\n   Wait, let me count more carefully.\n\n   From 400-488, the units digit for each ten:\n\n   - For tens digits 0-7 (i.e., 400-479): Each ten has 10 units, so 4 appears once in each ten, so 8 tens \u00d7 1 = 8 times. Similarly, 8 appears once in each ten, so 8 times.\n\n   - For tens digit 8 (480-488): Units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, that's 1 each.\n\n   So, total in 400-488:\n\n   - 4 in units place: 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n   - 8 in units place: 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up across all hundreds:\n\nFor 4 in units place:\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nFor 8 in units place:\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 each appear 39 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the occurrences for 4 and 8 across all digit places.\n\nStarting with 4:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 (as calculated above)\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nNow for 8:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39 (from 100-488)\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 168, and the number of 8's is 78. The difference is 168 - 78 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, let's verify the hundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 each contribute 10, and 400-488 contributes 10, so 40. Correct.\n\n- For 8: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 each contribute 10, and 400-488 contributes 9, so 39. Correct.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 4: Each hundred (100-199, etc.) contributes 10, so 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30, plus 9 from 400-488, totaling 39. Correct.\n\n- For 8: Similarly, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30, plus 9 from 400-488, totaling 39. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nTotal 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nDifference: 168 - 78 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - Total for two-digit pages:\n     - 4's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n     - 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n     - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 40 times (10-399: 10 each hundred, 400-488: 10).\n     - 8 appears 39 times (10-399: 10 each hundred, 400-488: 9).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4 appears 39 times (10-399: 10 each hundred, 400-488: 9).\n     - 8 appears 39 times (10-399: 10 each hundred, 400-488: 9).\n   - Total for three-digit pages:\n     - 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n     - 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n   - Difference: 168 - 78 = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."
