    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm going to think out loud here, so maybe I'll make some mistakes, but I'll correct them as I go along.\n\nFirst, I know that each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and each number is printed once. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach this by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That might make it easier to count without missing any numbers.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers, right? So, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nWait, but actually, since 488 isn't a multiple of 10, the distribution might not be perfectly even. Let me think about this. The number of times each digit appears in the units place can be calculated by considering how many complete groups of 10 there are, and then adding any extra numbers beyond that.\n\nSo, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Each group of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). So, in each complete group of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Therefore, for 48 complete groups, that's 48 fours and 48 eights.\n\nNow, for the extra 8 numbers (481-488), let's check the units digits. The units digits here are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in this range, the units digit is 4 once and 8 once. So, adding that to the previous count, the total for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because 488 is the last number, so maybe I should check the exact count again. Let me recount. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of times a number ends with 4. So, starting from 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there?\n\nWell, the first occurrence is 4, and the last is 484. The difference between 484 and 4 is 480, and since each step is 10, the number of terms is 480 / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, that's 49 fours in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last term is 488, so the difference is 488 - 8 = 480, so number of terms is 480 / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\nOkay, so units place gives us 49 fours and 49 eights. So, no difference there.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, ..., 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 numbers.\n\nSo, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 400 is 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Then, we have 88 more numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred). Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89 in each hundred).\n\nSo, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours and 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). Wait, no, 401-410: tens digit is 0; 411-420: tens digit is 1; ...; 481-490: tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers.\n\nWait, so in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here?\n\nLet me think: in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 when the numbers are 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, but wait, 480 is included, so that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but perhaps I made a mistake in how I'm counting.\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let me check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this range.\n\nFor the tens digit being 4: numbers from 440 to 449. But 440 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 10 fours.\n\nFor the tens digit being 8: numbers from 480 to 489. But since we're only going up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place for 401-488, we have 10 fours and 9 eights.\n\nSo, total in the tens place:\n\n40 fours (from 1-400) + 10 fours (from 401-488) = 50 fours.\n\n40 eights (from 1-400) + 9 eights (from 401-488) = 49 eights.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the tens place, 4's occur 50 times, and 8's occur 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are more than 8's by 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case, since the book has 488 pages.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears as follows:\n\n- 1 appears in 100-199: 100 times.\n- 2 appears in 200-299: 100 times.\n- 3 appears in 300-399: 100 times.\n- 4 appears in 400-488: 89 times (since 488 is the last number).\n\nWait, so from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nNow, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? 89 times.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be where 8 appears in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, now, let me summarize:\n\n- Units place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n- Tens place: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n- Hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nNow, let's add them up.\n\nTotal fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of fours is 188, and the total number of eights is 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's a 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), there's a 4 in 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 fours. Similarly, 8's in the units place: same logic, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and in the remaining 8 numbers, 488 has an 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights. So, units place: 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400: each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, 4*10=40 fours, 4*10=40 eights.\n\nFrom 401-488: tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, 440-449: 10 fours, and 480-488: 9 eights.\n\nSo, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nAnd since the book doesn't go beyond 488, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights there.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I overcounted in the tens place? Because in 401-488, when I counted 440-449 as 10 fours in the tens place, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. Similarly, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, another way to think about the tens place: in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 401-488, that's 88 numbers. The tens digits cycle every 10 numbers, so for each tens digit, there are 10 numbers except possibly the last partial group.\n\nWait, 88 divided by 10 is 8.8, so 8 full groups of 10, and 8 extra numbers.\n\nWait, but in reality, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for the last one, which appears 9 times because 488 is the end.\n\nWait, so for tens digits in 401-488:\n\n- 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- 1: 10 times (411-420)\n- 2: 10 times (421-430)\n- 3: 10 times (431-440)\n- 4: 10 times (441-450)\n- 5: 10 times (451-460)\n- 6: 10 times (461-470)\n- 7: 10 times (471-480)\n- 8: 9 times (481-488)\n\nWait, so in this case, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 9 times (481-488). So, that's correct. So, in the tens place for 401-488, 10 fours and 9 eights.\n\nSo, in the tens place overall, 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50 fours, and 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 1-488, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears there. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding it all up, I get 188 fours and 98 eights, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using a formula or a more systematic counting method.\n\nI remember that for digit counting problems, you can break down each digit place and calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nFor a given digit place (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated using the formula:\n\ncount = higher * current_place + lower + adjust\n\nWhere higher is the number formed by the digits higher than the current place, lower is the number formed by the digits lower than the current place, and adjust is based on the current digit.\n\nWait, maybe that's a bit too abstract. Let me try to apply it for each digit place.\n\nLet's start with the units place.\n\nFor units place, the digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\nnumber_of_4s_units = (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >= 4 else 0)\n\nSimilarly for 8:\n\nnumber_of_8s_units = (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >= 8 else 0)\n\nWait, but let's test this with N=488.\n\nFor units digit 4:\n\nnumber_of_4s_units = 488 // 10 = 48, and since 488 % 10 = 8 >= 4, so +1, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8:\n\nnumber_of_8s_units = 488 // 10 = 48, and since 488 % 10 = 8 >= 8, so +1, total 49.\n\nThat matches our earlier count.\n\nNow, for the tens place.\n\nThe formula is a bit more involved. For the tens place, each digit d appears in blocks of 100. So, for each complete hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Then, for the remaining numbers beyond the complete hundreds, we calculate how many times the digit appears.\n\nSo, for the tens place, the number of times 4 appears can be calculated as:\n\nhigher = N // 100\ncurrent = (N // 10) % 10\nlower = N % 10\n\nif current > 4:\n    count = (higher + 1) * 10\nelif current == 4:\n    count = higher * 10 + lower + 1\nelse:\n    count = higher * 10\n\nSimilarly for 8:\n\nif current > 8:\n    count = (higher + 1) * 10\nelif current == 8:\n    count = higher * 10 + lower + 1\nelse:\n    count = higher * 10\n\nWait, but let me apply this to N=488.\n\nFor tens digit 4:\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 = 4\ncurrent = (488 // 10) % 10 = 8 % 10 = 8\nlower = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSince current (8) > 4, the count would be (4 + 1) * 10 = 50.\n\nWait, that's 50 fours in the tens place, which matches our earlier count.\n\nFor tens digit 8:\n\nhigher = 4\ncurrent = 8\nlower = 8\n\nSince current (8) > 8 is false, and current == 8, so count = higher * 10 + lower + 1 = 4*10 + 8 + 1 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWhich also matches our earlier count.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place, the formula is similar.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4:\n\nhigher = N // 1000 = 0\ncurrent = (N // 100) % 10 = 4\nlower = N % 100 = 88\n\nSince current == 4, count = higher * 100 + (lower + 1) if lower >= 0 else higher * 100.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the hundreds place, since 800 > 488, it doesn't appear, so 0 times.\n\nSo, applying the formula:\n\nFor hundreds digit 4:\n\nhigher = 488 // 1000 = 0\ncurrent = (488 // 100) % 10 = 4\nlower = 488 % 100 = 88\n\nIf current > 4: no\nIf current == 4: count = higher * 100 + lower + 1 = 0 + 88 + 1 = 89\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nFor hundreds digit 8:\n\nhigher = 0\ncurrent = 4\nlower = 88\n\nSince current < 8, count = higher * 100 = 0.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, using this formula approach, we get:\n\n- Units place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n- Tens place: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n- Hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So, the final answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of fours printed exceeds the number of eights by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting Fours and Eights in Each Digit Place:**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - From 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial group.\n     - Number of fours: 49 (appears once every 10 numbers, with an extra in 484).\n     - Number of eights: 49 (appears once every 10 numbers, with an extra in 488).\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each hundred block contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n     - From 1-400: 40 fours, 40 eights.\n     - From 401-488: 10 fours (440-449), 9 eights (480-488).\n     - Total: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - Fours appear in 400-488: 89 times.\n     - Eights do not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n     - Total: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n2. **Summing Up the Counts:**\n   - Total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours.\n\n**Answer:** The number of fours printed exceeds the number of eights by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let me break this down step by step. Maybe I should consider each digit place separately, like units, tens, hundreds, and so on, and count how many times each digit appears. \n\nFirst, let me think about the digits in each place. For a 488-page book, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the digits can be in the units place, tens place, or hundreds place. I should consider each place separately because the frequency of each digit can vary depending on the position.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each of these 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 48 times in the units place. Now, looking at the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (484), and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, in total, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, for the units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), and so on up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred block.\n\nBut wait, our book goes up to 488, so we have four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is 488, so the hundreds go up to 400, and then 401-488 is another 88 pages.\n\nSo, for each hundred block, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.). Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place in each hundred block (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo, how many hundred blocks do we have? From 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400: that's four blocks. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40 times for 4. Similarly, 8 appears 4 x 10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, in the last block, 301-400, the tens digits go from 0 to 9, so 340-349 would have 4 in the tens place, and 380-389 would have 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct, 10 each per block.\n\nNow, what about the last partial block, 401-488? The tens digit in this block starts at 0 (for 401-410), then 1 (411-420), up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, but wait, 401-488 is from 401 onwards, so 440-449 would be within this block. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times here as well (440-449). Similarly, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this last partial block.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The last block is 401-488. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, which is 8 numbers (481-488). So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 times? Wait, no. Let me count: from 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488. That's 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488), so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this last block.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the last block (440-449), and the digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, adding up, for the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: 4 blocks x 10 = 40, plus 10 in the last block = 50 times.\n- Digit 8: 4 blocks x 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last block = 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (if we consider it, but page numbers don't have leading zeros, so maybe we shouldn't count those). From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 appears in the hundreds place? Well, from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 48 full blocks of 10: 48 x 1 = 48\n- Last 8 numbers: 481-488, units digits include 4 once (484) and 8 once (488)\nTotal units for 4: 49\nTotal units for 8: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4 blocks of 100: 4 x 10 = 40 for 4, same for 8\n- Last block 401-488:\n  - Tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers\n  - Tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers\nSo, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4\n40 + 9 = 49 for 8\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 for 4\n- 8 in hundreds place: 0\n\nAdding up:\n4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nAnd for the tens place in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, the total for 8 in the tens place is 4 blocks x10 = 40, plus 9 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the tens place, 4 blocks x10 =40, plus 10 in the last block (440-449), so 50.\n\nUnits place: both 4 and 8 have 49 each.\n\nSo, the totals are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. Do we count the hundreds digit for 400-488 as 89 times? Because from 400 to 488, each page number has a hundreds digit of 4, so yes, that's 89 times.\n\nAnd for the tens place in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. And the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we determine the counts for each digit.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total full blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - 4 appears 48 times, 8 appears 48 times.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Total full blocks of 100 in 488 pages: 4.\n   - 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 40 times.\n   - Last block (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 times for 4.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 times for 8.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm going to think out loud and see if I can figure this out correctly.\n\nFirst, I know that each page number is printed once, from 1 to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are arranged in page numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, the first few pages are single-digit (1-9), then two-digit (10-99), then three-digit (100-488). Maybe I should break down the counting based on these ranges.\n\nFirst, let's consider the single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear once, right? So, in single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appear once. So, count_4_single = 1, count_8_single = 1.\n\nNow, moving on to two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place, and do the same for 8.\n\nStarting with the tens place for 4: The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place for 4: In two-digit numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each ten's place, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 ten's places (10-99), so 9 times. Wait, but from 10-99, there are 9 ten's groups (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). So, 4 appears once in each group's units place, so 9 times. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in two-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nUnits place: 8 appears once in each ten's group, so 9 times (from 18, 28, ..., 98). So, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nWait, so in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. So, so far, in single and two-digit pages, 4 and 8 each have 1 + 19 = 20, and same for 8: 1 + 19 = 20. So, so far, they're equal.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because now we have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let me think about how to count the 4's and 8's here.\n\nFirst, let's break down the three-digit numbers into their components: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nI think I should count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place (hundreds, tens, units) separately.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place:\n\nFor three-digit numbers from 100 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4, but 400-488 is part of the range.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's here.\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's here.\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's here.\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, 8's in the hundreds place: Since the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, there are no 8's in the hundreds place in any three-digit numbers up to 488. So, count_8_hundreds = 0.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor the tens place, 4 and 8 can appear in the tens digit. Let's consider each hundred block separately.\n\n1. 100-199:\n   - Tens digit can be 0-9. So, 4 appears in the tens place for 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 8 appears in 180-189, which is 10 numbers.\n   So, count_4_tens_100_199 = 10\n   count_8_tens_100_199 = 10\n\n2. 200-299:\n   - Similarly, 4 appears in 240-249, 10 numbers.\n   - 8 appears in 280-289, 10 numbers.\n   So, count_4_tens_200_299 = 10\n   count_8_tens_200_299 = 10\n\n3. 300-399:\n   - 4 appears in 340-349, 10 numbers.\n   - 8 appears in 380-389, 10 numbers.\n   So, count_4_tens_300_399 = 10\n   count_8_tens_300_399 = 10\n\n4. 400-488:\n   - Tens digit here can be 0-8, since 488 is the last number. So, let's see:\n     - For 4 in the tens place: 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, 440 is within 400-488, so 440-449 is 10 numbers.\n     - For 8 in the tens place: 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 400-488.\n\nWait, so in 400-488, 4 in tens place: 10 times, 8 in tens place: 9 times.\n\nSo, total count for tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\ncount_4_tens = 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40\ncount_8_tens = 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, but only up to 488. So, for 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place there.\n\nSo, total for tens place in three-digit numbers: 40 for 4's, 39 for 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds.\n\n1. 100-199:\n   - For each ten's group (100-109, 110-119, ..., 190-199), the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each ten's group, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once. There are 10 ten's groups, so 10 times each.\n   So, count_4_units_100_199 = 10\n   count_8_units_100_199 = 10\n\n2. 200-299:\n   - Same logic: 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n   So, count_4_units_200_299 = 10\n   count_8_units_200_299 = 10\n\n3. 300-399:\n   - Similarly, 10 times each.\n   So, count_4_units_300_399 = 10\n   count_8_units_300_399 = 10\n\n4. 400-488:\n   - Now, here, the units digit can go from 0-9, but we have to check how many complete ten's groups there are and if the last group is incomplete.\n   - The range is 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, how many complete ten's groups are there? 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, from 400 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not a full ten.\n\n   So, for 4 in the units place:\n   - In each ten's group, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 full ten's groups (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) and then 480-488, which is the tenth group but only 9 numbers.\n   - So, in each of the 9 full groups, 4 appears once, so 9 times. In 480-488, does 484 exist? Yes, so that's one more. So total 9 + 1 = 10 times.\n\n   Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, 484 is within this range, so 4 appears once in the units place here.\n\n   Similarly, for 8 in the units place:\n   - In each ten's group, 8 appears once. There are 9 full ten's groups (400-409, ..., 470-479), each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 9 times. Then, in 480-488, 488 is included, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, total 9 + 1 = 10 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 has 9 numbers, so units digits from 0 to 8. So, 8 appears once in each ten's group, including 480-488, so that's 10 ten's groups? Wait, no, 400-409 is the first, then up to 480-488, which is the ninth group because 400-409 is group 1, 410-419 group 2, ..., 480-488 is group 9, because 480 + 10 = 490, which is beyond 488. So, there are 9 ten's groups in 400-488.\n\nWait, but 400-409 is group 1, 410-419 group 2, ..., 480-488 is group 9. So, 9 groups. So, in each group, 8 appears once in the units place, so 9 times. Then, in 480-488, 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place, making it 10 times. Hmm, but wait, 480-488 is group 9, so when I count each group, I've already included 488 in the units place count. Wait, maybe I'm overcounting.\n\nWait, no, because in 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, so 8 appears once in the units place here. So, for 400-488, 4 appears 10 times in the units place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 8 appears once in the units place. So, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times in the units place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nWait, but that seems conflicting with my earlier thought where I thought 8 appears 9 times. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-examine:\n\nIn 400-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nEach ten's group (like 400-409) has exactly one number with 8 in the units place: 408. Similarly, 418, 428, ..., up to 488.\n\nSo, how many such numbers are there?\n\nFrom 400 to 488, the ten's digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for each ten's digit (0,1,2,...,8), there's an 8 in the units place. So, that's 9 times (for ten's digits 0 to 8). But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 9th occurrence. So, 8 appears 9 times in the units place in 400-488.\n\nWait, but 400-409: 408\n410-419: 418\n...\n480-488: 488\n\nSo, that's 9 times, right? Because 400-409 is the first group, and 480-488 is the ninth group, so 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the units place in 400-488:\n\n404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times, right? Wait, but 404 is in 400-409, 414 in 410-419, ..., 484 in 480-488. So, that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 appears 10 times, but now I'm seeing 9 times. Hmm, perhaps I was wrong before.\n\nWait, let's count:\n\n400-409: 404\n410-419: 414\n420-429: 424\n430-439: 434\n440-449: 444\n450-459: 454\n460-469: 464\n470-479: 474\n480-488: 484\n\nThat's 9 times. So, 4 appears 9 times in the units place in 400-488.\n\nWait, so maybe I was wrong before when I thought it was 10 times. So, in 400-488, 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and 8 appears 9 times as well.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488 is included, so 488 would have an 8 in the units place, making it 9 times for 8's. Similarly, 484 is included, making it 9 times for 4's.\n\nSo, in 400-488:\n\ncount_4_units = 9\ncount_8_units = 9\n\nSo, total for units place in three-digit numbers:\n\ncount_4_units = 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\ncount_8_units = 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\n\nWait, so in the units place, 4 and 8 each appear 39 times in three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought for 400-488, 4 appears 9 times in units place, so adding up to 39, same for 8.\n\nSo, now, let me summarize the three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4 appears 89 times\n  - 8 appears 0 times\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4 appears 40 times\n  - 8 appears 39 times\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4 appears 39 times\n  - 8 appears 39 times\n\nSo, total in three-digit numbers:\n\ncount_4 = 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168\ncount_8 = 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, so in three-digit numbers, 4 appears 168 times, and 8 appears 78 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the counts from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4: 168\n- 8: 78\n\nTotal:\ncount_4 = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\ncount_8 = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, so total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, single-digit: 1 each. Correct.\n\nTwo-digit: 19 each. Correct, because tens place 10, units place 9, totaling 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\nTens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nUnits place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, 4's in three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n8's in three-digit: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nTotal:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit counts, because that's where most of the numbers come from.\n\nStarting with hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times 4, 10 times 8\n- 200-299: same\n- 300-399: same\n- 400-488: 10 times 4, 9 times 8\n\nSo, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 for 4's\n10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 for 8's\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 each\n- 200-299: 10 each\n- 300-399: 10 each\n- 400-488: 9 each\n\nSo, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 for 4's\n10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 for 8's\n\nSo, yes, that adds up correctly.\n\nSo, total 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188\n8's: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 488 is the last page, so in the three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488, is that correct?\n\nWait, 488 is included, so when I count up to 488, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place in 400-488, I thought 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times, but earlier I thought 488 is included, so 8 appears 9 times. Wait, but 488 is the last number, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: How many three-digit numbers are there? 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 numbers.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe I should think of it another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nLet me try that approach to cross-verify.\n\nIn any number from 1 to 488, each digit (units, tens, hundreds) can be considered separately.\n\nLet's consider each digit place:\n\n1. Units place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the units place from 1 to 488?\n\nWell, in every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each complete block, 4 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), 484 is present, so that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place: In each block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 48 complete blocks give 48 times. In the last partial block, 488 is included, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 appears 39 times in the units place in three-digit numbers, but now I'm getting 49 times in total. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps my earlier approach was wrong. Let me think.\n\nWait, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times, plus one if the last number is >= 484. Since 488 >= 484, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears 48 times in units place, plus 1 if 488 >= 488, which it is, so 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but in my earlier three-digit analysis, I had 39 times for 4's in the units place. But according to this, it's 49 times. So, clearly, I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's see where I went wrong. Earlier, I broke down the units place into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, but maybe that's where I messed up.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider all numbers from 1 to 488, and count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nAs above, 49 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often in each position, except possibly the last partial block.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 400-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 4 * 10 = 40 times each digit in the tens place.\n\nNow, in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, since 488 is the last number. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each digit appear?\n\nFrom 400-488, there are 89 numbers. The tens digits cycle from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which appears 9 times.\n\nWait, 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 numbers\n410-419: tens digit 1, 10 numbers\n...\n480-488: tens digit 8, 9 numbers\n\nSo, in 400-488, each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place in 400-488:\n- 4 appears 10 times\n- 8 appears 9 times\n\nSo, total in tens place from 1-488:\n- 4: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50\n- 8: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49\n\nWait, but wait, in the complete hundreds (1-399), each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal for 8 in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nSimilarly, hundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: no hundreds digit, so 0 times.\n100-199: hundreds digit 1, 100 times\n200-299: hundreds digit 2, 100 times\n300-399: hundreds digit 3, 100 times\n400-488: hundreds digit 4, 89 times\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total in hundreds place:\n- 4: 89\n- 8: 0\n\nNow, adding up all digit places:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4: 49\n- 8: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4: 50\n- 8: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4: 89\n- 8: 0\n\nTotal for 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal for 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so this method gives the same result as before: 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut earlier, when I broke down three-digit numbers, I had a different count for units place, but now using this digit-by-digit approach, it's 49 times for 4 and 8 in units place, which seems correct.\n\nSo, perhaps my earlier mistake was in the three-digit breakdown where I didn't account for single and two-digit numbers correctly in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check: when I broke down three-digit numbers earlier, I considered units place in 100-199, etc., but maybe I should have included all numbers, not just three-digit.\n\nWait, no, the digit-by-digit approach is more accurate because it considers all numbers from 1 to 488, regardless of being one, two, or three-digit.\n\nSo, using the digit-by-digit approach, I get 4's total: 188, 8's total: 98, difference 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm the units place count again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 times, plus in the last partial ten (481-488), 484 is present, so one more, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears 49 times in the units place.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each.\n\nTens place: For 4, 50 times; for 8, 49 times.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think my initial approach was correct, but I might have confused myself when breaking down three-digit numbers. The digit-by-digit approach seems more straightforward and confirms the result.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - 4 appears 50 times.\n   - 8 appears 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - 4 appears 89 times (from 400 to 488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- **4's**: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's**: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference**: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm going to think out loud here, so I'll just jot down my thoughts as they come.\n\nFirst, I know that each page number is printed once, starting from 1 and ending at 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the positions of the digits. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. So, I should probably break this down into units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers, right? So, for every 10 numbers, each digit appears once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once.\n\nNow, considering the entire book has 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nSo, for the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times (once in each set of 10) plus one more time in the extra 8 numbers (which is 484). So, total 49 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 48 times in the units place, plus one more time in 488. So, that's 49 times as well.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 1 to 480, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, yes, units place gives 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) and then 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nNow, how many hundreds do we have in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, from 1 to 400, there are 4 sets of 100. Each set contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 times each digit appears in the tens place up to 400.\n\nThen, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, let's see how many times each digit appears in the tens place from 401 to 488.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the full 488 pages and calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nSo, the number of times a digit appears in the tens place can be calculated by looking at how many full hundreds we have and then the remaining part.\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, we have 4 full hundreds (1-400), and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- For each hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, each digit appears 4\u00d710=40 times.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), up to 8 (481-488). So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place here?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits are:\n\n- 0: 10 numbers (401-410)\n- 1: 10 numbers (411-420)\n- 2: 10 numbers (421-430)\n- 3: 10 numbers (431-440)\n- 4: 10 numbers (441-450)\n- 5: 10 numbers (451-460)\n- 6: 10 numbers (461-470)\n- 7: 10 numbers (471-480)\n- 8: 9 numbers (481-488)\n\nWait, because 481-488 is only 8 numbers, right? So, 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, not 9.\n\nWait, but let me check: 481-490 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, 481 is in the 80s for the tens place, so from 480-489, the tens digit is 8. But since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, but 480 is included in the previous hundred? Wait, no, 401-488 is from 401 to 488, so 480 is included in that range. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place from 401-488.\n\nWait, but 480 is part of 401-488, so yes, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488.\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488:\n\n- 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- 1: 10 times (411-420)\n- 2: 10 times (421-430)\n- 3: 10 times (431-440)\n- 4: 10 times (441-450)\n- 5: 10 times (451-460)\n- 6: 10 times (461-470)\n- 7: 10 times (471-480)\n- 8: 9 times (480-488)\n\nWait, but 480 is included in the 480-488 range, so that's 9 numbers, hence 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- The digit 4 appears 10 times in each of the 4 hundreds, so 4\u00d710=40 times, plus in 401-488, it appears 10 times in 441-450, so total 50 times.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, in the first 400 pages, each digit in the tens place appears 40 times. Then, in 401-488, the digit 4 in the tens place appears 10 times (441-450). So, total for the tens place, 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 in the tens place: in the first 400 pages, it's 4\u00d710=40 times. Then, in 401-488, it's 9 times in 480-488. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, in the first 400 pages, the tens digit 8 appears in 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. Each of those hundreds has a set where the tens digit is 8, which is 80-89 in each hundred. So, each hundred contributes 10 times the digit 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 180-189, another 10 times, and so on up to 300-399, which is 380-389, another 10 times. So, yes, 40 times up to 400.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times. So, total 49 times.\n\nWait, but 480 is included in 401-488, so yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for the tens place, digit 4 appears 50 times, and digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Wait, no, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nBut wait, the hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards. Pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so the hundreds digit is 0 for those, but we're not counting 0s here, so we can ignore that.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, digit 4 appears 89 times, and digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, digit 8 in the hundreds place is 0 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all those pages, so yes, 89 times. And digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book doesn't go beyond 488, so hundreds digit is only 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, digit 4 appears 89 times, and digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nStarting with digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nNow, digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nFirst, units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. That seems correct because each digit appears once every 10 numbers, and with 48 full tens and 8 extra, each digit appears 49 times.\n\nTens place: For 4, I had 50 times, and for 8, 49 times. Let me verify.\n\nIn the first 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), so total 50. 8 appears 9 times in 480-488, so 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. That's correct because 400-488 is 89 pages, and the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 (from first 400) + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 401-488 range again. The tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear?\n\n- 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- 1: 10 times (411-420)\n- 2: 10 times (421-430)\n- 3: 10 times (431-440)\n- 4: 10 times (441-450)\n- 5: 10 times (451-460)\n- 6: 10 times (461-470)\n- 7: 10 times (471-480)\n- 8: 9 times (480-488)\n\nWait, but 480 is part of the 480-488 range, so that's 9 numbers, as 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, yes, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 401-488.\n\nSo, the tens digit 8 appears 40 (from first 400) + 9 = 49 times. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 4 in the tens place, from 401-488, it's 10 times (441-450), so 40 + 10 = 50 times. That's correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the difference seems quite large. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of counting each digit in each place, maybe I can write a small program or use a formula to calculate the number of times each digit appears up to a certain number. But since I can't write a program here, maybe I can use a formula.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated using the following method:\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times d appears by breaking down N into higher, current, and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, I can use the method of considering each digit place separately, as I did before, but perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, let me recount the hundreds place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nIt's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nHow about the tens place? Let me think again.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 hundreds, so 4\u00d710=40 times.\n\nThen, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 times. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place:\n\nIn each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4\u00d710=40 times.\n\nIn the 401-488 range, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times. Correct.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor 4, in each ten numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 48 full tens (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8, in each ten numbers, 8 appears once. In the 481-488 range, 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think of a smaller example to test my approach.\n\nSuppose the book has 22 pages. Let's count how many 1's and 2's appear.\n\nPage numbers: 1-22.\n\nCount of 1's:\n\nUnits place: 1,11,21 \u2192 3 times.\n\nTens place: 10-19 \u2192 10 times.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 1's: 13.\n\nCount of 2's:\n\nUnits place: 2,12,22 \u2192 3 times.\n\nTens place: 20-22 \u2192 3 times.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 2's: 6.\n\nDifference: 13 - 6 = 7.\n\nLet me verify manually:\n\nPages: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22.\n\nCounting 1's:\n\nUnits: 1,11,21 \u2192 3.\n\nTens: 10-19 \u2192 10.\n\nTotal: 13.\n\nCounting 2's:\n\nUnits: 2,12,22 \u2192 3.\n\nTens: 20,21,22 \u2192 3.\n\nTotal: 6.\n\nDifference: 7. Correct.\n\nSo, using the same method as before, let's see:\n\nUnits place for 1: 2 full tens (1-20) \u2192 2 times, plus in 21-22, 21 has a 1 in units. So, 2 +1 =3.\n\nTens place for 1: 10-19 \u219210 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 1's: 13.\n\nUnits place for 2: 2 full tens (1-20) \u2192 2 times, plus 22 has a 2 in units. Wait, no, 22 is in 21-22, so units digit 2 appears once (22). So, total units: 2 (from 2 and 12) +1 (22) =3.\n\nTens place for 2: 20-22 \u21923 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 2's: 6.\n\nDifference:7. Correct.\n\nSo, the method works for the smaller case. Therefore, I think my approach is correct, and the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me recount the hundreds place for 488.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), so 10 times. So, 40 +10=50.\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nTens place: 49 times.\n\nUnits place:49 times.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nHmm, maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That might make it easier to count without missing any numbers. \n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete blocks of 10 in the total number of pages. Similarly for 8.\n\nBut wait, the total number of pages is 488, which isn't a multiple of 10. So, I'll need to calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then see if there are any extra numbers beyond that.\n\nLet me calculate how many complete tens are in 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and an additional 8 numbers. \n\nIn each complete block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, the last partial block goes from 481 to 488. Let me check how many 4's and 8's are in the units place in this partial block.\n\nLooking at 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial block, there's one 4 (at 484) and one 8 (at 488). So, adding to the units place counts, the total number of 4's in units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, 48 + 1 = 49. So, for units place, both digits appear 49 times. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, and the partial block contributes one 4 and one 8. So, yes, that makes 49 each. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 0-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut again, since we're only going up to 488, which is less than 500, we need to see how many complete hundreds there are and if there's a partial hundred.\n\n488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488, which is 88 numbers.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each complete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nSince there are 4 complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place from complete hundreds is 4 * 10 = 40, and similarly, 8's are also 40.\n\nNow, let's check the partial hundred from 401 to 488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, we need to see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for the numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here.\n\nWait, but actually, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit being 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For the tens digit being 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 9 times.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial hundred) = 50.\n\nThe total number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from partial hundred) = 49.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the partial hundred. From 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, but does 480-488 include 9 numbers? Let me count: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so yes, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens place, 4's total is 50, and 8's total is 49.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it's only non-zero from 100 onwards. So, for the hundreds digit, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place for 100 numbers each.\n\nWait, but in our case, the book has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes from 0 (for pages 1-99) to 4 (for pages 400-488). So, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nBut wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, yes, 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89, and 8's is 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 to each digit, so 48 each.\n- The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488), so total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both digits.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 10 each, so 40 each.\n- The partial hundred (401-488) has 10 for 4 (440-449) and 9 for 8 (480-488).\n- So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's tens, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's tens.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for the partial hundred? From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit being 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For the tens digit being 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So yes, 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 numbers, so 9 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nSimilarly, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place.\n\nSo, yes, the counts seem correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to think about how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor the units place:\nNumber of 4's = (488 // 10) + (1 if 4 <= (488 % 10) else 0)\nSimilarly for 8's.\n\nWait, let me test this formula.\n\nFor units digit:\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place from 1 to n is:\n(n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0), but only if d != 0, because 0 appears differently.\n\nWait, but in our case, d is 4 and 8, so non-zero.\n\nSo, for 4 in units place:\n488 // 10 = 48, and 488 % 10 = 8. Since 8 >= 4, we add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8 in units place:\n488 // 10 = 48, 488 %10 =8 >=8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFor tens place:\nNumber of times digit d appears in tens place from 1 to n is:\n(n // 100) * 10 + (min(max(n % 100 - 10*d + 1, 0), 10) if (n // 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to consider how many complete groups of 100 there are, each contributing 10 times the digit in the tens place, and then see how many in the partial group.\n\nFor digit d in tens place:\nComplete hundreds: 488 // 100 = 4, each contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nPartial hundred: 488 % 100 = 88.\n\nFor the tens digit, the number of times d appears is:\nIf the tens digit is less than d, then it's (d *10) numbers.\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate how many times d appears in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nFor the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nFor d=4: The tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFor d=8: The tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n4's: 40 +10=50\n8's:40 +9=49\n\nSame as before.\n\nFor hundreds place:\nNumber of times digit d appears in hundreds place from 1 to n is:\nIf d < the hundreds digit of n, then 100 times.\nIf d == the hundreds digit, then n - 100*d +1.\n\nWait, let's see. For n=488, the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, for d=4: It appears from 400 to 488, which is 488 - 400 +1 = 89 times.\n\nFor d=8: Since 8 >4, it doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0 times.\n\nSo, yes, 89 times for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up all the digits:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 to both digits: 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one 4 (at 484) and one 8 (at 488).\n   - **Total Units Place:** 49 for both 4's and 8's.\n\n2. **Count 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds, contributing 40 each for 4's and 8's.\n   - In the partial block (401-488):\n     - 4's appear 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8's appear 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total Tens Place:** 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's.\n\n3. **Count 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's appear 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8's do not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total Hundreds Place:** 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\n4. **Sum All Occurrences:**\n   - **4's Total:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **8's Total:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8 and find the difference between the two counts. That should give me how many more 4's there are than 8's. Hmm, okay, let's start by considering the digits in each place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me think about how digits are distributed in page numbers. Each page number can be a 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), 3-digit (100-488). I should consider each of these ranges separately to count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, for the 1-digit page numbers (1-9), the digit 4 appears once, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, for the 2-digit page numbers (10-99), I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place and how many times it appears in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place: For every ten numbers, like 10-19, 20-29, etc., the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 10 to 99, there are 9 sets of ten (10-19, ..., 90-99). Therefore, 4 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nIn the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for the entire 40-49 range, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, for 2-digit numbers, 4 appears 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19 times.\n\nNow, for the 3-digit page numbers (100-488), I need to count 4's in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, actually, each page number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences.\n\nNow, for the tens place in 3-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nLet's think about each hundred block separately. So, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn each hundred block, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every ten numbers. So, in each hundred block, the digit 4 appears in the tens place exactly 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). \n\nSo, for 100-199: 10 times\n200-299: 10 times\n300-399: 10 times\n400-488: Now, here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but we're stopping at 488, so the tens digit in 400-488 goes up to 8. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, right? So, that's 10 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 400-488 includes 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, that's 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's in 3-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488: the tens digit can go up to 8, so 440-449 is within that range, so yes, 10 times.\n\nNow, units place in 3-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nAgain, let's consider each hundred block.\n\nIn 100-199: For each ten numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once in each ten, so 10 times in total.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 10 times\n300-399: 10 times\n400-488: Now, in 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nFrom 400 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each ten, 4 appears once. How many tens are there? From 400 to 488, that's 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489, but wait, 488 is the last page, so up to 488. So, 400-409 is 10 numbers, 410-419 is another 10, up to 480-489, but 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 400-488 is the same as the number of times 4 appears in the units place in 0-88, because 400 + x where x is from 0 to 88. So, in x from 0 to 88, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, so 8 full tens (0-70) would have 8 occurrences, and then 80-88 would have one more at 84. Wait, that's 9 times. Wait, but 0-88 is 89 numbers, right? So, 0-88 includes 8 full decades (0-9, 10-19, ..., 70-79) and then 80-88. So, in each decade, 4 appears once in the units place, so 8 times, and then in 80-88, 84 is another occurrence. So, total 9 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the units place, 4 appears 9 times in 400-488.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, 400-409: 404\n410-419: 414\n420-429: 424\n430-439: 434\n440-449: 444\n450-459: 454\n460-469: 464\n470-479: 474\n480-488: 484\n\nSo, that's 9 times in the units place.\n\nTherefore, in 400-488, units digit 4 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's in 3-digit numbers:\n\n10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred block would have 10, but 400-488 only has 9. So, total units digit 4's in 3-digit numbers: 39.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 100-199, units digit 4 appears 10 times (104, 114, ..., 194). Similarly, 200-299: 204, 214, ..., 294: 10 times. 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394: 10 times. 400-488: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484: 9 times. So, yes, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in 3-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place: 89\nTens place: 40\nUnits place: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that up: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 4's in 3-digit numbers.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n1-digit: 1\n2-digit: 19\n3-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nAgain, I'll go through each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with 1-digit numbers (1-9): 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers (10-99):\n\nUnits place: For each ten, 8 appears once, so 9 sets (10-19, ..., 90-99), so 9 times.\n\nTens place: 8 appears in the entire 80-89 range, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSo, 2-digit numbers: 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19 8's.\n\nNow, 3-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in 3-digit numbers up to 488. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: Let's check each hundred block.\n\n100-199: The tens digit 8 appears in 180-189, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\n200-299: Similarly, 280-289: 10 times.\n\n300-399: 380-389: 10 times.\n\n400-488: Now, in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-488. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, that's only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place in 400-488? It's 9 times, because 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 in all of these, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's in 3-digit numbers:\n\n10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nUnits place in 3-digit numbers:\n\nAgain, each hundred block.\n\n100-199: For each ten, the units digit 8 appears once. So, 10 times.\n\n200-299: Similarly, 10 times.\n\n300-399: 10 times.\n\n400-488: Now, in 400-488, the units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times because 488 is included. So, from 400-488, units digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total units place 8's in 3-digit numbers:\n\n10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-488, the units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times, correct.\n\nSo, total 8's in 3-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 39\nUnits place: 39\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but wait, the hundreds place had 0, so total 8's in 3-digit numbers is 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n1-digit: 1\n2-digit: 19\n3-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. So, 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n1-digit: 1\n2-digit: 19\n3-digit: 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 168 = 188.\n\n8's:\n\n1-digit: 1\n2-digit: 19\n3-digit: 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the 3-digit counts. Let me verify the 3-digit counts again.\n\nFor 4's in 3-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTens place: 100-199: 10\n200-299: 10\n300-399: 10\n400-488: 10 (440-449)\nTotal: 40.\n\nUnits place: 100-199: 10\n200-299: 10\n300-399: 10\n400-488: 9\nTotal: 39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in 3-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 100-199: 10\n200-299: 10\n300-399: 10\n400-488: 9\nTotal: 39.\n\nUnits place: 100-199: 10\n200-299: 10\n300-399: 10\n400-488: 9\nTotal: 39.\n\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's: 98. Difference: 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 4's in the hundreds place are only up to 488, which is 89, but 8's in the hundreds place don't appear at all. So, that's a significant difference. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a formula for digit counting. The number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated using a method where you consider each digit place separately and calculate based on higher, current, and lower digits.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the units place in 400-488. Let me recount.\n\nIn 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place in 400-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSo, 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nAnd for 8's, in the hundreds place, none. In the tens place, 39, and units place, 39. So, 78.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the 8's in the units place again. From 400-488, units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times, correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I included all the 3-digit numbers correctly.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIn every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total groups of 10: 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, with 8 remaining numbers.\n\nSo, 48 * 1 = 48, plus in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), does 484 have a 4 in the units place? 484 is within 481-488, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing something.\n\nWait, no, in the 3-digit numbers, I had 39 units place 4's. But this method is giving me 49. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the previous method. Let me think again.\n\nWait, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many such numbers?\n\nThe first occurrence is 4, then every 10 after that. The last occurrence is 484.\n\nSo, the sequence is 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nThe number of terms in this sequence can be calculated as ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but in my previous count, I had 39. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I see. I was only counting from 100-488, but the units place 4's also include 4,14,24,...,94, which are in the 1-digit and 2-digit numbers.\n\nSo, in 1-digit and 2-digit numbers, units place 4's: from 1-99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIn 1-99, for every ten, 4 appears once in the units place, so 10 times (4,14,24,...,94). So, 10 times.\n\nThen, in 100-488, units place 4's: from 100-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's the same as from 0-388, because 100 + x where x is 0-388. So, in x from 0-388, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? That's 39 times (since 388 / 10 = 38 full groups, plus 8 remaining, so 38 + 1 = 39). Wait, but 388 is 38*10 + 8, so the last group is 380-388, which includes 384, so that's one more. So, 39 times.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 10 (1-99) + 39 (100-488) = 49, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, I think I made a mistake in my initial approach by not considering the 1-99 range for units place 4's. Instead, I separated it into 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit, which might have caused confusion.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, from 1-99, it's 10 times (8,18,28,...,98). Then, from 100-488, it's 39 times (as calculated earlier). So, total units place 8's: 10 + 39 = 49.\n\nWait, but in my initial count, I had 39 units place 8's in 3-digit numbers, but that was only from 100-488. So, adding the 10 from 1-99, total units place 8's would be 49. But earlier, I thought it was 39. Hmm, I think I need to reconcile this.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the counts. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately, considering all numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488. How many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times.\n\nTens place: 4 appears in the tens digit in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n\nWait, but from 1 to 488, the tens digit 4 appears in:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, total tens place 4's: 5 sets of 10, which is 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the 3-digit numbers, I considered 100-199, 200-299, etc., each contributing 10 tens place 4's, plus 440-449, which is another 10. So, 4 sets of 10 (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10. So, total tens place 4's: 4 sets of 10, which is 40. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I list them as 40-49, 140-149, etc., that's 5 sets. Wait, but 40-49 is in the 1-99 range, so that's an additional 10. So, in total, tens place 4's: 50.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial count by not including 40-49 in the 1-99 range. So, let's recast the problem.\n\nLet me consider each digit place separately, across all numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 times.\n\nTens place: 40-49: 10\n140-149:10\n240-249:10\n340-349:10\n440-449:10\nTotal: 50 times.\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,...,484: 49 times, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, total 4's: 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. That's consistent with my initial count.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nHundreds place: 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10\n180-189:10\n280-289:10\n380-389:10\n480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers)\nTotal tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488: Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, plus 8 remaining numbers (481-488). In each group, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the remaining 8 numbers, 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 49 (tens) + 49 (units) = 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with my initial count. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think this is correct. I've cross-verified using different methods, and they all point to the same answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Hundreds Place:** 400-488 (89 times).\n2. **Tens Place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 (50 times).\n3. **Units Place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 (49 times).\n\nTotal 4's: 89 + 50 + 49 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Hundreds Place:** 0 times (since the book ends at 488).\n2. **Tens Place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 (49 times).\n3. **Units Place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 (49 times).\n\nTotal 8's: 0 + 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm going to think out loud here, so I might start with some initial thoughts and then refine my approach as I go along.\n\nFirst, I know that each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and each number is printed once. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I can analyze each position one by one.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit (like 4 or 8) appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nWait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, that means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. In each full cycle, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 cycles, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, so far, the count for units place is equal for both digits.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digits go from 1 to 8, right? So, in the last partial set, 4 is present once (484) and 8 is present once (488). So, yes, units place counts for 4 and 8 are both 49. So, the difference so far is zero.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, with each digit from 0 to 9 appearing 10 times in each cycle. So, for each digit in the tens place, it appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each digit, including 4 and 8, each appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see: from 401 to 409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, tens digit is 1; ... up to 480-488, tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Let's see: The tens digit is 4 when the page numbers are 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 when the page numbers are 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4 appears 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the tens place, 4 is appearing once more than 8. But let me make sure I did that correctly.\n\nWait, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449) and 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). So, yes, 10 and 9 respectively. So, adding to the full hundreds: 4*10=40, so 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+9=49 for 8. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is the hundreds digit 4, right? Because 400 is 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is also 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds digit for 400-488 is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nBut wait, 8's in the hundreds place: 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, that seems significant. So, putting it all together:\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times. Difference: 0.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. Difference: +1.\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. Difference: +89.\n\nSo, total difference would be 0 + 1 + 89 = 90. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nEach 10 pages, each digit 0-9 appears once in units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, with 8 remaining pages (481-488).\n\nIn each full cycle, 4 and 8 each appear once in units place. So, 48 * 1 = 48 each.\n\nIn the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. So, correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach 100 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 488 pages mean 4 full hundreds (1-400), and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 each.\n\nIn the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-409: tens digit 0\n- 410-419: tens digit 1\n- 420-429: tens digit 2\n- 430-439: tens digit 3\n- 440-449: tens digit 4 (10 times)\n- 450-459: tens digit 5\n- 460-469: tens digit 6\n- 470-479: tens digit 7\n- 480-488: tens digit 8 (9 times, since 488 is included)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, adding to the 40 from the full hundreds, 4 has 50, 8 has 49. So, correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so 4 and 8 do not appear here.\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n- 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n- 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems right. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nCalculating number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: As before, 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last 8 pages, 4 appears once (484). So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. In the last 88 pages, 440-449 is 10 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last 8 pages, 488 is the only one, so 1. So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. In the last 88 pages, 480-488 is 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's and '8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total full cycles of 10 in 488 pages: 48 cycles.\n   - '4' and '8' each appear 48 times in the units place from these cycles.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488): '4' appears once (484), '8' appears once (488).\n   - **Total:** '4' = 48 + 1 = 49, '8' = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Counting '4's and '8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Full hundreds: 4 sets (1-400), contributing 40 each.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - '4' in tens place: 440-449 (10 times).\n     - '8' in tens place: 480-488 (9 times).\n   - **Total:** '4' = 40 + 10 = 50, '8' = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Counting '4's and '8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, '4' appears 89 times.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total:** '4' = 89, '8' = 0.\n\n4. **Calculating Total Counts:**\n   - **'4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **'8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. Since it's a 488-page book, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the hundreds place can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, but since we start at page 1, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's in each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers. In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-99, there's one block (40-49). From 100-199, another block (140-149), and so on up to 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 might not complete a full block. Let me think.\n\nFrom 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFrom 100-199: 140-149, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: 240-249, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: 340-349, another 10 times.\n\nNow, from 400-488: The tens digit here would be 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 times.\n\nSo, adding these up: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), so the tens digit in 440-449 is indeed 10, which is within that range. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks and 8 extra numbers. Each block contributes 1, so 48 times. In the last partial block (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: In every block of 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's count these.\n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, adding up: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, adding up 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again for 8's. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial decade is 481-488, which includes 488, so one more 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place, 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48, and then 484 in the last partial decade, so 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: From 1-99, 40-49: 10 times. 100-199: 140-149: 10. 200-299: 240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10. So, 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: 1-99:80-89:10. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, 49. Correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book is 488 pages, the hundreds digit can't be 8, so zero. That's correct.\n\nHmm, I think that's right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm going to take it slow because I don't want to miss anything.\n\nFirst, I know that each page number is printed once, from page 1 to page 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the digits in the units place and then move on to the tens place. Maybe I should handle each digit position separately to avoid confusion.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in pages 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Similarly, in pages 11-20, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 again, and so on.\n\nIn each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, right? So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra pages (481-488).\n\nSo, in each of these 48 sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. That gives 48 fours so far. Now, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear here? Yes, on page 484. So that's one more 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 pages, which are 481-488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once here, on 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: Each set of ten has one 8 in the units place, so 48 sets give 48 eights. In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once on page 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\nWait, but that would mean the number of 4's and 8's in the units place is the same, both 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here because I thought there might be a difference.\n\nWait, let me double-check. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 each. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's: 48 +1=49, and 8's: 48 +1=49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nOkay, so now let's move on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each set of 100 pages will have 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but actually, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, right? So, maybe it's better to think of it as 100 pages having 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, except for the first 9 pages where the tens digit is 0. Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that for every hundred pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place, except that 0 appears only 9 times because pages 1-9 don't have a tens digit. Wait, no, actually, pages 1-9 have a tens digit of 0, so 0 appears 9 times in the tens place from 1-99. Then, from 100-199, the tens digit cycles again, so 0 appears 10 times in 100-109, 1 appears 10 times in 110-119, etc., up to 9 appearing 10 times in 190-199.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe number of times a digit appears in the tens place can be calculated by considering how many full hundreds there are and then the remaining pages.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the tens place: Each time the tens digit is 4, it's for a block of 10 pages. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each such block contributes 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, etc., each contributing 10 eights.\n\nSo, let's figure out how many such blocks exist up to page 488.\n\nFirst, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the tens place:\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears once in the block 40-49, contributing 10 fours. So, in 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours.\n\nNow, in the remaining pages 401-488, we need to check if there's another block where the tens digit is 4. The next block after 400 would be 440-449. But 488 is less than 440? Wait, no, 401-488 includes pages up to 488, so 440-449 is within this range. So, that's another block of 10 pages where the tens digit is 4, contributing another 10 fours.\n\nSo, total fours in the tens place: 4*10 +10=50.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 fours, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. Wait, but up to 488, the last block is 440-449, which is within 401-488. So, that's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there were 4 hundreds, each contributing one block, but actually, each hundred contributes one block, and then in the 401-488 range, which is part of the fifth hundred (401-500), but we only go up to 488, so the block 440-449 is included, giving another 10 fours. So, total 5 blocks, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: Each hundred contributes a block where the tens digit is 8, i.e., 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but 480-489 is within 401-488? Wait, 480-489 is pages 480-489, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this block. So, that's 9 pages, right? Because 480-488 is 9 pages, not 10. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. Wait, no, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 pages, because 488 - 480 +1 =9.\n\nWait, but in terms of the tens digit, 480-489 would have the tens digit as 8, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears in pages 480-488, which is 9 pages, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each block where the tens digit is 8 is 10 pages, like 80-89, which is 10 pages. So, in each hundred, there's one such block. So, up to page 488, how many such blocks are there?\n\nIn 1-100: 80-89: 10 eights.\n\n101-200: 180-189: 10 eights.\n\n201-300: 280-289: 10 eights.\n\n301-400: 380-389: 10 eights.\n\n401-488: 480-488: 9 eights, because 480-488 is 9 pages, not 10.\n\nSo, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) plus 9 from 480-488.\n\nSo, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would give 40, plus the 9 from 480-488, making 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total eights in the tens place: 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought for fours in the tens place, we had 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours. So, 50 fours in the tens place and 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, let me add up the fours and eights from both units and tens places.\n\nFor fours:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 50.\n\nTotal fours: 49 +50=99.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:49.\n\nTotal eights:49 +49=98.\n\nSo, the number of fours is 99, and the number of eights is 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 99 -98=1.\n\nWait, but that seems too small. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor fours: 48 sets of ten (1-480), each contributing one 4 in the units place: 48.\n\nPlus the extra 8 pages (481-488): 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, 48 +1=49 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for eights: 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 8 in the units place:48.\n\nPlus the extra 8 pages: 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 +1=49 eights.\n\nSo, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\nFours: Each hundred contributes one block of 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 fours: 4*10=40.\n\nPlus, in 401-488, the block 440-449 is included, which is another 10 fours. So, total 5*10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\nEights: Each hundred contributes one block of 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights:4*10=40.\n\nIn 401-488, the block 480-489 would contribute 10 eights, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nThus, total eights in the tens place:40 +9=49.\n\nSo, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens)=99.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:99 -98=1.\n\nHmm, so the number of fours printed is 1 more than the number of eights.\n\nWait, but I feel like I might have missed something. Let me check the tens place again.\n\nWait, when I calculated the fours in the tens place, I considered 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 pages, so 5 blocks *10=50 fours. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights in the tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four blocks are 10 pages each, contributing 4*10=40 eights. The last block, 480-488, is 9 pages, contributing 9 eights, so total 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens)=99.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:1.\n\nWait, so the answer is 1 more four than eight.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when dealing with page numbers, especially in the hundreds, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the total number of fours and eights separately, considering each digit place.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of fours: As before, 49.\n\nNumber of eights:49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of fours:50.\n\nNumber of eights:49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nWait, I didn't consider the hundreds place yet. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier. I only considered units and tens places, but in a 488-page book, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3, or 4.\n\nSo, I need to check if the hundreds digit contributes any fours or eights.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digits go from 0 (for pages 1-99) to 4 (for pages 400-488). So, for pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which doesn't contribute any fours or eights.\n\nFor pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no fours or eights.\n\n200-299: hundreds digit is 2, no fours or eights.\n\n300-399: hundreds digit is 3, no fours or eights.\n\n400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so every page from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, how many pages are there from 400-488? 488 -400 +1=89 pages.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 in the hundreds place: Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes zero eights.\n\nTherefore, total fours: Units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89)=49+50=99; 99+89=188 fours.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 99 fours, but now adding the hundreds place, it's 188 fours. Wait, that's a big difference. So, I think I missed the hundreds place earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for eights: Units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98 eights.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours -98 eights=90 more fours.\n\nWait, that's a different answer. So, I think I missed the hundreds place earlier, which significantly changes the result.\n\nSo, let me correct my approach.\n\nI think I initially forgot to consider the hundreds place. So, let's redo the calculation including the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total digits to consider: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with fours:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours:49 +50 +89=188.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:49.\n\nHundreds place:0, since the book doesn't go beyond 488, so no pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal eights:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, difference:188 -98=90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because the hundreds digit contributes a lot more fours.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the hundreds place calculation.\n\nFrom 400-488, how many pages? 488 -400 +1=89 pages. Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 89 fours.\n\nUnits place:49 fours.\n\nTens place:50 fours.\n\nTotal:89+49+50=188 fours.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal:98 eights.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 1, but that was without considering the hundreds place. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial approach by ignoring the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any other mistakes.\n\nLet me recount the fours in the tens place. Each hundred contributes a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages each. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the block 440-449 is included, which is another 10 fours. So, 40+10=50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the eights in the tens place: Each hundred contributes a block where the tens digit is 8, which is 10 pages each. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389), each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the block 480-488 is included, which is 9 pages, contributing 9 eights. So, 40+9=49 eights in the tens place. Correct.\n\nUnits place: For fours, 48 sets of ten (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Plus the extra 8 pages (481-488), where 484 has a 4, so 49 fours. For eights, similarly, 48 sets of ten contributing 48 eights, plus 488, so 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours from 400-488, and 0 eights.\n\nSo, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct now.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each set of ten pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one '4' in the units place. There are 48 full sets in 480 pages, contributing 48 '4's. Pages 481-488 add one more '4' (page 484). Total: 49 '4's.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, each set of ten contributes one '8'. Pages 1-480 give 48 '8's. Page 488 adds another '8'. Total: 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred contains a block of ten pages with '4' in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). Up to 400, there are four such blocks, contributing 40 '4's. Pages 401-488 include another block (440-449), adding 10 '4's. Total: 50 '4's.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, each hundred has a block of ten pages with '8' in the tens place. Up to 400, four blocks contribute 40 '8's. Pages 401-488 include pages 480-488, adding 9 '8's. Total: 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place, totaling 89 pages. Thus, 89 '4's.\n   - **8's:** No page has '8' in the hundreds place. Total: 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's. The final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I should check each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, and maybe thousands, but since the book only has 488 pages, the thousands place won't be used beyond 4, but actually, 488 is less than 1000, so maybe I don't need to consider the thousands place beyond the hundreds place. Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so the hundreds place can go up to 4, the tens place up to 8, and the units place up to 8.\n\nWait, no. Actually, 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the first page is 1, the hundreds digit starts from 0 (for pages 1-99) up to 4 (for pages 400-488). Hmm, maybe I should approach this by looking at each digit place separately.\n\nLet me try to count the number of 4's in each place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Now, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 pages left over. So in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, once in each group of 10. But wait, in the last 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Each group of 10 pages contributes exactly one 4 in the units place. So for 488 pages, there are 48 full groups of 10, which would give 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each group of 100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 for each ten pages. So for each 100 pages, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for exactly 10 pages (e.g., 40-49). So how many complete groups of 100 are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete groups of 100. Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 fours.\n\nBut wait, we also have the last partial group of 88 pages (from 401 to 488). In this partial group, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So the tens digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. So that's another 10 fours in the tens place. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 488 is only up to page 488, so from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 pages. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, right? So how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So yes, 400 to 488 is 89 pages, so 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So that's correct.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So there are 188 fours printed.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. So I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, for every group of 10, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears once every 10 pages. So in 488 pages, how many groups of 10 are there? 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 appears in 488, so yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the tens place. For the tens digit, in each group of 100 pages, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So for each 100 pages, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (e.g., 80-89). So how many complete groups of 100 are there in 488 pages? 4 complete groups, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So the tens digit 8 appears in the tens place for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages: 480, 481, ..., 488. So that's 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages, so 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place 8's are 40 (from the complete groups) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check: in the last partial group, the tens digit 8 appears from 480 to 488, which is 9 pages. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So the hundreds place contributes zero eights.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188 and total 8's are 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be too high. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately and see if I get the same result.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor 4's: Every 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times, plus one more in the last 8 pages (484), so 49. Correct.\n\nFor 8's: Similarly, every 10 pages, 8 appears once in the units place. So 48 times, plus one more in 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: Each 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 times, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10. Total 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's: Each 100 pages, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. 4 times, so 40. Then, in the last 88 pages, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9. Total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nFor 8's: No pages have 8 in the hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, correct. So 89 fours.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, I had 50, which is 40 from the complete hundreds and 10 from the last partial hundred. Correct.\n\nIn the units place, 49 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units and tens places both have 49 each, so 98.\n\nSo the difference is indeed 90. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit separately, as I did, and confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula for digit counting.\n\nThe formula for counting the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated by looking at each digit place separately.\n\nBut since I'm doing it manually, perhaps I can try another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can calculate how many 4's and 8's are there in each position.\n\nWait, another way: for each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if the remainder is >=4, add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488 /10)=48, plus if remainder >=8, add 1. 488 mod10=8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 100) =4, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, the remainder is 488 - 4*100=88. Now, in the tens place, how many 4's in the remaining 88 pages? The tens digit cycles every 100, so in 88 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (40-49). So 10 fours. So total tens place 4's:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in tens place: floor(488 /100)=4, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Remainder is 88, so in the tens place, how many 8's? The tens digit goes up to 8, so from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights. So total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 1000)=0, but since 488 >=400, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So 89 fours.\n\nNumber of 8's: hundreds digit 8 would be from 800-899, but since 488 <800, no eights in the hundreds place. So 0.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's printed is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step. I think I should start by considering how numbers are structured in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So from page 1 to page 488, the pages go from 1, 2, ..., up to 488. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nFirst, maybe I should count the number of 4's and 8's separately. Let me think about each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll need to check each place for both digits, 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, how often does 4 appear? Well, in every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each set of ten, 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, 8 appears once every ten numbers. So, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, right? But wait, maybe not exactly because the total number of pages is 488, which isn't a multiple of ten. So I might need to adjust for that.\n\nLet me calculate the number of times 4 appears in the units place. From page 1 to 488, how many complete groups of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of ten, and then 8 extra pages. In each group of ten, the units digit 4 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: in each group of ten, 8 appears once, so 48 times, and in the extra 8 pages, 8 appears once (page 488). So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, no difference there.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101 to 200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on.\n\nLet me figure out how many hundreds are in 488. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears exactly 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. So that's another 10 times.\n\nSo total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place. Let's see, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears from 80-89, which is 10 times. So in each hundred, 10 times. There are 4 hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nIn the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so pages 480-488. That's 9 pages, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times. So, 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. So, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning 89 times.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this book because the book is 488 pages. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, that's 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me add up the counts from each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1 '4' and 1 '8'.\n- 48 * 1 = 48 for each digit.\n- Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, '4' appears once (484), and '8' appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for each, correct.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4's:\n  - Each hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 '4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n  - 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40.\n  - Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more.\n  - Total 50, correct.\n- For 8's:\n  - Each hundred has 10 '8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n  - 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40.\n  - In 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488), so 9 more.\n  - Total 49, correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n- 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place, correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should consider all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think I should break this down by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That might make it easier to count without missing any numbers.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.).\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's is equal to the number of 8's. But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking how many more 4's there are than 8's. Maybe I'm missing something in the higher digit places.\n\nLet me check the tens place next. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is also 10 times. So again, in the tens place, the count is equal for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 since the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can only be up to 4 because 488 is less than 500. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all in this book. That means the count for 8 in the hundreds place is zero.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- For the units place, both 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. Let's calculate how many times that is.\n\nFrom page 1 to 488, there are 488 pages. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place. So, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think the correct way is to consider that each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 full times, and then the remaining 8 pages (since 488 = 48*10 + 8) will have the digits 1 through 8 appearing one more time each in the units place.\n\nWait, that might complicate things. Maybe a better approach is to calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages.\n\nIn each complete group of 10, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for 48 complete groups, each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nNow, for the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, digits 1 through 8 each appear once more in the units place, and digits 9 and 0 don't appear in these last 8 pages.\n\nSo, the total number of times each digit appears in the units place:\n\n- Digits 1-8: 48 + 1 = 49 times\n- Digits 9,0: 48 times\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the units digits from 1 to 8 each appear 49 times, and 9 and 0 appear 48 times. So, for the digit 4, it appears 49 times in the units place, and similarly, the digit 8 appears 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the units place, from 1 to 488, the digit 4 appears in every 10th number, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many times is that?\n\nLet me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens plus one if the last page is beyond the next multiple of 10.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the units place.\n\nTotal pages: 488\n\nNumber of complete tens: 48 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more pages (481-488).\n\nIn each complete ten, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 48 complete tens, each digit appears 48 times.\n\nIn the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so each of these digits appears once more. So, digits 1-8 each appear 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place, and digits 9 and 0 appear 48 times.\n\nTherefore, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 49 times, and the digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears in blocks of 100 pages. For example, in the tens place, digit 4 appears in the range 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, and similarly for other hundreds.\n\nWait, but since the book only goes up to 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nSo, let's calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFor each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 every 100 pages.\n\nIn each hundred block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n\nBut wait, the last hundred block is 400-488, which is only 88 pages, not 100. So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 48 tens and 8 units). So, in the 400-488 block, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (440-449). Wait, no, because 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 440-449 is 10 pages, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in this block.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 490, so the tens digit goes up to 8 (as in 480-488). So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit runs from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (440-449), so that's 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, in each of the previous hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place each.\n\nSo, how many hundred blocks are there?\n\nFrom 0-99: 1 block\n100-199: 2nd block\n200-299: 3rd block\n300-399: 4th block\n400-488: 5th block\n\nSo, 5 blocks in total.\n\nIn each of the first four blocks (0-399), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nIn the fifth block (400-488), it appears 10 times as well, as 440-449 is within 400-488.\n\nSo, total times digit 4 appears in the tens place: 5 blocks * 10 times = 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait, the fifth block is only up to 488, so does the tens digit go up to 8? So, in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so 440-449 is within that, so yes, 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place.\n\nDigit 8 appears in the tens place in each hundred block in the range 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nSo, in each hundred block, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many hundred blocks do we have?\n\nSame as before: 5 blocks.\n\nIn each of the first four blocks, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nIn the fifth block (400-488), the tens digits go up to 8, so 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the range is 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears from 480 to 488, which is 9 times, not 10 times.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So, in the fifth block (400-488), the digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times (480-488), not 10 times.\n\nSo, for the digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nFirst four blocks: 4 blocks * 10 = 40 times\nFifth block: 9 times\nTotal: 40 + 9 = 49 times\n\nWait, that's different from the digit 4, which had 50 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, digit 4 in tens place: 50 times\nDigit 8 in tens place: 49 times\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in the numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nDigit 8 in the hundreds place: Well, since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The hundreds digits go up to 4, so digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages (48*10). Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), digits 1-8 each appear once more, so digits 1-8 have 49 each, and 9 and 0 have 48 each. So, digit 4 and 8 both have 49 in units place. That's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For digit 4: 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n- For digit 8: First four blocks each contribute 10, so 4*10=40. Fifth block (400-488) has 9 times (480-488), so total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4: 89 times (400-488). Correct.\n- Digit 8: 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for digit 8. Let me check again.\n\nIn the fifth block (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, so the range where tens digit is 8 is 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the fifth block. So, 4 blocks with 10 each (40) plus 9, total 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 4 in the tens place, the fifth block includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, 5 blocks with 10 each, 50 times.\n\nSo, yes, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - In the last 8 pages (481-488), digits 1-8 each appear once more.\n   - Thus, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Digit 4 appears 10 times in each of the 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), totaling 50 times.\n   - Digit 8 appears 10 times in each of the first four blocks and 9 times in the fifth block (400-488), totaling 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all pages 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - Digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. So pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit numbers. Maybe I should break this down into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers separately and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each position.\n\nFirst, let's think about single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear exactly once, right? So for single-digit pages, the count of 4's is 1 and the count of 8's is also 1. So the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each position.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For the tens digit, 4 can appear from 40 to 49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 can appear from 80 to 89, which is also 10 times. So in the tens place, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times each.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So in each ten numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. Since there are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit numbers (from 10 to 99), that's 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but actually, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So for the units place, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo adding up the two places for two-digit numbers:\n- Tens place: 10 fours and 10 eights.\n- Units place: 9 fours and 9 eights.\nTotal for two-digit numbers:\n- Fours: 10 + 9 = 19\n- Eights: 10 + 9 = 19\nSo the difference for two-digit numbers is 19 - 19 = 0.\n\nHmm, so far, single-digit and two-digit pages have the same number of 4's and 8's. Now, let's consider the three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488.\n\nThree-digit numbers have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let's analyze each place separately.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n- 4 appears only in 400-488. So from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8.\n\nSo in the hundreds place, 4's count is 89 and 8's count is 0. So that's a difference of 89 right there.\n\nNow, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundred. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit affects the tens and units digits beyond 400.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to split the three-digit numbers into two parts: 100-399 and 400-488.\n\nFirst, 100-399: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 100 numbers. Let's consider the tens and units places for each.\n\nIn the tens place for 100-399:\n- For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. Since there are 3 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), that's 3*10 = 30 fours and 30 eights in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place for 100-399:\n- For each hundred, each units digit 0-9 appears 10 times. So 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times per hundred. So again, 3 hundreds give 3*10 = 30 fours and 30 eights in the units place.\n\nSo for 100-399:\n- Tens place: 30 fours, 30 eights.\n- Units place: 30 fours, 30 eights.\nTotal for 100-399:\n- Fours: 30 + 30 = 60\n- Eights: 30 + 30 = 60\nDifference here is 0.\n\nNow, let's consider 400-488. This is from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nLet's break this down into tens and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: As before, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, the tens place in 400-488:\n- The tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear?\n- From 400-409: tens digit is 0, then 410-419: tens digit 1, and so on up to 480-488: tens digit 8.\n- So for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many numbers are there?\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 numbers (e.g., 400-409 is 10 pages). But for tens digit 8, it's only 9 numbers (480-488).\n- So, for the tens digit:\n  - 0: 10\n  - 1: 10\n  - 2: 10\n  - 3: 10\n  - 4: 10\n  - 5: 10\n  - 6: 10\n  - 7: 10\n  - 8: 9\n- Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? When the tens digit is 4, which is from 440-449. That's 10 times.\n- How about 8? 8 appears only when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488. That's 9 times.\n\nSo in the tens place for 400-488:\n- 4 appears 10 times.\n- 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, the units place in 400-488:\n- The units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens group. But since the last group (480-488) only goes up to 8, the units digits there are 0-8.\n\nLet's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\nFor each tens group from 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479: Each has 10 numbers, so in each group, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once.\n\nThere are 8 such full tens groups (400-409 up to 470-479), so 4 appears 8 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nNow, the last group is 480-488, which has 9 numbers. The units digits here are 0-8. So 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo total units place counts:\n- 4: 8 (from full groups) + 1 (from last group) = 9\n- 8: 8 (from full groups) + 1 (from last group) = 9\n\nWait, but wait, let me check that again. For each full tens group, like 400-409, the units digits go from 0-9, so 4 appears once (404) and 8 appears once (408). Since there are 8 full tens groups (400-409 to 470-479), that's 8 times each for 4 and 8. Then, in 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is 4 and 488 is 8. So that adds one more 4 and one more 8. So total units place:\n- 4: 8 + 1 = 9\n- 8: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nSo in the units place for 400-488:\n- 4 appears 9 times\n- 8 appears 9 times\n\nWait, but let me confirm: For 400-409, units digits are 0-9, so 404 is one 4, and 408 is one 8. Similarly, 410-419: 414 and 418, etc., up to 470-479: 474 and 478. So that's 8 groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 8 each. Then, in 480-488, we have 484 (units digit 4) and 488 (units digit 8). So that's two more, making it 9 each. So yes, 9 each.\n\nSo in the units place for 400-488, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, putting it all together for 400-488:\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo total for 400-488:\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 108\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18\n\nWait, that seems off. Wait, 89 + 10 + 9 is 108? Wait, 89 + 10 is 99, plus 9 is 108. Hmm, but 400-488 is 89 pages, so the total number of digits should be 3*89 = 267 digits. Let me check if 108 + 18 = 126, but 267 is more than that, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, because I'm only counting the number of times 4 and 8 appear, not all digits. So maybe that's okay.\n\nWait, but let's see: For 400-488, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Then, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. In the units place, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So total 4's: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108. 8's: 0 + 9 + 9 = 18.\n\nSo the difference for 400-488 is 108 - 18 = 90.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\nDifference: 0\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\nDifference: 0\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4's: 60 (from 100-399) + 108 (from 400-488) = 168\n- 8's: 60 (from 100-399) + 18 (from 400-488) = 78\nWait, no, wait. Wait, earlier I considered 100-399 as 60 each for 4's and 8's, and 400-488 as 108 for 4's and 18 for 8's. So total three-digit 4's: 60 + 108 = 168. Three-digit 8's: 60 + 18 = 78.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because 100-399 is 300 pages, and 400-488 is 89 pages, so total three-digit pages are 389, which is correct because 488 - 100 + 1 = 389.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated 100-399 as 60 fours and 60 eights, and 400-488 as 108 fours and 18 eights. So total three-digit:\n- 4's: 60 + 108 = 168\n- 8's: 60 + 18 = 78\n\nSo total in the entire book:\n- 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188\n- 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98\n\nSo the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, 100-399: I thought 4's and 8's each appeared 60 times. But let me double-check that.\n\nFor 100-399, each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 100 numbers. For each hundred, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149, etc.), and 8 appears 10 times. Similarly, in the units place, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times, so 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times. So per hundred, 4's: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20. Similarly for 8's: 20 each. So for three hundreds, 3*20 = 60 for each digit. That seems correct.\n\nThen, for 400-488, we have 89 pages. In the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. In the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). In the units place, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times. So 4's: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108; 8's: 0 + 9 + 9 = 18. That seems correct.\n\nSo total 4's in three-digit: 60 + 108 = 168\nTotal 8's in three-digit: 60 + 18 = 78\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n- 4's: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188\n- 8's: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I thought maybe the difference was 90. But let me check if I made a mistake in the tens and units places for 400-488.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 400-488, I had 4 appearing 10 times (440-449) and 8 appearing 9 times (480-488). That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, for each full tens group (like 400-409), 4 appears once (404) and 8 appears once (408). There are 8 full tens groups before 480-488, so 8 times each, plus in 480-488, 484 and 488, which adds one more each. So total 9 each. That seems correct.\n\nSo the total 4's in 400-488: 89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 108\n8's: 0 (hundreds) + 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo the difference is 108 - 18 = 90 in 400-488, and overall, the total difference is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's total to 188 and 8's to 98, which is a difference of 90. So that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me think again: The problem is asking how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So if 4's are 188 and 8's are 98, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, in 100-399, 4's: 60, 8's: 60\nIn 400-488, 4's: 108, 8's: 18\nSo total 4's: 60 + 108 = 168\nTotal 8's: 60 + 18 = 78\n\nPlus single and two-digit:\n- Single: 1 each\n- Two-digit: 19 each\nSo total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a large number. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nUnits place:\n- For each page number, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So in 488 pages, how many complete cycles of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, with 8 remaining pages.\n\nIn each full cycle, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once. So for 48 full cycles:\n- 4's: 48\n- 8's: 48\n\nNow, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo total units place:\n- 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nTens place:\n- The tens digit cycles 0-9 every 100 pages. So in 488 pages, how many full hundreds? 4 full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499). But we only go up to 488, so the last hundred (400-488) is incomplete.\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSo for 4 full hundreds (100-399), that's 4*10 = 40 fours and 40 eights.\n\nNow, for the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digits go from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So for each tens digit from 0-8, how many times does each appear?\n\n- Tens digit 0: 400-409 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419 (10 pages)\n- ...\n- Tens digit 7: 470-479 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488 (9 pages)\n\nSo for tens digit 4: appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages.\nFor tens digit 8: appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSo in the tens place for 400-488:\n- 4 appears 10 times\n- 8 appears 9 times\n\nSo total tens place:\n- 4's: 40 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- The hundreds digit cycles 0-9 every 1000 pages, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n- Hundreds digits 1, 2, 3 each appear 100 times (100-199, etc.), but they don't affect the count of 4's and 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo in the hundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nNow, summing up all the places:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nOkay, so this method also gives a difference of 90. So I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the tens place for 400-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times, which matches this approach. So I think 90 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I can conclude that there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in all page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once.\n   - 8 appears once.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** Each digit appears 9 times (since there are 9 sets of 10 in 90 two-digit numbers).\n   - Total for two-digit:\n     - 4: 10 + 9 = 19\n     - 8: 10 + 9 = 19\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **100-399:**\n     - **Tens and Units places:** Each digit 4 and 8 appears 30 times each (3 hundreds \u00d7 10 each).\n   - **400-488:**\n     - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times.\n     - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n     - **Units place:** 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n     - Total for 400-488:\n       - 4: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108\n       - 8: 9 + 9 = 18\n   - Total for three-digit:\n     - 4: 60 (from 100-399) + 108 = 168\n     - 8: 60 (from 100-399) + 18 = 78\n   - Difference: 108 - 18 = 90.\n\n4. **Total counts:**\n   - **4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n   - **8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step. I think I should consider each digit place separately, like units, tens, and hundreds, and count how many times each digit appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 each appear once in the units place. So, from page 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus maybe one more if the last group has a 4 in the units place. Wait, the last group ends at 488, so the units digits go up to 8. So, the 48th group ends at 480, and then we have pages 481 to 488. So, in the units place, from 481 to 488, the digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so maybe the units place doesn't contribute any difference. Wait, but let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, because each group of 10 contributes exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place, right? So, 48 groups give 48 each, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in those, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, no difference in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. Then this repeats for each hundred.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, 10 times each. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the remaining 88 pages (401-488)? The tens digits here go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this last partial hundred.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, there are 10 pages except for the last one, which goes up to 88, so 9 pages. Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 pages, so 88 divided by 10 is 8.8, so 8 complete tens groups (each of 10 pages) and then 8 pages.\n\nWait, actually, from 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n...\n471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n481-488: tens digit 8 (8 pages)\n\nSo, in the tens place, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? Yes, because 440 is greater than 401 and less than 488. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times here.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 480-488 is 9 pages: 480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, 480 is the first page, and 488 is the last, so that's 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in this last partial hundred.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the last partial hundred, so 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTens place 8's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last partial hundred, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's there. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's. From 200-299, it's 2; same thing. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, when does 8 appear in the hundreds place? That would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, hundreds place 4's: 89\nHundreds place 8's: 0\nDifference: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place.\n\nUnits place: 4's - 8's = 49 - 49 = 0\nTens place: 50 - 49 = 1\nHundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference, 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me go through each place again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 48 (since 48*10=480)\nEach group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each.\nThen, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\nSo, units 4's: 48 +1=49\nUnits 8's: 48 +1=49\nDifference: 0\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10=40 each.\n\nIn the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place: 440-449 is within 401-488, so 10 pages, so 10 more 4's.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 more 8's.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 +9=49\nDifference: 50-49=1\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\n8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 0 8's.\n\nDifference: 89-0=89\n\nTotal difference: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =90\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, but inclusive, so 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, I had 50 4's and 49 8's, so a difference of 1.\n\nUnits place, no difference.\n\nSo, adding them up, 89 +1=90. So, 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 complete groups (480 pages) contribute 48 each.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total 4's: 49, 8's: 49. Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - Last 88 pages (401-488) contribute 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 50, 8's: 49. Difference: 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n   - No 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference: 89.\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Units: 0\n   - Tens: 1\n   - Hundreds: 89\n   - Total: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me break this down step by step. Maybe I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Hmm, let's start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, let's think about the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each block, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Plus, in the last partial block, from 481-488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 would have a 4 in the units place. So that's one more, making it 49 times in the units place for 4's.\n\nNow, for the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a whole block of 10 numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. The first block is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's five blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks would give 5*10=50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. \n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, 50 times. \n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. Let's see, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but our book only goes up to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers? It's 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 for each, so that's 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is indeed 4, but I should count how many numbers that is. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When considering the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. So, adding up all the places:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal number of 4's: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with the units place: similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more, making it 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 instances of 8 in the tens place, except maybe the last one, 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9 instances of 8 in the tens place. So total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, so yes, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal number of 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. For each block:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times\n- 180-189: 10 times\n- 280-289: 10 times\n- 380-389: 10 times\n- 480-488: 9 times\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was counting 4's in the hundreds place, I had 89 instances because 400-488 is 89 numbers. But for 8's, since 800 is beyond 488, there are none. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the units place for 4's. Let's see: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is in there, which is one more 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the last partial ten, 488 is included, so one more, making it 49. Correct.\n\nNow, tens place for 4's: let's see. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, up to 488, how many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers\nFrom 100-199: 140-149: 10\nFrom 200-299: 240-249: 10\nFrom 300-399: 340-349: 10\nFrom 400-488: 440-449: 10 (since 440-449 is within 488)\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So that's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:50, 8's in tens place:49.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 4's: numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor 8's in hundreds place: none, since 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when I think about it, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+49+0=98\n\n188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems right. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe using a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit is >=4, which it is (8 >=4), so 48 +1=49.\n\nFor 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit is >=8, which it is (8=8), so 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: floor(488/100)=4, but wait, that's not the way. Wait, the number of complete blocks of 100 is 4 (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399). Each contributes 10 times 4 in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial block, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nFor 8's: similarly, floor(488/100)=4, so 4 blocks, each contributing 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial block, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, total 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor 8's: hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I can't spot any mistakes in the reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every block of 10 numbers contributes one '4' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (480 numbers) and a partial block (481-488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's in the tens place.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Numbers 400-488 contribute '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to '4's, every block of 10 contributes one '8'.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No numbers in 1-488 have '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me break this down step by step. I think I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8, and then subtract the two counts to find the difference. \n\nFirst, let me consider the structure of page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit numbers. \n\nI think I should analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Because in each position, the digits cycle from 0 to 9, and I can count how often each digit appears in each position.\n\nLet's start by considering the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, for example, in 1-10, 4 appears once in the units place (page 4), and 8 appears once (page 8). Similarly, in 11-20, 4 appears at 14, and 8 at 18, and so on.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles 48 times (because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but we take the integer part, which is 48 full cycles, and then a partial cycle from 1 to 8). Wait, no, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but since the book ends at 488, the last partial cycle is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in each full cycle of 10, each digit appears once in the units place, so for 48 full cycles, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times. Then, in the partial cycle from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, units place contributes equally to both digits.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. But wait, in the first 10 numbers (1-10), the tens digit is 0, so 0 appears 10 times, and each other digit from 1-9 appears 10 times in their respective blocks.\n\nBut since our book goes up to 488, let's break it down:\n\nFrom 1-99: the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nFrom 100-488: Let's consider this as 100-488, which is 389 numbers. The tens digit in this range cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. So, for 100-199, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each, so 4 appears 10 times (140-149) and 8 appears 10 times (180-189). Similarly, for 200-299, same thing: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times. For 300-399, same again. Now, 400-488: the tens digit here goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the end). So, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). Let me calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409 (10 numbers), 1 for 410-419, up to 8 for 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the end). So, for the tens digit:\n\n- 4 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 8 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 times.\n\nSo, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, let's add up the tens place counts:\n\nFrom 1-99: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-399: Each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8, so 3 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contribute 3*10=30 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nFrom 400-488: 10 times for 4, 9 times for 8.\n\nSo total tens place:\n\n4's: 10 (from 1-99) + 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 times.\n\n8's: 10 (from 1-99) + 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check again. From 1-99, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. From 100-399, each hundred adds another 10 times, so 3 hundreds give 30 times each. From 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So yes, 50 for 4 and 49 for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards. So, let's see:\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 4 and 8 don't appear here in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4 or 8.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so again, no 4 or 8.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, in this range, every page from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1,2,3, or 4, but never 8.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n4's: 89 times.\n\n8's: 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 50 times.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 49 times.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFrom 1-480, how many full decades are there? 480 /10 = 48, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 to 4 and 8 in units place. Then, from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1 =49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-99: 10 each.\n\nFrom 100-399: 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 for 4 and 10 for 8, so 30 each.\n\nFrom 400-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 10 for 4, 9 for 8.\n\nTotal tens place: 10 + 30 +10=50 for 4; 10 +30 +9=49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in hundreds place. 8 never appears here.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 =98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Hmm, okay, that makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each place and calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So in every block of 10, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10, and then 8 extra pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). \n\nIn each complete block of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in this partial block, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\nTotal units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\nSo so far, units place contributes equally to both 4 and 8.\n\nNext, let's consider the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place over 100 numbers. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly for 8 in 80-89, 10 times.\n\nNow, how many hundreds do we have here? 488 pages mean we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. So for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 for 4's and 4*10=40 for 8's.\n\nNow, looking at the last partial hundred, 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). Wait, no, let me think. Wait, 401-488 is 88 pages. So in terms of tens digits:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers, since 488-480=8)\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so from 481 to 488, the tens digit is 8, and there are 8 numbers here. So, in the tens place for 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? It's only in 441-450, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times in the partial hundred.\n\nSo total tens place 4's: 4*10 (from the full hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\nTotal tens place 8's: 4*10 (from the full hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nWait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, but only up to 488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times, not 10.\n\nWait, but in each full hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). So for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10=40. Then in the partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So total 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place: in each full hundred, 4 appears 10 times (40-49). So 4*10=40. In the partial hundred, 441-450 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSo now, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 48.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check that again. In the partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, 401-410: 0, 411-420:1, 421-430:2, 431-440:3, 441-450:4, 451-460:5, 461-470:6, 471-480:7, 481-488:8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nSo yes, 4's in tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) +10=50\n8's in tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) +8=48\n\nSo, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case because the book has 488 pages. So from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're starting at 1, maybe we can ignore that. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, because 800 would be beyond 488. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So 8 never appears in the hundreds place here.\n\nSo, hundreds place contributions:\n\n4's: 89\n8's: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits: 49\nTens: 50\nHundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits: 49\nTens: 48\nHundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) equals 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n488 pages, so 48 complete tens (48*10=480), plus 8 pages (481-488). In each complete ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So 48 each. Then in the last 8 pages, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So 48+1=49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each full hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So for 4 hundreds, that's 40 each. Then in the partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+8=48 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times (from 400-488), and 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So yes, 89 times. So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 91. So there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for the partial hundred? From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So that's 8 times. So 8's in tens place: 40 +8=48. That seems correct.\n\nAnd 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, since 441-450 is 10 numbers. So yes, 50.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, correct.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49+50+89=188\n8's total: 49+48=97\nDifference: 188-97=91\n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all the digits correctly. Maybe I should break it down more systematically.\n\nAnother approach: for each digit position, count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet's do it for units, tens, and hundreds separately.\n\nUnits digit:\n\nTotal numbers: 488\n\nNumber of times each digit 0-9 appears in units place: floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once.\n\nSo units 4's: 48 +1=49\nUnits 8's:48 +1=49\n\nTens digit:\n\nEach cycle of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So for 488 pages, we have 4 full hundreds (1-400) and 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, 4 appears 10 times in tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSo for 4 hundreds: 4*10=40 for 4's, 4*10=40 for 8's.\n\nIn the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488: 8 numbers\n\nSo in the partial hundred, 4's in tens place:10, 8's:8\n\nTotal tens 4's:40 +10=50\nTotal tens 8's:40 +8=48\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nOnly pages 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, which is 89 numbers. So 4 appears 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in hundreds place because 800>488.\n\nSo hundreds 4's:89\nHundreds 8's:0\n\nNow, sum them up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n- Total complete blocks of 10: 48 (480 pages).\n- Remaining pages: 8 (481-488).\n- 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n- 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n- Total complete blocks of 100: 4 (400 pages).\n- Remaining pages: 88 (401-488).\n- 4's: 4*10 (from 400 pages) + 10 (441-450) = 50.\n- 8's: 4*10 (from 400 pages) + 8 (481-488) = 48.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears in 400-488: 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}."

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Because page numbers go from 1 to 488, I need to check how many times the digits 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For every set of ten pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once (like in 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (like in 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, if I can figure out how many complete sets of ten there are in 488 pages, I can multiply that by 1 to get the number of times each digit appears in the units place.\n\nBut wait, 488 isn't a multiple of ten. So, I should calculate how many complete sets of ten there are and then check the remaining pages.\n\nTotal pages: 488\nNumber of complete tens: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten, and 8 extra pages.\n\nIn each complete set of ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that's 48 times each for both digits.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 pages (from 481 to 488) would be 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Let's check the units digits here:\n\n481: units digit is 1\n482: 2\n483: 3\n484: 4\n485: 5\n486: 6\n487: 7\n488: 8\n\nSo, in these extra pages, the units digit is 4 once (484) and 8 once (488). So, adding that, the total for units place is:\n\n4's: 48 (from the sets) + 1 (from extra) = 49\n8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nHmm, so in the units place, they're equal. So, no difference there.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in 0-99, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49), and 8 ten times (80-89).\n\nSo, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages?\n\nTotal hundreds: 4 (since 400 is the start of the 5th hundred, but we only go up to 488). Wait, actually, 488 is in the 4th hundred (400-499), but we only go up to 488, so it's part of the 4th hundred.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as how many complete hundreds there are. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages in the 5th hundred (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each.\n\nNow, for the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, how many times do 4 and 8 appear?\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place:\n\n- For 4's: The tens digit is 4 when the page is 440-449. But wait, in the 401-488 range, 440-449 is included, so that's 10 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 449 exist? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in this partial hundred.\n\n- For 8's: The tens digit is 8 when the page is 480-488. That's 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this partial hundred.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if 480 is included. Since the book starts at page 1 and goes up to 488, 480 is within that range, so yes, 480-488 is 9 pages (including both 480 and 488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this partial hundred.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50\n8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's are one more than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-499 would have hundreds digit 4, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can only be up to 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, 4 is way more than 8 in this place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit across all places.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations, especially the hundreds place.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That's correct because each page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, which is 89 pages.\n\nFor the tens place, in the partial hundred (401-488), I considered the tens digit as 4 for 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 for 480-488, which is 9 times. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, I had 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8, plus the extra 8 pages contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 49 each, which adds up correctly.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place, for the partial hundred, I thought 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times, but let me confirm.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for tens digit 4, the pages would be 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, 440 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 pages.\n\nFor tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is included). So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is a significant number. So, that's why the total for 4's is so much higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by counting each digit's occurrence in each place separately.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet me try this for each place.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal pages: 488\n\nNumber of times each digit appears in units place:\n\nFor each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place is floor(488/10) + (1 if the remainder is >= d else 0). Wait, but that's not exactly accurate because for digits beyond 0, it's a bit different.\n\nWait, actually, for the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each set of ten, except possibly the last incomplete set.\n\nSo, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is:\n\nnumber_of_complete_tens = 488 // 10 = 48\nremainder = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\ncount = 48 * 1 + (1 if 4 <= 8 else 0) = 48 + 1 = 49\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\ncount = 48 * 1 + (1 if 8 <= 8 else 0) = 48 + 1 = 49\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit appears 10 times in each hundred. So, number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 488 // 100 = 4), and the remainder is 88 pages.\n\nFor each digit d in the tens place:\n\ncount = (complete_hundreds) * 10 + count_in_remainder\n\nFor d=4:\n\nIn the remainder (88 pages, which is 0-88 in the tens place), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 40-49, which is 10 pages, but since the remainder is 88, which is more than 49, so yes, 40-49 is entirely within 0-88. So, count_in_remainder = 10.\n\nThus, total for d=4: 4 * 10 + 10 = 50\n\nFor d=8:\n\nIn the remainder, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 80-88, which is 9 pages (since 88 is the upper limit). So, count_in_remainder = 9.\n\nThus, total for d=8: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 100 pages, and the hundreds digit is the same for all pages in that hundred.\n\nFor d=4:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 in pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, count = 89.\n\nFor d=8:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, d=8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, count = 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that's consistent with what I had earlier. So, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me check the hundreds place again because that seems like a big number. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so yes, 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nWait, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Analyze Each Digit Place Separately:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n     - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n     - Remaining pages: 8 (481-488).\n     - '4' appears once in units place for each set: 48 + 1 = 49.\n     - '8' appears once in units place for each set: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n     - Total complete hundreds: 4 (1-400).\n     - Remaining pages: 88 (401-488).\n     - '4' appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred: 4*10 = 40.

    "text": " Let me break this down step by step. I'm going to think about each digit place separately because page numbers can have one, two, or three digits. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit. I should consider each of these ranges separately to count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, let's think about single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits are just the numbers themselves. So, the digit 4 appears once (on page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (on page 8). So, in single-digit pages, there's a tie: 1 four and 1 eight. So, the count for 4's and 8's is equal here.\n\nNext, let's move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place for two-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 1 to 9. So, for the tens digit being 4, the pages would be from 40 to 49. That's 10 pages, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, the pages are from 80 to 89, which is another 10 pages, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. For each set of ten pages (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (e.g., 18, 28, etc.). Since there are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and the same for 8, appearing 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up the two-digit numbers: in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times. In the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 9 times. So, total for two-digit pages, 4's would be 10 + 9 = 19 times, and 8's would be 10 + 9 = 19 times. So, again, they are equal in two-digit pages.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is where it might get a bit more complicated because the hundreds digit can vary, and the tens and units digits can also vary, but the maximum page is 488, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4, and the tens and units digits go up to 8 in some cases.\n\nLet me break this down by each digit place: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's count in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can range from 0 to 9, and the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, I need to be careful in the 400-488 range.\n\nFirst, let's consider the tens digit when the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3. For each of these, the tens digit can be 0-9, so for each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3), the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundreds digit, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundreds digit (180-189, 280-289, 380-389). So, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, the tens digit 4 appears 3 times 10 = 30 times, and the same for 8, 30 times.\n\nNow, for the hundreds digit 4 (pages 400-488), the tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, which is 9 possibilities. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, when the tens digit is 4, the pages would be 440-449, but wait, 449 is within 488, so that's 10 pages. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is okay because 449 < 488. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place when hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place when hundreds digit is 4: the tens digit would be 8, so pages 480-488. That's 9 pages (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check that. For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can go from 0 to 8, so when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8 (since the last page is 488). So, for tens digit 8, the units digits go from 0 to 8, which is 9 pages (480 to 488). So, that's correct: 9 times for 8 in the tens place when hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, adding up, for the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Digit 4: 30 (from hundreds digits 1,2,3) + 10 (from hundreds digit 4) = 40 times\n- Digit 8: 30 (from hundreds digits 1,2,3) + 9 (from hundreds digit 4) = 39 times\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me make sure. For hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place, so 3*10=30 each. Then, for hundreds digit 4, 4 in tens place is 10 times (440-449), and 8 in tens place is 9 times (480-488). So, yes, 40 and 39.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit can be 0-9, and we'll have to consider each hundreds digit separately, again being careful with hundreds digit 4.\n\nStarting with hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: For each of these, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit. So, for each hundreds digit, in each ten's group (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the units digit 4 appears once (e.g., 104, 114, etc.), and the same for 8 (e.g., 108, 118, etc.).\n\nSince there are 10 tens groups for each hundreds digit (0-9), and each group has one 4 and one 8 in the units place, each hundreds digit contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the units place. So, that's 3*10=30 for 4 and 3*10=30 for 8.\n\nNow, for hundreds digit 4 (pages 400-488), the units digit can go up to 8 when the tens digit is 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, we need to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nLet's consider each tens digit for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Tens digit 0: pages 400-409. Units digits 0-9, so 4 appears once (404) and 8 appears once (408).\n- Tens digit 1: pages 410-419. Units digits 0-9, so 4 appears once (414) and 8 appears once (418).\n- Similarly, tens digits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7: each will have 4 and 8 in the units place once per tens group, so that's 7 tens digits, each contributing 1 for 4 and 1 for 8.\n- Tens digit 8: pages 480-488. Units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Wait, but 484 is within 488, so yes, it's included. So, in this case, for tens digit 8, units digit 4 appears once, and units digit 8 appears once.\n\nWait, but wait: when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8, so 480-488. So, units digits are 0-8, which is 9 numbers. So, in this case, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, when the tens digit is 8, the units digits go up to 8, so for 4 in units place, it's 484, and for 8, it's 488. So, each appears once.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 4, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: each has units digits 0-9, so 8 tens digits (0-7), each contributing one 4 in units place, so 8 times.\n- Tens digit 8: contributes one 4 in units place (484).\nSo, total for 4 in units place for hundreds digit 4: 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: each has units digits 0-9, so 8 tens digits, each contributing one 8 in units place, so 8 times.\n- Tens digit 8: contributes one 8 in units place (488).\nSo, total for 8 in units place for hundreds digit 4: 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8, so 488 is included, but 489 would be beyond the page count. So, yes, 488 is included, so 8 appears once in the units place for tens digit 8.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 4, units place:\n\n- 4 appears 9 times\n- 8 appears 9 times\n\nWait, but let me recount. For hundreds digit 4, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times, correct.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's also 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up for the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4 appears 30 (from hundreds digits 1,2,3) + 9 (from hundreds digit 4) = 39 times\n- 8 appears 30 (from hundreds digits 1,2,3) + 9 (from hundreds digit 4) = 39 times\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the counts for 4's and 8's across all digit places and page ranges.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages:\n\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit pages:\n\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit pages:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4: 89\n  - 8: 0\n- Tens place:\n  - 4: 40\n  - 8: 39\n- Units place:\n  - 4: 39\n  - 8: 39\n\nSo, total for 4's:\n\n1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = let's add them up step by step.\n\n1 + 19 = 20\n20 + 89 = 109\n109 + 40 = 149\n149 + 39 = 188\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\n\nTotal for 8's:\n\n1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = \n\n1 + 19 = 20\n20 + 0 = 20\n20 + 39 = 59\n59 + 39 = 98\n\nSo, total 8's: 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, single-digit:\n\n4:1, 8:1. Correct.\n\nTwo-digit:\n\nTens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Units place: 9 times each (14,24,...,89). So, 10+9=19 for both. Correct.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times (400-488). 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place, so 3*10=30 each.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 4 in tens place appears 10 times (440-449), 8 in tens place appears 9 times (480-488). So, 30+10=40 for 4, 30+9=39 for 8. Correct.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8, so 3*10=30 each.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times. So, 30+9=39 each. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 89 + 40 + 39 = 188\n\n8's: 1 + 19 + 0 + 39 + 39 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers are as follows:\n\n- Pages 1 to 9: one-digit numbers\n- Pages 10 to 99: two-digit numbers\n- Pages 100 to 488: three-digit numbers\n\nI think I should count the number of times the digit 4 appears in each of these ranges and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **One-digit numbers (1-9):**\n   - The digit 4 appears once, which is on page 4.\n\n2. **Two-digit numbers (10-99):**\n   - Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place.\n   - Tens place: The numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n   - Units place: For each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 tens (10-99), so 9 times 4 appears in the units place.\n   - So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit numbers (100-488):**\n   - Let's break this down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n   - Hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens and units digits are limited.\n   - Let's handle each hundred separately.\n\n   a. **Hundreds digit = 1 (100-199):**\n      - Tens place: The digit 4 can appear in the tens place. So, for each hundred, the tens digit can be 0-9. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n      - Units place: Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit is 4 once every ten numbers. So, from 100-199, the units digit is 4 for 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the units place.\n      - So, total 4's in 100-199: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20.\n\n   b. **Hundreds digit = 2 (200-299):**\n      - Same logic as above.\n      - Tens place: 240-249: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n      - Units place: 204, 214, ..., 294: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n      - Total 4's: 20.\n\n   c. **Hundreds digit = 3 (300-399):**\n      - Tens place: 340-349: 10 numbers.\n      - Units place: 304, 314, ..., 394: 10 numbers.\n      - Total 4's: 20.\n\n   d. **Hundreds digit = 4 (400-488):**\n      - Now, this is a bit trickier because the range doesn't go up to 499 but stops at 488.\n      - Let's break it down further.\n\n      i. **Tens place:**\n         - The tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n         - When the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, right? Let me check: 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included.\n         - So, 440-449: 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n      ii. **Units place:**\n         - The units digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page, the units digit goes up to 8 when the tens digit is 8).\n         - So, for each ten (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488), the units digit is 4 once.\n         - Let's see how many tens there are. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, 9 tens (0-8).\n         - However, the last ten is 480-488, which only has 9 numbers (480-488). But the units digit 4 appears once here as 484.\n         - So, for each ten, the units digit 4 appears once, except maybe the last one? Wait, no, because 480-488 includes 484, so it's still one occurrence.\n         - So, total units place 4's: 9 times.\n\n      iii. **Hundreds place:**\n         - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488, so that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n         - So, that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\n      - So, adding up:\n        - Hundreds place: 89\n        - Tens place: 10\n        - Units place: 9\n        - Total 4's in 400-488: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108.\n\n   - So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 20 (100-199) + 20 (200-299) + 20 (300-399) + 108 (400-488) = 20 + 20 + 20 + 108 = 168.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the three-digit numbers, especially the 400-488 part.\n\nWait, when I counted the hundreds digit as 4, I said it's 89 times. But 488 - 400 + 1 = 89, so that's correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nIn the units place, for each ten (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488), the units digit 4 appears once. Since the tens digits go from 0 to 8, that's 9 tens. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, 89 + 10 + 9 = 108. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 20 + 20 + 20 + 108 = 168.\n\nWait, but 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 each have 20 4's, so 20*3 = 60, plus 108 in 400-488, total 168. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **One-digit numbers (1-9):**\n   - The digit 8 appears once, which is on page 8.\n\n2. **Two-digit numbers (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: The numbers are 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n   - Units place: For each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the digit 8 appears once in the units place. There are 9 tens, so 9 times.\n   - So, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit numbers (100-488):**\n   - Again, breaking down by hundreds, tens, and units.\n\n   a. **Hundreds digit = 1 (100-199):**\n      - Tens place: The digit 8 can appear in the tens place. So, for 180-189: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n      - Units place: For each ten (100-109, 110-119, ..., 190-199), the units digit is 8 once. So, 10 times (108, 118, ..., 198).\n      - So, total 8's in 100-199: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20.\n\n   b. **Hundreds digit = 2 (200-299):**\n      - Same logic:\n      - Tens place: 280-289: 10 times.\n      - Units place: 208, 218, ..., 298: 10 times.\n      - Total 8's: 20.\n\n   c. **Hundreds digit = 3 (300-399):**\n      - Tens place: 380-389: 10 times.\n      - Units place: 308, 318, ..., 398: 10 times.\n      - Total 8's: 20.\n\n   d. **Hundreds digit = 4 (400-488):**\n      - Now, let's handle this carefully because the range stops at 488.\n\n      i. **Tens place:**\n         - The tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page.\n         - When the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488).\n         - So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times.\n\n      ii. **Units place:**\n         - For each ten (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488), the units digit is 8 once.\n         - The tens digits go from 0 to 8, so 9 tens.\n         - For each ten, the units digit 8 appears once, so 9 times.\n\n      iii. **Hundreds place:**\n         - The hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, but the digit is 4, not 8, so no 8's here.\n\n      - So, adding up:\n        - Tens place: 9\n        - Units place: 9\n        - Total 8's in 400-488: 9 + 9 = 18.\n\n   - So, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 20 (100-199) + 20 (200-299) + 20 (300-399) + 18 (400-488) = 20 + 20 + 20 + 18 = 78.\n\nWait, let me check the hundreds digit 4 part again.\n\nIn the hundreds digit 4, the hundreds place is 4, so no 8's there. In the tens place, when the tens digit is 8, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 appears in the tens place. In the units place, for each ten, 8 appears once, so 9 times.\n\nSo, 9 + 9 = 18. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 20 + 20 + 20 + 18 = 78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's.\n\n**Total 4's:**\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\n- Total: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n**Total 8's:**\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\n- Total: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's:\n\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, let me recount the three-digit 4's. I had 20 for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and 108 for 400-488. So 20*3 = 60 + 108 = 168. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers, I had 20 for each of the first three hundreds and 18 for 400-488, totaling 78. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I might have made a mistake in counting the three-digit numbers, especially for the 400-488 range.\n\nLet me verify the 400-488 part again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n- Tens place: 440-449: 10 times.\n- Units place: For each ten (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488), the units digit 4 appears once. There are 9 tens (0-8), so 9 times.\n- So, 89 + 10 + 9 = 108. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in 400-488:\n\n- Tens place: 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n- Units place: For each ten, 8 appears once. There are 9 tens, so 9 times.\n- So, 9 + 9 = 18. That's correct.\n\nSo, 108 4's and 18 8's in 400-488.\n\nSo, yes, the totals seem correct. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because I might have overcounted the units and tens places in the three-digit numbers. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's digit by digit, considering each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\n**Calculating 4's:**\n\n- **Units place:**\n  - From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n  - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total groups of 10: 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, with 8 remaining numbers.\n  - So, 48 times 1 = 48, plus one more if the last group has a 4. The last number is 488, so the last group is 481-488. 484 is in this group, so one more.\n  - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- **Tens place:**\n  - Similarly, 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, 10 times each cycle.\n  - From 1 to 488, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, ..., 401-488).\n  - Wait, actually, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.\n  - So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n  - So, for the first four hundreds (0-399), each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. That's 4 * 10 = 40.\n  - Now, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n  - So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- **Hundreds place:**\n  - The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers (as 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n  - So, 89 times.\n\n- **Total 4's:**\n  - Units: 49\n  - Tens: 50\n  - Hundreds: 89\n  - Total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Calculating 8's:**\n\n- **Units place:**\n  - Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers.\n  - From 1 to 488, number of full tens: 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, with 8 remaining.\n  - So, 48 times 1 = 48, plus one more if the last group has an 8. The last number is 488, so 488 is included, so one more.\n  - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- **Tens place:**\n  - 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, 10 times each cycle.\n  - From 1 to 488, how many full hundreds? 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and 400-488.\n  - In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n  - So, for the first four hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40.\n  - In 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488).\n  - So, tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- **Hundreds place:**\n  - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n  - So, 0 times.\n\n- **Total 8's:**\n  - Units: 49\n  - Tens: 49\n  - Hundreds: 0\n  - Total: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, using this digit-by-digit approach, I get the same totals: 188 4's and 98 8's.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe I overcounted, but using this method, I get the same result, so I think it's correct.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **One-digit numbers (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit numbers (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: Each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99) has one 4 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit numbers (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: 440-449 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: Each ten (100-109, ..., 480-488) has one 4 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108.\n   - **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 108 = 128.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **One-digit numbers (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 8).\n   - **Two-digit numbers (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: Each ten has one 8 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit numbers (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 0 occurrences (no page 800-899).\n     - Tens place: 480-488 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Units place: Each ten has one 8 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 9 + 9 = 18.\n   - **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 18 = 38.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Total 4's: 128\n   - Total 8's: 38\n   - Difference: 128 - 38 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm going to think out loud, so maybe I'll make some mistakes, but I'll try to correct them as I go.\n\nFirst, I know that each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and each number is printed once. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nHmm, maybe it's easier to count the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once in the units place every 10 numbers.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, let me see how many complete blocks of 10 there are and if there's a partial block.\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488).\n\nIn each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears once in the units place (8, 18, 28, etc.).\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1 (from each block) plus any extra in the partial block. Wait, but in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred block. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99.\n\nSo, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89).\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401 to 488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, 4's in the tens place: 10 times, 8's in the tens place: 10 times. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10=40 for both 4's and 8's.\n\nNow, the partial hundred from 401 to 488. Let's look at the tens digits here. The numbers are from 401 to 488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, actually, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: tens digit 1, up to 480-488: tens digit 8.\n\nSo, in this partial hundred, the tens digit is 4 for the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4's: 10 times, 8's: 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial hundred) = 50.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from partial hundred) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's. That's a difference of +1 for 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 have 0 in the hundreds place, pages 100-199 have 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles every 100, so 8 would be in the hundreds place for 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, hundreds place: 4's: 89, 8's: 0. So, difference here is +89 for 4's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in units. 488 pages mean 48 full blocks (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n- In units place, 48 blocks give 48 4's and 48 8's. The extra 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, units 8's: 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each block of 100 has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. 4 full hundreds (400 pages) give 4*10=40 each.\n- Partial block from 401-488: tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488).\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n- So, total tens 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, tens 8's: 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\nDifference:188 -98=90\n\nWait, but let me check if the hundreds place count is correct. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but another way to check: 400-488 is 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for the partial block? From 401-488, the tens digits:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\nWait, no, wait. Wait, 401-410: tens digit 0, units 1-10\n411-420: tens digit 1, units 1-10\n421-430: tens digit 2\n431-440: tens digit 3\n441-450: tens digit 4\n451-460: tens digit 5\n461-470: tens digit 6\n471-480: tens digit 7\n481-490: tens digit 8, but our book ends at 488, so only up to 488.\n\nWait, so in the tens digit, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, but wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, 8 appears 8 times in the tens place? Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, 481-490 would have tens digit 8, but we only go up to 488, so that's 8 numbers: 481,482,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 9 times, but now I'm thinking it's 8 times. Wait, no, because 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. But wait, 480 is included in the previous hundred? Wait, no, 401-488 is the partial hundred, so 480 is part of this.\n\nWait, let's clarify. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears for 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480 is included in 401-488, so yes, 480 is part of this partial hundred. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 in the tens place. So, my initial calculation was correct: 9 times.\n\nWait, but when I thought about 481-488, that's 8 numbers, but 480 is also included, making it 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's:10, 8's:9. So, total tens 4's:40+10=50, tens 8's:40+9=49.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: For the partial hundred from 401-488, how many times does the tens digit equal 4 and 8.\n\n- Tens digit 4: occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n- Tens digit 8: occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, yes, 10 and 9 respectively.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times. So, correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by considering each digit place separately and using a formula.\n\nFor the units place, the number of times a digit d appears is given by (n // 10) + (1 if d <= (n % 10) else 0). Similarly, for the tens place, it's (n // 100) * 10 + min(max((n % 100) - (d * 10) + 1, 0), 10) if d != 0 else (n // 100) * 10.\n\nWait, maybe that's too complicated, but perhaps I can use a formula for each digit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\n\nFor units digit:\nNumber of 4's = (488 // 10) + (1 if 4 <= (488 % 10) else 0) = 48 + (1 if 4 <= 8 else 0) = 48 +1=49\nSimilarly, number of 8's = (488 //10) + (1 if 8 <=8 else 0)=48+1=49\n\nFor tens digit:\nNumber of 4's = (488 // 100)*10 + (if (488 % 100) >= 40 then (488 % 100 -40 +1) else 0)\nSo, 488//100=4, so 4*10=40\n488%100=88, which is >=40, so 88-40+1=49\nWait, but that can't be right because 40 to 488 in tens place would be more than that. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, no, actually, for the tens digit, each hundred contributes 10 times the digit, and then the partial hundred contributes the remainder.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to stick with the initial method.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. My initial approach seems correct, so I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488).\n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48. Similarly, the number of 8's is also 48.\n\nBut wait, there are 8 extra numbers: 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits here. The units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly for 8.\n\nSo, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). So, for each hundred, that's 10 times each. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear here.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). Wait, so in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nLooking at 440-449, that's 10 times, but wait, our range is 401-488. So, 440-449 is entirely within this range, so that's 10 times for 4 in the tens place. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 times. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 times here.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, how many numbers are there? For example, 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers. 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers, and so on up to 480-488: tens digit 8, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears in the 440-449 range, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the extra 88 numbers, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous 40 times each from the complete hundreds, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems off because I thought 8's in the tens place would be 49, but let me check again.\n\nWait, no, from the complete hundreds, it's 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8. Then, in the extra 88 numbers, 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). So, total for 4's in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8's, it's 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that makes sense because 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the extra part.\n\nSo, moving on to the hundreds place. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers (400-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, no, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8. In the tens place, 50 for 4 and 49 for 8. In the hundreds place, 89 for 4 and 0 for 8.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should consider all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nHmm, maybe I can approach this by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. That might make it easier to count without missing any numbers.\n\nLet's start by considering the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8.\n\nSo, if I have 488 pages, that's 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives me 48 full groups of 10, with 8 left over. So, in the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the leftover numbers. The leftover numbers are 481 to 488, so the units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in the leftover, there's one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488). So, units place: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so when I count up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place, for each group of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once. So, for 48 full groups, that's 48 each, and then in the last 8 numbers, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 4's = 48 +1=49, 8's=48 +1=49. So, units place: both have 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89).\n\nSo, how many hundreds do we have in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, 4's in tens place: 4 *10 =40, 8's: 4*10=40.\n\nNow, in the leftover pages, which are 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, 401-410: tens digit is 0, so no. 411-420: tens digit 1, no. 421-430: tens digit 2, no. 431-440: tens digit 3, no. 441-450: tens digit 4, so that's 10 times. Wait, but 488 is the end, so from 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in 480-488, but that's only 9 numbers because 488 is the last. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4's: 10, 8's:9.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. The digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, right? Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place for the leftover 88 pages, 4's:10, 8's:9.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4's = 4*10 +10=50, 8's=4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nThe digit 8 in the hundreds place would be if the hundreds digit were 8, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's=49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's=49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 =90.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, earlier I thought in the tens place, 4's were 50 and 8's were 49, but let me confirm.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\nFull hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400): each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for 4's, 4*10=40 for 8's.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449: 10 times, and 8 in 480-488:9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place: 4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8. 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, in the leftover 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 4's=48+1=49, 8's=48+1=49.\n\nHundreds place: 4's from 400-488: 89 times, 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something in the hundreds place. Let me think again.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for 8's, since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0.\n\nSo, yes, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, but I'm a bit unsure if I counted correctly in the tens place. Let me check that again.\n\nIn the tens place, for each full hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's. So, 4*10=40 each.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449:10 times, and 8 in 480-488:9 times.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, 4's:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48 groups, each contributing 1 of each digit.\n   - Leftover numbers (481-488): 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each full hundred (e.g., 1-100) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - Last partial hundred (401-488): 440-449 contributes 10 4's, and 480-488 contributes 9 8's.\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488 contributes 89 4's.\n   - No page numbers have an 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe digit 4 appears 90 times more than the digit 8 in the page numbers.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step. I think I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8, and then subtract the two counts to find the difference. \n\nFirst, I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), and 3-digit (100-488). I need to count the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. Units place: For the units digit, the 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group from 481 to 488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 would be included. So, actually, there's one more 4 in the units place, making it 49 times.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should think differently. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so for each 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades, which is 488 // 10 = 48, plus one if the last number is 488, but wait, 488's units digit is 8, so no extra 4 there. Wait, but 484 is in the units place, so maybe I'm missing that. Let me check: from 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit equal 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. So, the number of such numbers is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens digit, the 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers every 100 numbers. So, for example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nLet's see: The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 50 times.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 400, 401, ..., 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so that's included. So, the number of such numbers is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that block. So, each full block (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block, 480-488, contributes 9 8's (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in all of 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers here.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, then 180-189 (another 10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full blocks of 10, and one partial block of 9. So, total 4*10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 1 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because earlier I thought the hundreds place for 8 would be zero, but let me check again. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but since the book has only 488 pages, the highest page number is 488, which is in the 400s. So, yes, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480 is the first, and 488 is the last, so that's 9 numbers. So, 4 full blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49.\n\nNow, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 in units place. Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 +1=480/10+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 8's would have some numbers, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's correct that there are none. So, 90 is the correct difference.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I was counting the 4's in the hundreds place, I included 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 +1=89. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. The number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to count. For example, for each digit place, count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so total number is floor(488/10) + (if the last number is >=4, add 1). Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, and since 488's units digit is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49. Same as before.\n\n- 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so floor(488/10)=48, and since 488's units digit is 8, add 1, so 49. Same as before.\n\nFor tens place:\n\n- 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, number of blocks is floor(488/100)=4, which gives 4*10=40. But wait, in the last block, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit cycles again. So, perhaps the correct way is to calculate how many full blocks of 100 there are, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, plus any partial block.\n\nWait, perhaps a better formula is:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to N is:\n\nsum = 0\nfor each hundred block:\n    sum += 10 if the tens digit is >= d\n    if the current block's tens digit is exactly d, add the units digits from 0 to the last digit.\n\nWait, maybe it's getting complicated. Alternatively, I can think that for the tens place, the number of 4's is:\n\nFor each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488):\n\n- In 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers\n- In 100-199: 140-149: 10\n- In 200-299: 240-249:10\n- In 300-399:340-349:10\n- In 400-488:440-449:10 (since 449 is less than 488)\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So, total 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nIn each hundred block:\n\n- 0-99:80-89:10\n- 100-199:180-189:10\n- 200-299:280-289:10\n- 300-399:380-389:10\n- 400-488:480-488:9 (since 488 is the end)\n\nSo, 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears in 400-488:89 times\n- 8 appears nowhere, so 0 times.\n\nSo, again, total 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49=98, difference=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

I'll start by understanding the problem and then break it down into smaller parts to count the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nFirst, the book has pages numbered from 1 to 488, and each page number is printed once. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Because each digit can appear in any of these positions, I should count them in each position and then add them up.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Then from 11 to 20, it's 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 again, and so on.\n\nSo, for each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. Therefore, in each block of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8 numbers (from 481 to 488). But wait, let me think again. Actually, the number of complete blocks is 48, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the last partial block, which is 481 to 488, is 8 numbers. Let me check the units digits in this last block: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 each appear 48 times from the complete blocks plus once in the partial block, making it 49 times each.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the last page is 488, so the partial block is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is page 488, so the units digits go up to 8, so yes, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place in the partial block. So, total units place: 49 times each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. Wait, actually, from 1-99, the tens digit cycles 10 times each, but starting from 0. Hmm, perhaps a better way is to consider that in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, etc., up to 9 for 90-99, and then 100 has a tens digit of 0. But wait, 100 is actually in the hundreds place, so maybe I should adjust that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of each hundred as 1-100, 101-200, etc. So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each, except for the last hundred, which might be incomplete.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so we have four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488.\n\nWait, no, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, let me see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488.\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, from 1-400, that's four hundreds, so 4 times 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. Now, what about the last partial hundred, 401-488?\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, the digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nSo, in 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 440-449 would have 4 in the tens place, but wait, 401-488: the tens digits are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488).\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, but wait, 441-450 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nWait, but 488 is page 488, so 481-488 is only 8 numbers, but the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, so in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times (from 481 to 488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for all of 481-490, but since we stop at 488, it's only 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, so 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, which appears only 8 times because we stop at 488.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for example, 401-410: tens digit 0, 411-420: tens digit 1, and so on up to 481-490: tens digit 8. But since we only go up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous four hundreds, which each had 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place, the total for the tens place would be:\n\n4 appears: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 10 in 401-488, so total 50 times.\n\n8 appears: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 8 in 401-488, so total 48 times.\n\nWait, that can't be right because in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit for 8 would appear 10 times, but in the last partial hundred, it's only 8 times. So, total for 8 in tens place is 4\u00d710 + 8 = 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the tens place, it's 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but that seems correct because in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times, same for 8 in 80-89, 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, in 101-200, the tens digit 4 appears in 140-149, 10 times, and 8 in 180-189, 10 times.\n\nSame for 201-300: 240-249, 10 times, and 280-289, 10 times.\n\nAnd 301-400: 340-349, 10 times, and 380-389, 10 times.\n\nThen in 401-488: 440-449, 10 times, and 480-488, which is 8 times.\n\nSo, yes, 4 appears 10 times in each of the first four hundreds, plus 10 times in 401-488, totaling 50 times. 8 appears 10 times in each of the first four hundreds, plus 8 times in 401-488, totaling 48 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, let's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place and how many times 8 appears.\n\nFirst, 8 in the hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, 4 in the hundreds place: from page 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (including both 400 and 488). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188 times.\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, earlier I thought units place for both 4 and 8 was 49 each. Then, tens place: 4 appeared 50 times, 8 appeared 48 times. Hundreds place: 4 appeared 89 times, 8 appeared 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\n8: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, 4 appears 188 times, 8 appears 97 times. The difference would be 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: same logic, 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times, plus in the partial block, 8 appears once (at 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's in tens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, from 1-100, 40-49: 10 times. Similarly, 101-200: 140-149: 10 times, and so on up to 301-400: 340-349: 10 times. Then, 401-488: 440-449: 10 times. So, that's 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 10 in 401-488, totaling 50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Wait, 480 is included, so from 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers, but wait, 480 is the first number, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8 numbers, but maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, let's think: 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all of these 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 401-488.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times, but now I'm seeing it's 9 times. Let me check.\n\nWait, 480 is included, so from 480 to 489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 8 times, but now I'm seeing it's 9 times. So, that changes the count.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 times in each of the first four hundreds, so 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 times in 401-488, totaling 49 times.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought before. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\nEach tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times in a full hundred, but in 401-488, the last tens digit is 8, and it's cut off at 488. So, for tens digit 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 8.\n\nSo, correcting that, the total for 8 in the tens place is 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times in 401-488, so 4\u00d710 +10=50 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, earlier I thought 8 appeared 8 times in the tens place in 401-488, but now I'm seeing it's 9 times.\n\nSo, let me adjust the counts.\n\nSo, digit 4:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nDigit 8:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, so the total for 8 is 98, not 97 as I previously thought. Because in the tens place, it's 49 times, so 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference would be 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm now confused because I thought the tens place for 8 was 9 times in the last partial hundred, making the total 49, which adds up to 98 for 8's.\n\nWait, let me go through each step again carefully.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nEach 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10 in 488: 48 (since 48\u00d710=480). So, 48\u00d71=48 for both 4 and 8.\n\nThen, the last partial block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48+1=49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-400, that's four hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 4\u00d710=40 for both.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nFor 4 in the tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total for tens place:\n\n4: 40 +10=50\n\n8: 40 +9=49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89).\n\n8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n4:89\n\n8:0\n\nNow, adding up:\n\nFor 4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 49+49=98.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the difference is 90.\n\nBut earlier I thought it was 91, but that was because I had miscalculated the tens place for 8 as 8 times instead of 9.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more.\n\nWait, in the tens place, in 401-488, the 8's in the tens place are from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, 40 (from 1-400) +9=49 for 8's in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nUnits place:49 each.\n\nHundreds place:89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, totals:\n\n4:49+50+89=188\n\n8:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly.\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 times.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything else.\n\nWait, is there any other place where 8 could appear? For example, in the hundreds place, but since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit doesn't go beyond 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, the counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - Complete blocks: 48 (since 48 \u00d7 10 = 480), contributing 48 each.\n   - Partial block (481-488): 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 each.\n   - In 401-488:\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 appears 0 times.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Hmm, that sounds a bit involved, but let's take it one digit position at a time.\n\nI remember that when dealing with digit counting problems, it's helpful to consider each digit position separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll need to look at each position in the page numbers.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then adjusting for any remainder.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10, so I need to handle that. Let me think. The total number of complete blocks of 10 in 488 is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then there's a remaining 8 pages (481 to 488). So, for the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, right? Because each block contributes one occurrence. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so digits 1-8 appear once more each, and 9 and 0 don't appear in this partial block.\n\nWait, but 481 is 480 +1, so units digits from 1 to 8. So, for the units digit, the digit 4 appears 48 times (from the complete blocks) plus once more in 484, so total 49 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 48 times plus once more in 488, so total 49 times. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each block of 100. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (11-19), up to 9 (91-99). So, in each 100 numbers, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, since 488 is less than 500, let's see how many complete hundreds we have. There are four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Then, the last part is 401-488.\n\nSo, for each complete hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 400 pages, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40 times each digit appears in the tens place. Now, what about the remaining 88 pages (401-488)?\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 481-488). Wait, no, actually, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (each of 10 pages) and 8 extra pages. Wait, let me think again. 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (each 10 pages) and 8 pages left over. So, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490), but since we're only going up to 488, the last tens digit is 8, but only for 8 pages (481-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears once in the tens place, except for 8, which appears once but only for 8 pages. Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times in the 401-490 range, but since we're stopping at 488, the tens digit 8 appears only 8 times (from 481-488). Wait, that's not correct. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 pages. Let's break it down into tens:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1 (10 pages)\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2 (10 pages)\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3 (10 pages)\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5 (10 pages)\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6 (10 pages)\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7 (10 pages)\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8 (8 pages)\n\nSo, in this partial block, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but the last one only has 8 pages. Therefore, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 8 times here, and all other digits from 0 to 7 appear 10 times each.\n\nSo, for the tens place in the entire book:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 4 complete hundreds * 10 times each = 40 times, plus in the partial block, another 10 times each. So total 50 times each.\n- For digit 8: 4 complete hundreds * 10 times each = 40 times, plus in the partial block, 8 times. So total 48 times.\n- For digit 9: Wait, does 9 appear in the tens place? In 488, the maximum tens digit is 8, so 9 doesn't appear in the tens place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nWait, but I'm only concerned with 4 and 8, so let's focus on those.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial block) = 50 times.\n- Digit 8: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from partial block) = 48 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is more straightforward because it changes less frequently. From 1-99, there's no hundreds digit, so those pages can be ignored. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so 100 times. From 200-299, it's 2, again 100 times. From 300-399, it's 3, 100 times. From 400-488, it's 4, and that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nWait, let me check that: 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and the last is 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 89 times.\n- Digit 8 appears 0 times because the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in 488; the highest is 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. The difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each position.\n\nStarting with digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nNow, digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, in the hundreds place, 8 doesn't appear at all, so 0. So, 49 (units) + 48 (tens) = 97 for 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Did I make a mistake in counting the units place?\n\nWait, earlier I thought both 4 and 8 appeared 49 times in the units place, but let me verify that.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Similarly, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 times, plus once in 488, so 49 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. In the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me double-check each part.\n\nFirst, units place: 4 and 8 each appear 49 times. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For 4, in the complete hundreds, it's 4*10=40, and in the partial block, 10 times (from 441-450), so 50. For 8, in the partial block, only 8 times, so 4*10=40 + 8=48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place in a 488-page book, so 0 times.\n\nAdding up: 49+50+89=188 for 4's, and 49+48+0=97 for 8's. Difference is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for the partial block. Let me go back.\n\nIn the partial block from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is 8 and appears 8 times. So, for digit 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times (from 441-450). For digit 8, it's 8 times (from 481-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times in the partial block.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the complete hundreds, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place, so 4 appears 40+10=50, and 8 appears 40+8=48. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all those pages. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 4's: 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units 49, tens 48, hundreds 0. Total 8's: 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think if I counted correctly in the tens place for the partial block. Wait, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490). But since we stop at 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for digit 4, it's in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For digit 8, it's in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the tens place, each digit from 0-7 appears 10 times in the partial block, and 8 appears 8 times. So, for 4, it's 10 times, and for 8, it's 8 times. So, in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, total for 4: 40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50.\n\nTotal for 8: 40 (from complete hundreds) +8=48.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 400 pages, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 times.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears in the tens place from 441-450, which is 10 times. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: in each hundred, 8 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred, 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, total 40+8=48.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSo, units: 49 each.\n\nTens: 50 for 4, 48 for 8.\n\nHundreds: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference: 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 91, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if 400 is included. Yes, 400 is page 400, so it's included. So, 488-400+1=89.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 times for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, yes, 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 91 seems like a large difference. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nLet me try to count the number of 4's:\n\nUnits place: As before, 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Plus in the last partial block (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, so +1. Total 49.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds *10=40. Plus in the last partial hundred, 441-450, which is 10 pages, so +10. Total 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, 89 pages, so +89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Plus in the last partial block, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so +1. Total 49.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds *10=40. Plus in the last partial hundred, 481-488, which is 8 pages with 8 in the tens place, so +8. Total 48.\n\nHundreds place: 8 never appears, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+48+0=97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I'm still getting 91, which seems correct based on this calculation. So, maybe that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the hundreds place. Is 400-488 inclusive 89 pages? Let's check: 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that from 1-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. So, the difference is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for the partial block. Let me check again.\n\nIn the partial block 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's from 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So, in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50 times.\n\n8 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) +8=48 times.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97.\n\nDifference: 188-97=91.\n\nSo, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to calculate the number of 4's and 8's. Maybe using a formula or a different approach to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) =48, plus if the units digit is >=4, add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if units digit >=8, add 1. Since 8>=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)*10=4*10=40. Then, check the last two digits: 488 mod 100=88. So, the tens digit is 8. Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in the last partial hundred? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449). Wait, no, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, add 10. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in the tens place: floor(488/100)*10=4*10=40. Then, check the last partial hundred: 488 mod 100=88. The tens digit is 8, so how many times does 8 appear in the tens place in the last partial hundred? From 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers? Wait, no, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them except 480, which is 8 in the tens place as well. Wait, 480 is 480, so the tens digit is 8, and it goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the last partial hundred, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. But wait, earlier I thought it was 8 times. Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 numbers, but 480 is also part of the partial hundred. Wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, so 480 is included. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each with tens digit 8. So, that's 9 times. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) +9=49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times. Hmm, that's conflicting with my previous calculation. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers (including 480). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the partial block, not 8.\n\nWait, that changes things. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 40 +9=49 times, not 48.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in 401-488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. But 480 is also part of 401-488, right? Because 401-488 includes 480, which is 480, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 times.\n\nSo, that would mean in the tens place, 8 appears 49 times, not 48. So, that changes the total.\n\nWait, so let me recalculate.\n\nIf in the tens place, 8 appears 49 times, then total 8's would be:\n\nUnits:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 98.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's:\n\nUnits:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so now the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but which is correct? Earlier, I thought that in the partial block, the last group was 481-488, which is 8 numbers, but 480 is also part of the partial block, so it's 9 numbers with tens digit 8.\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 pages. Let's check:\n\n401-488: 488-401+1=88 pages.\n\nIf we break it down:\n\n- 401-410:10 pages (tens digit 0)\n- 411-420:10 pages (tens digit 1)\n- 421-430:10 pages (tens digit 2)\n- 431-440:10 pages (tens digit 3)\n- 441-450:10 pages (tens digit 4)\n- 451-460:10 pages (tens digit 5)\n- 461-470:10 pages (tens digit 6)\n- 471-480:10 pages (tens digit 7)\n- 481-488:8 pages (tens digit 8)\n\nWait, but 480 is part of 471-480, which is 10 pages (471-480). So, 480 is included in the 471-480 block, which has tens digit 7, not 8. Wait, no, 480 is 4-8-0, so the tens digit is 8, right? Wait, no, 480 is 4 8 0, so the tens digit is 8. So, 480 is part of the 480-488 block, which is 9 pages (480-488). So, in that case, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages.\n\nWait, but 471-480 is 10 pages, with tens digit 7, right? 471-480: 471,472,...,480. So, 480 is the 10th page in that block, so the tens digit is 7 for all of them except 480, which is 8 in the tens digit. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, 480 is 4-8-0, so the tens digit is 8, so it's part of the next block, which is 481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nWait, but 480 is actually part of the 480-488 block, which is 9 pages, with tens digit 8. So, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 8 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) +9=49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the tens place, it's 40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50 times.\n\nSo, that means total 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98.\n\nTotal 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 8 times, but it's actually 9 times because 480 is included in the partial block, making it 9 pages with tens digit 8.\n\nSo, that changes the total count. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this again.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits:\n\n- 0: 401-410 (10 pages)\n- 1:411-420 (10)\n- 2:421-430 (10)\n- 3:431-440 (10)\n- 4:441-450 (10)\n- 5:451-460 (10)\n- 6:461-470 (10)\n- 7:471-480 (10)\n- 8:481-488 (8 pages) plus 480 (1 page). Wait, but 480 is part of the 480-488 block, which is 9 pages. So, 480-488 is 9 pages, with tens digit 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the partial block, making it 40+9=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nTotal number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 91, but now it's 90. Which is correct?\n\nI think the confusion was whether 480 is included in the partial block. Since 480 is part of 480-488, which is 9 pages, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial block, so total 49 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 8 times, but now it's 9 times. Let me make sure.\n\n401-488 is 88 pages.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n401-410:10 (tens 0)\n411-420:10 (tens 1)\n421-430:10 (tens 2)\n431-440:10 (tens 3)\n441-450:10 (tens 4)\n451-460:10 (tens 5)\n461-470:10 (tens 6)\n471-480:10 (tens 7)\n481-488:8 (tens 8)\n\nWait, but 480 is included in the 471-480 block, which is 10 pages (471-480). So, 480 is part of that, so the tens digit is 7 for 471-480, because 480 is 4-8-0, so the tens digit is 8, not 7. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the tens digit is determined by the second digit. So, 480 is 4 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 0 (units). So, 480 has tens digit 8, so it's part of the 480-488 block, which is 9 pages (480-488).\n\nWait, but 480 is page 480, which is part of 401-488, so it's included in the partial block. So, the tens digit for 480 is 8, so it's part of the 480-488 group, which is 9 pages (480-488). Therefore, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the partial block.\n\nSo, that's correct. Therefore, the total 8's in the tens place is 49, making the total 8's 98, and 4's 188, difference 90.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought 480 was part of the 471-480 block with tens digit 7, but now I see that's incorrect. 480 is part of the 480-488 block with tens digit 8. So, that's 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nTherefore, the correct difference is 90.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (from 1 to 480).\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 times for each digit in the first 400 pages.\n   - Pages 401-488:\n     - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n   - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the units place. For every block of 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 also appears once. For example, in pages 1-10, 4 appears on page 4 and 8 appears on page 8. This pattern repeats every 10 pages.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra pages. In each of these 48 blocks, both 4 and 8 appear once each in the units place. So, that's 48 times for each digit. Now, looking at the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, the count for units place is equal for both digits.\n\nNext, I'll check the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. For example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, then 10-19 it's 1, and so on. So, the digit 4 in the tens place appears in the range 40-49, which is 10 pages. Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place appears in the range 80-89, which is another 10 pages.\n\nNow, how many complete sets of 100 pages are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete sets of 100 pages, and then 88 extra pages.\n\nIn each set of 100 pages, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100-page block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49) and the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). Since there are 4 complete sets, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for each digit in the tens place across the first 400 pages.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, but wait, 440 is beyond 488, so actually, in the range 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, but 440 is within 401-488, right? Wait, 440 is page 440, which is within 401-488. So, that's 10 pages (440-449). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times here. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so yes, 10 times.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the tens place? That would be in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 40 (from the 400 pages) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times. The digit 8 appears 40 (from the 400 pages) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The first 400 pages have 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit cycles every 100 pages. So, pages 1-99 have hundreds digit 0 (since they're less than 100), but I think in page numbering, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nWait, but in page numbers, do we consider leading zeros? For example, page 5 is written as 5, not 005, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's the number of pages from 400 to 488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because the book ends at 488. The hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the count for 8 in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 488 pages, so 48 full tens and 8 extra pages.\n- Each full ten contributes 1 four and 1 eight.\n- So, 48 * 1 = 48 for each digit.\n- In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 4 hundreds (0-399) contribute 4 * 10 = 40 each.\n- Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 times) and 8 for 480-488 (9 times).\n- So, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n- 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the hundreds place. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit doesn't reach 5 or beyond, so that's correct.\n\nAnd for the digit 8 in the hundreds place, since the book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never gets to 8. So, 0 times is correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Analyze Each Digit Place Separately:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - For every 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n     - 488 pages = 48 full tens + 8 extra pages.\n     - 48 fours and 48 eights from full tens.\n     - Extra pages (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n     - Total units place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each hundred contributes 10 fours (40-49) and 10 eights (80-89).\n     - 400 pages = 4 sets of 100, contributing 40 fours and 40 eights.\n     - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n       - Fours: 10 times (440-449).\n       - Eights: 9 times (480-488).\n     - Total tens place: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - Fours: 89 times (400-488).\n     - Eights: 0 times (book ends at 488).\n   \n2. **Sum the Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n   \n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: the units place and the tens place. Because when you print page numbers, each digit in the number is printed, so I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nSo if I can figure out how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages, I can multiply that by 1 to get the number of 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10, so there are some extra pages beyond the last complete group of 10. Let me calculate how many complete groups there are.\n\nThe total number of pages is 488. So the number of complete groups of 10 is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). \n\nWait, but actually, when counting page numbers, the first page is 1, so from 1 to 488, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (from 1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but wait, 488 is less than 490, so the last group would be 481-488, which is only 8 pages. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place.\n\nFor the units digit, the number of times 4 appears is equal to the number of complete tens times 1, plus if the last partial group includes a 4. Similarly for 8.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each place (units and tens) separately.\n\nLet's start with the units place.\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: For each 10 pages, there is one 4. So from 1 to 488, how many complete tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48*1=48. Now, check if the last partial group (pages 481-488) includes a 4. The units digits in this group are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, page 484 has a 4 in the units place. So total number of 4's in units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: Each group of 10 has one 8. So 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Now, check the last partial group (481-488). The units digits go from 1 to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's another 8. So total 8's in units place is 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, so both 4's and 8's appear 49 times in the units place. So the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, let's check the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in the tens digit when the number is from x40 to x49, where x is the hundreds digit. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens digit when the number is from x80 to x89.\n\nSo for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (from 40-49), and the same for 8 (from 80-89).\n\nNow, let's figure out how many hundreds we have in 488 pages.\n\nWe can think of the page numbers as 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.\n\nSo there are 4 complete hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n\nNow, for each complete hundred, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 10 times. So for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, check the last partial hundred: 400-488.\n\nIn the tens place, the numbers go from 400-488. So the tens digits go from 0 (for 400-409), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), 3 (430-439), 4 (440-449), 5 (450-459), 6 (460-469), 7 (470-479), 8 (480-488).\n\nWait, so in the tens place, for 400-488, how many times does 4 appear? It's in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 488 is less than 490, so 440-449 is fully included, right? Wait, 488 is 488, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's in 480-488. So that's 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 400-488.\n\nWait, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 400-488.\n\nSo total number of 4's in the tens place: 4 hundreds *10=40, plus 10 in 400-488, so 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, total number of 8's in the tens place: 4 hundreds *10=40, plus 9 in 400-488, so 40+9=49.\n\nWait, so 4's in tens place:50, 8's in tens place:49.\n\nSo total number of 4's overall is units + tens: 49+50=99.\n\nTotal number of 8's overall is units + tens:49+49=98.\n\nSo the difference is 99-98=1. So there is one more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for 400-488, the 4's in tens place are from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct. So 10 times.\n\nFor 8's in tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo 4's in tens: 4*10 +10=50.\n\n8's in tens:4*10 +9=49.\n\nUnits place: both 49.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50=99.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:1.\n\nHmm, so that would mean there's one more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, in the units place, for 488 pages, how many 4's?\n\nFrom 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So total 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units: 48 full cycles, 48, plus in the last partial cycle, 8 appears once (488). So 48+1=49.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's: For each hundred, 10 times. 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40. Plus in 400-488, 440-449 is 10, so total 50.\n\n8's in tens: Each hundred, 10 times, 4*10=40. Plus in 400-488, 480-488 is 9, so total 49.\n\nSo 4's total:49+50=99.\n\n8's total:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:99-98=1.\n\nSo the answer should be 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a chance I'm missing something?\n\nWait, when I count the tens place for 400-488, is 440-449 fully included? 440-449 is within 400-488, yes, so that's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nBut 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo 4's in tens:50, 8's in tens:49.\n\nUnits: both 49.\n\nSo total 4's:99, 8's:98.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the answer is 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something with the hundreds place, but in the hundreds place, the digits go from 1 to 4. So 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So the hundreds digit is 4, which would add 89 more 4's. Wait, wait, no, I didn't consider the hundreds place yet. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I only considered units and tens places, but the hundreds place also contributes digits. So I need to account for that.\n\nWait, so let me correct that.\n\nSo each page number is a three-digit number, with hundreds, tens, and units digits. So I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each of the three places.\n\nSo earlier, I only considered units and tens, but I forgot the hundreds place.\n\nSo let's redo this, considering all three places.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's and 8's in the hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from page 400 to 488. So that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\n8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nAs before, in the tens place, 4 appears in each hundred block from x40 to x49, which is 10 times per hundred. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nPlus in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times. So total 4's in tens place:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, 8 in the tens place appears in each hundred block from x80 to x89, which is 10 times per hundred. So 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page). So total 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nNow, units place.\n\nIn the units place, 4 appears once every 10 pages, so for each hundred, there are 10 times (e.g., 4,14,24,...,94). But wait, actually, in each group of 10, it's once. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units place?\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:48 (since 488=48*10 +8). So 48 times, plus in the last partial group (481-488), units digits go up to 8, so 484 is present, adding one more. So total 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, 8 in units place: Each group of 10 contributes once, so 48 times, plus in the last partial group, 488 is present, so one more. So 48+1=49.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place:89\n- Tens place:50\n- Units place:49\nTotal 4's:89+50+49=188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place:0\n- Tens place:49\n- Units place:49\nTotal 8's:0+49+49=98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that's a big difference. So I think I made a mistake earlier by not considering the hundreds place. So the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me verify.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488). So that's a significant number.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nIn the units place, both appear 49 times.\n\nSo total 4's:89+50+49=188.\n\nTotal 8's:0+49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 1, but that was before considering the hundreds place. So the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the hundreds place correct?\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. Each page has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's:89 (hundreds) +50 (tens) +49 (units)=188.\n\n8's:0 (hundreds) +49 (tens) +49 (units)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think earlier I forgot to include the hundreds place, which was a mistake. So the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place:4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nUnits place: both 49 times.\n\nSo total 4's:89+50+49=188.\n\nTotal 8's:0+49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Number of complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 groups.\n   - Remaining pages: 8 (481-488).\n   - **4's:** 48 (from complete groups) + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - **8's:** 48 (from complete groups) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred.\n   - **4's:** 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 10 in 440-449 = 50.\n   - **8's:** 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in 480-488 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** 400-488 includes 89 pages where the hundreds digit is 4.\n   - **8's:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step. I think I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8, and then subtract the two to find the difference. Hmm, sounds straightforward, but I need to make sure I don't miss any cases.\n\nFirst, let me clarify: each page number is printed once, from 1 to 488. So, I need to consider all the digits in all the page numbers. That means I should check each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, how often does 4 and 8 appear? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each block of 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers.\n\nSo, in each block, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 blocks would give 48 fours. Similarly, 48 eights in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. For the tens digit, similar approach. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49) and 8 ten times (80-89). So, for each 100 numbers, 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers left (401-488).\n\nSo, in each of the 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40 fours. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10=40 eights.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), let's check the tens digit. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; and so on up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is tens digit 8.\n\nWait, let me correct that. 401-410: tens digit 0; 411-420: 1; 421-430: 2; 431-440: 3; 441-450: 4; 451-460: 5; 461-470: 6; 471-480: 7; 481-490: 8. But since we only go up to 488, the last block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers (481-488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them.\n\nSo, in the tens place, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digits go through 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each digit appears 10 times except maybe the last one, which only appears 8 times because we stop at 488.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each tens digit appears exactly 10 times except for the last one, which is 8. Wait, no, because 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8 full tens (each 10 numbers) and 8 extra numbers. So, each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488).\n\nWait, no, actually, 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let's break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers\n- 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers\n- 421-430: tens digit 2, 10 numbers\n- 431-440: tens digit 3, 10 numbers\n- 441-450: tens digit 4, 10 numbers\n- 451-460: tens digit 5, 10 numbers\n- 461-470: tens digit 6, 10 numbers\n- 471-480: tens digit 7, 10 numbers\n- 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 numbers\n\nSo, in the tens place, in 401-488:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the last partial hundred, so total 50 fours.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the tens place, for the 4 hundreds (1-400), each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50. And tens place 8's: 4*10 + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. So, 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case, since the book has 488 pages.\n\nSo, from 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (not printed, since page numbers start at 1, but actually, page numbers 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore).\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 100 times, but we're looking for 4's and 8's, so 0 times here.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so again 0 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so 0 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so how many times does 4 appear here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all of these, so 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles every 100, so 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 pages, so 89 fours in the hundreds place, and 0 eights. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, let me add up the totals for each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in the tens place, 4's were 50 and 8's were 48, so that's a difference of 2. In the hundreds place, 89 fours and 0 eights, so difference of 89. Units place, same number of 4's and 8's, so difference of 0. So total difference is 89 + 2 = 91.\n\nBut let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many 4's and 8's in units place.\n\nEach 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight. So, 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, the remaining 8 numbers are 481-488, which are 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units fours: 48 +1=49, units eights:48 +1=49. So, correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach 100 numbers, tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100, 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). Let's break this down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: 1\n- 421-430: 2\n- 431-440: 3\n- 441-450: 4\n- 451-460:5\n- 461-470:6\n- 471-480:7\n- 481-488:8\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 eights.\n\nTherefore, total tens fours: 40 +10=50, tens eights:40 +8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488: 89 numbers, so hundreds digit is 4 for each, so 89 fours. No hundreds digit is 8, so 0 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97.\n\nDifference:188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nIs there any other place where 4 or 8 could appear? Well, we've considered units, tens, and hundreds. Since 488 is a three-digit number, there's no thousands place, so that's all.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's there. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, so no. 200-299: 2, 300-399:3, so no 4's or 8's in hundreds place except for 400-488. So, correct.\n\nAnother way to check: maybe I can calculate the total number of digits and see if the counts make sense, but that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for the remaining 88 numbers. Let me recount.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but only up to 488. So, for the tens digit:\n\n- 0: 401-410:10 numbers\n- 1:411-420:10\n- 2:421-430:10\n- 3:431-440:10\n- 4:441-450:10\n- 5:451-460:10\n- 6:461-470:10\n- 7:471-480:10\n- 8:481-488:8 numbers\n\nSo, for the tens digit 4: 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n\nFor the tens digit 8:8 numbers, so 8 eights.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:40 +10=50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place:40 +8=48.\n\nSo, the difference in tens place is 2 more 4's.\n\nIn hundreds place, 89 more 4's.\n\nSo, total difference:89 +2=91.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when we add up the 4's and 8's, the difference is 188-97=91. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 488 is a three-digit number, but maybe I should consider leading zeros? No, page numbers don't have leading zeros, so 1 is just 1, not 001. So, the hundreds digit is only present when the page number is 100 or above.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 fours. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nLet me try that approach to cross-verify.\n\nCalculating number of 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+48=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, same result.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 fours. That's correct.\n\nAnother way: think about how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor any digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated by:\n\n- Divide the number by the position's base (10, 100, etc.), get the higher digits and the current digit.\n- Depending on the current digit, count how many times d appears.\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, I can think in terms of each digit place.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for digit counting.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nLet\u2019s denote n as 488.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's = floor(n / 10) + extra if the remainder is >=4.\n\nSimilarly for 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I did that correctly earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place = floor(n / 100) * 10 + extra based on the tens digit.\n\nWait, maybe I can use a more systematic approach.\n\nLet me try to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place using the standard digit counting method.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488 / 10) =48.\n\nEach group contributes 1 four.\n\nThen, the remainder is 488 %10=8.\n\nIf the remainder is >=4, we add 1 more four.\n\nSince 8 >=4, add 1.\n\nSo, total units fours:48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place:\n\nSame method.\n\nComplete groups:48.\n\nEach contributes 1 eight.\n\nRemainder:8, which is equal to 8, so add 1.\n\nTotal units eights:48 +1=49.\n\nSo, same as before.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place.\n\nEach complete group of 100 contributes 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete groups: floor(488 / 100)=4.\n\nSo, 4*10=40 fours.\n\nNow, the remainder is 488 %100=88.\n\nIn the tens place, the current digit is floor(88 /10)=8.\n\nIf current digit >4, add 10.\n\nIf current digit ==4, add (88 %10 +1).\n\nWait, no, perhaps a better way:\n\nThe number of fours in the tens place is calculated as:\n\nhigher = floor(n / 100) =4.\n\ncurrent = floor((n /10) %10)=8.\n\nlower = n %10=8.\n\nIf current >4: higher *10 +10.\n\nIf current ==4: higher *10 + (lower +1).\n\nIf current <4: higher *10.\n\nSince current=8>4, so number of fours in tens place:4*10 +10=50.\n\nWait, but wait, that doesn't seem right because 4*10=40, and since current>4, we add 10 more? But in reality, in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit goes up to 8, so the fours in tens place would be only 10 more, from 441-450. So, yes, 40 +10=50. So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nhigher=4.\n\ncurrent=8.\n\nlower=8.\n\nIf current >8: higher *10 +10.\n\nIf current ==8: higher *10 + (lower +1).\n\nSince current=8, so number of eights in tens place:4*10 + (8 +1)=40 +9=49? Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, discrepancy here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nFor tens digit=8, number of eights in tens place:\n\nhigher= floor(488 /100)=4.\n\ncurrent= floor((488 /10) %10)=8.\n\nlower=488 %10=8.\n\nIf current >8: higher*10 +10.\n\nIf current ==8: higher*10 + (lower +1).\n\nSo, current=8, so number of eights in tens place:4*10 + (8 +1)=40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I manually counted, I had 40 +8=48 eights in the tens place. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is wrong, or my manual counting was wrong.\n\nWait, let's think. From 1-488, in the tens place, how many eights are there?\n\nEach 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in 400 numbers, that's 4 times, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers (481-488). So, 8 eights.\n\nSo, total eights in tens place:40 +8=48.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 49. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the formula is considering 481-488 as 9 numbers, but it's actually 8 numbers:481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 8 numbers, so 8 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, the formula might be incorrect in this case because when current=8 and lower=8, it adds (lower +1)=9, which would be incorrect because the actual count is lower +1 if the lower digits go up to 9, but in this case, we only go up to 8.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is intended for numbers where the lower digits go up to 9. So, in our case, since we're stopping at 488, which is less than 490, the lower digits don't reach 9. So, perhaps the formula isn't directly applicable here.\n\nTherefore, I think my manual count is correct: 40 +8=48 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, why does the formula give 49? Because it assumes that the lower digits go up to 9, which they don't in this case. So, perhaps the formula needs adjustment when the number doesn't complete the full set of lower digits.\n\nTherefore, I'll stick with my manual count: 48 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:50, 8's:48.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nNumber of 8's:0, since the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nSo, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just check once more to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's:49, 8's:49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:50, 8's:48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89, 8's:0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. The book has 488 pages, so the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488). \n\nI think the key here is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the problem into parts. I'll consider each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial cycle if 488 isn't a multiple of 10. Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last cycle is incomplete.\n\nIn each full cycle of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does 8. So, for the units place, how many full cycles are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8. So, in the units place, the count is 48 full cycles (each contributing 1 four and 1 eight) plus 1 four and 1 eight in the partial cycle. So total for units place: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, 8's = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So the difference here is zero.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Each full cycle of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So for 48 full cycles, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in this partial cycle, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units place: 48 +1=49 for 4, and 48 +1=49 for 8. So same count, so no difference here.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, the digits cycle every 100 numbers. Each set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place for 80-89.\n\nSo, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, same for 8. So for 4 full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), let's look at the tens place. The tens digit here ranges from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nWait, let me think. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit appears 10 times, except possibly the last one if it's cut short.\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. So, starting at 401, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410 (10 numbers), then 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-488 (which is 8 numbers, since 488 is the end). So, for the tens digit:\n\n- 0 appears 10 times (401-410)\n- 1 appears 10 times (411-420)\n- 2 appears 10 times (421-430)\n- 3 appears 10 times (431-440)\n- 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- 5 appears 10 times (451-460)\n- 6 appears 10 times (461-470)\n- 7 appears 10 times (471-480)\n- 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. So in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). \n\nSo, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total for the tens place:\n\n4's: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the partial hundred, so total 50.\n\n8's: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 8 in the partial hundred, so total 48.\n\nSo in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times. So the difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's.\n\nHmm, that's a start. Now, let's move on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit represents a hundred numbers. So for 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (since they are two-digit numbers). From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299 it's 2; 300-399 it's 3; and 400-488 it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, because 800 is beyond 488. So the hundreds digit 8 never appears. So the count for 8 in the hundreds place is zero.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, now let's sum up the counts for each place.\n\nFirst, let me summarize:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4: 49\n- 8: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4: 50\n- 8: 48\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4: 89\n- 8: 0\n\nNow, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = let's calculate that.\n\n49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 97.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract 97 from 188: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nEach full cycle of 10 numbers contributes 1 four and 1 eight. There are 48 full cycles (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles). So 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, units place: 48 +1=49 fours, 48 +1=49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach full hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For tens digit 4, it's 10 times (441-450), and for 8, it's 8 times (481-488). So, tens place: 40 +10=50 fours, 40 +8=48 eights. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, which is 89 numbers, hundreds digit is 4. So 89 fours. No eights in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo total fours: 49 +50 +89= 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49 +48 +0= 97.\n\nDifference:188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but 91 seems high. Let me think if I'm counting correctly.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe I should calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different counting method to verify.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is given by:\n\nfloor((n + 1) / 10) + ((n + 1) mod 10 >= d + 1) ? 1 : 0.\n\nWait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, for each digit position, calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times. Similarly, tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 401-488, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, adding to the full hundreds, which is 4*10=40 each, so 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+8=48 for 8.\n\nUnits place: as before, 49 each.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the answer should be 91 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another way: perhaps using a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nStarting with units digit:\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nNumber of complete decades (groups of 10):48 (since 48*10=480). Each decade contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 fours and 48 eights.\n\nRemaining numbers:481-488 (8 numbers). In these, units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, total units:48+1=49 fours, 48+1=49 eights.\n\nTens digit:\n\nNumber of complete centuries (groups of 100):4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each century contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 fours, 4*10=40 eights.\n\nRemaining numbers:401-488 (88 numbers). The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). For each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each occur?\n\n- 0: 10 numbers (401-410)\n- 1:10 (411-420)\n- 2:10 (421-430)\n- 3:10 (431-440)\n- 4:10 (441-450)\n- 5:10 (451-460)\n- 6:10 (461-470)\n- 7:10 (471-480)\n- 8:8 numbers (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total tens place:40+10=50 fours, 40+8=48 eights.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4 or 8.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488 inclusive). Hundreds digit 8 never appears, as 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, hundreds place:89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n\nFours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nEights:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nSo, I think this is correct. Therefore, 91 more fours are printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, while the digit 8 appears 97 times. The difference is 91 more fours than eights.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI remember that for problems like this, it's helpful to break down the counting based on each digit position. So, I'll consider the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place one by one.\n\n1. **Units place for 4's:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n   - In each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48 complete sets.\n   - Each set contributes 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times.\n   - But wait, the last set might not be complete. From 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. Since 4 is within this range (484), that's an additional 1 occurrence.\n   - So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 4's:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - How many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? That's 4 (since 400 is the fourth hundred).\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40.\n   - But wait, the last hundred is from 400 to 488. The tens digit in this hundred is 4 only from 400-409, which is 10 numbers. But 400-409 is part of the 400s, so that's 10 occurrences. However, 400-488 includes 400-409 (10 numbers) and then 410-488, but the tens digit here is 1,2,...,8, so no more 4's in the tens place beyond 400-409. So, the 400s contribute exactly 10 occurrences.\n   - Therefore, total tens place 4's: 40 (from the first three hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299) plus 10 from 400-409. Wait, but 400-409 is part of the 400s, which is the fourth hundred. So, actually, each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40. But wait, the fourth hundred is only up to 488, so from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 occurrences, making the total 4*10=40? Wait, no, because 400-488 is the fourth hundred, but 400-488 is 88 numbers, so the tens digit cycles through 0-8, but the 4's in the tens place are only in 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, the tens place 4's are 10 in the fourth hundred, same as the others. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10=40.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, for 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, and 300-399, each contributes 10 occurrences, so that's 4*10=40. Then, for 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, because 400-488 is part of the 400s, and we've already counted 400-409 as part of the tens digit. Wait, but if we're considering each hundred, then 400-499 would be the next hundred, but since we only go up to 488, we have to adjust. So, perhaps the tens place 4's in 400-488 are only 10 (from 400-409), so total tens place 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50? But wait, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so maybe the 400s contribute only 10, making the total 40 (from the first three hundreds) plus 10 from the 400s, totaling 50. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 1 to 488.\n\nThe tens digit is 4 in the ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is beyond 488? No, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10 numbers. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences, so that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, the tens place 4's are 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the first three hundreds contribute 4*10=40, but now I'm seeing that it's actually 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50. So, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me recount.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nThat's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times that the tens digit is 4.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 400-409 is part of the 400s, but now I'm considering 440-449 as another set. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nEach hundred has a set where the tens digit is 4. So, 0-99: 40-49, 100-199:140-149, 200-299:240-249, 300-399:340-349, and 400-488:440-449. So, that's five sets, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nOkay, so units place 4's: 49, tens place 4's:50, and now hundreds place 4's.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 4's:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488.\n   - So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the 400-488 range, which is 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds: 49+50=99; 99+89=188. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nNow, let's check the 8's.\n\nI need to count how many times 8 appears in each digit place.\n\n1. **Units place for 8's:**\n   - Similar to 4's, each set of 10 numbers has exactly one 8 in the units place.\n   - Number of complete sets of 10 in 488: 48 complete sets (since 488 /10=48.8).\n   - Each set contributes 1 occurrence, so 48.\n   - Now, the last partial set is 481-488, which has units digits 1-8. So, 8 is present once (488).\n   - So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 8's:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in the ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40.\n   - The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the tens digit is 8 here, contributing 9 occurrences.\n   - So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 8's:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Last set: 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 8 is present once (488). So, 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10=40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in the tens place would be 49, but let me check again.\n\nWait, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nWait, 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nAnd 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 4's. Earlier, I thought it was 50, but let me check again.\n\nTens place for 4's: ranges where tens digit is 4 are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.\n\nEach of these ranges contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges *10=50.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, we have 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, the counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nUnits place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- For 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if the remainder is >=4. 488%10=8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49.\n- For 8's: same logic, floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if remainder >=8. 488%10=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, check the last partial hundred: 488%100=88. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is within 0-88, so add 10. So total tens 4's:4*10 +10=50.\n- For 8's: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, check the last partial hundred:488%100=88. The tens digit is 8 in 80-88, which is 9 numbers, so add 9. So total tens 8's:4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since 488 >=400, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n- For 8's: floor(488/1000)=0, and 488 <800, so no 8's in hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 '4'.\n     - Total complete blocks: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n     - Partial block (481-488): 1 '4' (at 484).\n     - Total units '4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each block of 100 numbers has 10 '4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n     - Total complete hundreds: 4 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399).\n     - Each contributes 10, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - Partial hundred (400-488): 10 '4's (400-409).\n     - Total tens '4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - From 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a '4' in the hundreds place.\n     - Total hundreds '4's: 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Similar to '4's, each block of 10 contributes 1 '8'.\n     - Total units '8's: 48 (complete blocks) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each block of 100 has 10 '8's (e.g., 80-89).\n     - Complete hundreds: 4, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - Partial hundred (400-488): 9 '8's (480-488).\n     - Total tens '8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n     - Total hundreds '8's: 0.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about this step by step. I should probably count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8, and then subtract the two counts to find the difference. \n\nFirst, I should clarify whether I'm counting the digit 4 and 8 in all positions, like units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, for example, in page 4, the digit 4 is in the units place, and in page 48, it's in the tens place. Similarly for 8's. So, I need to consider each digit position separately.\n\nLet me break it down by each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The tens digit can be 0 through 9, and the units digit can be 0 through 9 as well.\n\nI think the best way is to calculate the number of times 4 appears in each position and then do the same for 8, and then subtract.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each full set of 10 pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many full sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, and then in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: in each set of 10, 8 appears once. So, same as above, 48 full sets, so 48 times, and in the extra 8 pages, 8 appears once (page 488). So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit of 488 is 8, so yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for example, in 1-100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89).\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many hundreds are there? From 1-488, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Let's see: 440-449 would be the tens digit 4, so that's 10 pages. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the tens digit in 401-488 goes up to 8, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, right? So that's another 10 times. So total 4's in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 includes 400-488, so 400 is included. So, from 400 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 440-449 is within that, so yes, 10 times. So total 4's in tens place: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: each hundred has 10 occurrences (80-89), so 4*10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so 80-89 would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred. So total 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the pages would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So yes, 9 times. So total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Only in the pages from 400-488. So, that's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place: well, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4 in this book, since it's 488 pages. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nWait, but wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is correct, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nWait, 48+50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times.\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, 49+49 is 98, yes.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check each step again.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFor 4: Each 10 pages, 4 appears once. 488/10=48.8, so 48 times, and in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so no additional 4's. So 48.\n\nFor 8: Each 10 pages, 8 appears once, so 48 times, plus in the last 8 pages, 488 has units digit 8, so total 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4: Each hundred has 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so total 50.\n\nFor 8: Each hundred has 10 times, so 4*10=40. In 401-488, tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nFor 8: 0 times.\n\nSo total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each 10 pages contribute one 4. There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, plus 8 extra pages without another 4. Total: 48.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, 48 full sets plus one in 488. Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred has 10 occurrences. 4 hundreds contribute 40, plus 10 in 440-449. Total: 50.\n   - **8's:** 4 hundreds contribute 40, plus 9 in 480-488. Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** 400-488 (89 pages). Total: 89.\n   - **8's:** No occurrence. Total: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step. Maybe I should start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the first page is 1, and the last is 488. I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8, and then find the difference between those two counts.\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach this by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Because the number of times a digit appears in each place can be calculated separately and then summed up.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, every digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Then from 11 to 20, it's 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 again, and so on.\n\nWait, but in this case, the book has 488 pages, so the last page is 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I need to consider up to three digits. Let me think about each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. In every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; in 21-30, it's 24, and so on. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 complete blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484. So that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check that again. Because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial block, which is 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place. So, yes, that's one more. So total 4's in units place: 49.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the units place. Similarly, in every block of 10, the units digit 8 appears once. So, 48 complete blocks would give 48 eights in the units place. Now, in the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits are 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's the same as 4's in the units place. So, so far, in units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the count is equal in the units place. So, the difference so far is zero.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. For the tens digit, the same idea applies but in blocks of 100. Because the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per 100 numbers.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the tens place, each block of 100 contributes 10 instances. Similarly for 8.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488.\n\nSo, in each of the 4 complete blocks, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 blocks * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the 400s, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), up to 8 (481-490). Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, but only up to 488. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place in this partial block?\n\nFrom 480-489, the tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, but 480 is actually in the 400s, but wait, 480 would be page 480, which is within 401-488. Wait, but 480 is 480, which is within 401-488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 is included in the 401-488 range, so yes, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 instances of 8 in the tens place in the partial block. But wait, 480 is included, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n401-410: tens digit 0\n411-420: tens digit 1\n...\n481-490: tens digit 8\n\nBut since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, right? Wait, 481 to 488 is 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 8 numbers, not 9. So, the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, that's 8 instances of 8 in the tens place in the partial block.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480 is included, but 480 is actually page 480, which would be in the previous block, 401-488. Wait, no, 480 is within 401-488, right? So, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in the partial block, 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 instances of 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480 is page 480, which is included in 401-488. So, in that case, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers: 480-488.\n\nSo, for 8's in the tens place, in the partial block, it's 9 instances.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the partial block, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 instances of 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 49.\n\nNow, what about 4's in the tens place? Let's do the same.\n\nIn each complete block of 100, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 blocks * 10 = 40 times.\n\nIn the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit 4 would appear in the 440s, right? So, from 440-449, the tens digit is 4. But wait, in our case, the partial block is up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, right? So, that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 more instances.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 instances of 4 in the tens place in the partial block.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 (from partial block) = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on. The partial block is 401-488, so 440-449 is within that, so yes, 10 numbers with tens digit 4.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 50\n8's in tens place: 49\n\nSo, the difference in tens place is 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it only changes every 100 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digits go from 0 (for 1-99), then 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear at all. So, number of 8's in hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nSo, the difference in hundreds place is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place for 4's: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 in the last partial block, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's: same as 4's, 49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in the partial block, 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. Total 50. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in the partial block, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: 0, since 800 is beyond 488. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any chance I overcounted in the hundreds place? Because 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. Similarly, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nHmm, seems like the math adds up. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the total number of digits printed and see if the counts make sense. But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can recount the 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nWait, another approach: for each digit place, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of times each digit appears in units place: floor(488/10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each, plus in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), check if 4 and 8 appear.\n\nIn 481-488, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach block of 100 contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 100: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n\nEach contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, in the partial block 401-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nFor 4: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFor 8: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total for 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal for 8 in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor 8: none, since 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - Remaining numbers: 481-488 (8 numbers).\n   - 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Count 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 instances of each digit in the tens place.\n   - Complete blocks of 100: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n   - Each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - Partial block (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Count 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488: 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's. So, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm going to think out loud here, so I might make some mistakes, but I'll correct them as I go.\n\nFirst, I know that each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and each of these numbers is printed once. So, the task is to count how many times the digit '4' appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit '8' appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nHmm, so maybe I should start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. That way, I can calculate how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers, right? So, for example, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nWait, but actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, the number of times a specific digit, say '4', appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete blocks of 10 in 488, plus any extra numbers beyond that.\n\nBut wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). So, in each complete block, '4' appears once in the units place. So, 48 times from the complete blocks, plus in the extra 8 numbers, does '4' appear in the units place? Let's see: 481, 482, ..., 488. The units digits are 1 through 8, so '4' does appear once in the units place here as well. So total for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 times for '4'.\n\nSimilarly, for '8' in the units place: in each block of 10, '8' appears once, so 48 times from the complete blocks. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so '8' appears once more. So total for '8' in units place is 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nSo, in the units place, both '4' and '8' appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, okay.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is '0' for 1-9, '1' for 11-19, ..., '9' for 91-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per 100 numbers.\n\nSo, for '4' in the tens place: in each 100-number block, '4' appears 10 times. How many complete 100-number blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each of the 4 complete blocks, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial block from 401-488, how many times does '4' appear in the tens place? Well, the tens digit is '4' for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. So, the tens digit '4' occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more times. So total for '4' in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers, but the tens digit cycles every 10. So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from '0' (401-410) to '8' (480-488). So, the tens digit '4' occurs in 440-449, which is indeed 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for '8' in the tens place: in each 100-number block, '8' appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 complete blocks give 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit '8' occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, but actually, in the tens place, 480-489 is when the tens digit is '8', so from 480 to 489, but since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit '8' appears 9 times here. So, total for '8' in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit '8' occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total '8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, for the tens place, '4' appears 50 times, and '8' appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more '4' than '8' in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit cycles every 1000 numbers, but since our book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be '0' (for 1-99), '1' (100-199), '2' (200-299), '3' (300-399), and '4' (400-488).\n\nSo, for '4' in the hundreds place: it appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has '4' in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nFor '8' in the hundreds place: well, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit is '0' for 1-99, '1' for 100-199, '2' for 200-299, '3' for 300-399, and '4' for 400-488. There's no page number where the hundreds digit is '8' because 800-899 would be beyond 488. So, '8' appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total '4's in hundreds place: 89 times, and '8's: 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more '4's than '8's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but hold on, is that correct? Because 400-488 is 89 numbers, so each has '4' in the hundreds place, yes. So, 89 '4's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFirst, for '4's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\n\nTotal '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor '8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\n\nTotal '8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (number of '4's) minus 98 (number of '8's) equals 90.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, let me go back and check each digit place again.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor '4's: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 '4' in units place, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so '4' appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor '8's: same logic, 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 '8' in units place, so 48. Then, in the last partial block, units digits go up to 8, so '8' appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor '4's: 4 complete blocks of 100, each contributing 10 '4's in tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit '4' occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nFor '8's: 4 complete blocks, 4*10=40. In the last partial block, the tens digit '8' occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor '4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a '4' in hundreds place. So, 89. Correct.\n\nFor '8's: no numbers in 1-488 have '8' in hundreds place. So, 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but that seems correct? Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe I can calculate the total number of '4's and '8's separately, then subtract.\n\nWait, but I think I did that already. So, 188 '4's and 98 '8's, so 90 more '4's than '8's.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me check with a smaller number to see if my method is correct.\n\nFor example, let's take a 20-page book. How many '1's and '2's would there be?\n\nPage numbers 1-20.\n\nCounting '1's:\n\nUnits place: 1,11,21 (but wait, 21 is beyond 20, so only 1 and 11. So, 2 times.\n\nTens place: 10-19, which is 10 numbers, each with '1' in tens place, so 10 times.\n\nTotal '1's: 2 + 10 = 12.\n\n'2's:\n\nUnits place: 2,12,22 (22 is beyond 20, so only 2 and 12. So, 2 times.\n\nTens place: 20, which is one number, so '2' appears once.\n\nTotal '2's: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nDifference: 12 - 3 = 9. So, 9 more '1's than '2's.\n\nWait, let me count manually:\n\nPages 1-20:\n\nNumbers: 1,2,3,...,20.\n\n'1's: 1,10-19 (each has '1' in tens place), and 11 has two '1's. Wait, but in my earlier method, I didn't count the number of digits, just the occurrence. So, in 10-19, each number has '1' in tens place once, so 10 times. Plus '1' in units place once. So, total '1's: 10 + 1 = 11.\n\nWait, but 11 has two '1's, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial method doesn't account for numbers where the digit appears more than once. Hmm, so maybe I need to adjust my approach.\n\nWait, in the problem, each page is printed once, so each page number is a single number, but digits can repeat within a number. So, for example, page 11 has two '1's, so each '1' in each digit place is counted separately.\n\nWait, so in my initial method, when I counted '1's in units and tens places separately, I was correct because each occurrence is counted, even if it's in the same number.\n\nSo, in the 20-page example, '1's in units place: 1,11 \u2192 2 times.\n\n'1's in tens place: 10-19 \u2192 10 times.\n\nTotal '1's: 12.\n\nBut in reality, page 11 has two '1's, so total '1's should be 12, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, '2's in units place: 2,12 \u2192 2 times.\n\n'2's in tens place: 20 \u2192 1 time.\n\nTotal '2's: 3 times.\n\nSo, difference is 12 - 3 = 9, which is correct.\n\nSo, my method works for this small example, so perhaps it's correct for the 488-page book as well.\n\nTherefore, going back, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more '4's than '8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again because 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 '4's in hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way: total number of '4's is 188, '8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a large number, but maybe that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the total number of digits and see if 188 '4's and 98 '8's make sense.\n\nTotal number of digits from 1 to 488:\n\nNumbers 1-9: 1 digit each, 9 numbers \u2192 9 digits.\n\nNumbers 10-99: 2 digits each, 90 numbers \u2192 180 digits.\n\nNumbers 100-488: 3 digits each, 389 numbers \u2192 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, if '4's appear 188 times and '8's 98 times, that's 286 digits. So, 286 out of 1356 digits are either '4's or '8's, which seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of '4's and '8's in each digit place again to confirm.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor '4's: 48 full decades (each contributing 1 '4'), plus 1 in the last partial decade (481-488). So, 49.\n\nFor '8's: same, 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor '4's: 4 full centuries (each contributing 10 '4's in tens place), plus 10 in the last partial century (440-449). So, 50.\n\nFor '8's: 4 full centuries, 40, plus 9 in the last partial century (480-488). So, 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor '4's: 89 (400-488).\n\nFor '8's: 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n'4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n'8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more '4's than '8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider another approach. Maybe using a formula for digit occurrences.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N is a bit involved, but perhaps I can apply it here.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, calculate the number of times '4' and '8' appear.\n\nWait, I think I've already done that, so perhaps 90 is the correct answer.\n\nSo, final answer: 90 more '4's than '8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count '4's and '8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Number of complete blocks of 10 in 488: 48.\n   - '4' appears once in each block, totaling 48, plus once in the last partial block (481-488), totaling 49.\n   - Similarly, '8' appears 49 times.\n\n2. **Count '4's and '8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Number of complete blocks of 100 in 488: 4.\n   - '4' appears 10 times per block, totaling 40, plus 10 times in the last partial block (440-449), totaling 50.\n   - '8' appears 10 times per block, totaling 40, plus 9 times in the last partial block (480-488), totaling 49.\n\n3. **Count '4's and '8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step. Maybe I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nFirst, I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, and maybe even thousands, although since the book only has 488 pages, the thousands place would only be relevant if the page numbers went into the thousands, which they don't here. So, I can ignore the thousands place.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's in each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, pages 4, 14, 24, etc. Since the book has 488 pages, the number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place. But wait, that's not quite right because the last block is only 8 pages (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times because each full block of 10 contributes one 4, and the incomplete block doesn't include a 4 in the units place (since 484 would be the last 4 in the units place, but 484 is within the 480-488 range). Wait, actually, 484 is within 480-488, so maybe the units digit 4 appears 49 times? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, let me think again. The total number of pages is 488, so the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48 times for each digit, but then we have 8 extra pages (481-488). So, for the units digit, digits 1 through 8 appear once more, and digits 9 and 0 don't. So, the digit 4 appears 48 times in the units place, plus one more time in the extra 8 pages (page 484). So, total 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, no, because 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the units digit 4 appears 48 times plus one more if the remainder includes 4. The remainder is 8 pages: 481-488. So, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in this last partial block, the units digit is 4 only once (484). So, total units digit 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Now, the book has 488 pages, so how many complete hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, the last partial hundred is 401-488, which is 88 pages. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's another 10 4's. So, total tens digit 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's correct. So, total 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the pages 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, which is 89 times. So, hundreds digit 4's: 89.\n\nWait, but 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the 4's in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, each block of 10 pages has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and then the last 8 pages (481-488) have one more 8 in the units place (page 488). So, units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, the last partial hundred is 401-488, which includes 480-488. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, meaning 9 occurrences. So, total tens digit 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, which is correct. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, hundreds digit 8's: 0.\n\nNow, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49. Correct because 48 full blocks (48*1) and one more in the last 8 pages (484). So, 49.\n- Tens place: 50. Because 4 full hundreds (4*10=40) and in the last partial hundred, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 more. Total 50.\n- Hundreds place: 89. Because 400-488 is 89 pages. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49. 48 full blocks, plus 488, so 49.\n- Tens place: 49. 4 full hundreds (4*10=40) and in the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more. Total 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place, for 8's: each hundred has 10 pages where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, for 488 pages, how many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1-400: 400 pages. So, 4 blocks of 100. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 401-488: 88 pages. In this range, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 8's total is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n4's total is 188.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 4's in the hundreds place are 89, which is a lot. Let me make sure that's correct.\n\nFrom page 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0. Correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: The total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4.\n   - 488 pages mean 48 full blocks (48*1) and an extra 8 pages (481-488), which includes one more 4 (page 484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's (e.g., 40-49).\n   - 488 pages mean 4 full hundreds (4*10=40) and the last 88 pages include 440-449 (10 more 4's).\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 as the hundreds digit.\n   - Total pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 8.\n   - 488 pages mean 48 full blocks (48*1) and an extra 8 pages (481-488), which includes one more 8 (page 488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 8's (e.g., 80-89).\n   - 488 pages mean 4 full hundreds (4*10=40) and the last 88 pages include 480-488 (9 more 8's).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 800-899 would have 8 as the hundreds digit, but the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and each number is printed once. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me break it down by the positions of the digits: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears once in the units place (like 8, 18, 28, etc.).\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). So, in each of the 48 complete blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, totaling 48 times. The digit 8 also appears 48 times in the units place from the complete blocks. Now, checking the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 8 appears once in the units place (page 488), and the digit 4 doesn't appear in the units place here because 484 would be in the 480-489 block, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within 481-488. Wait, no, 481-488 includes 484, so the units digit 4 appears once here as well. Hmm, wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, 481 to 488 is 8 pages: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So in the units place, the digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (page 488). Therefore, for the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from the partial block) = 49. Similarly, the total number of 8's in the units place is 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from the partial block) = 49.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because earlier I thought 488 is the last page, so maybe I need to check if 484 is included. Since 484 is less than 488, it's included. So, yes, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place in the partial block. So, units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, etc., up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (80-89).\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Now, in this partial hundred, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from the partial hundred) = 50. The total number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from the partial hundred) = 49.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm counting correctly. Let me think again. In the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For the tens digit 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, yes, 10 and 9 respectively.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total in hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, earlier, in the units place, I had 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight, so 48 each, then the partial block from 481-488 adds 1 four (484) and 1 eight (488), so units place: 49 fours and 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each complete hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights. There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), fours in the tens place: 440-449 is 10 fours. Eights in the tens place: 480-488 is 9 eights. So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, and 40 + 9 = 49 eights. That adds up.\n\nIn the hundreds place, fours appear 89 times (400-488), and eights never appear there. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistake in counting the units place for the partial block. The partial block is 481-488, which is 8 pages. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, the partial hundred is 401-488. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, 4 in the tens place is from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours. 8 in the tens place is from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 fours, and no eights.\n\nSo, adding up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.\n\nAnd for eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that in the hundreds place, the count is off? Because 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits printed. Each page number from 1 to 488. Pages 1-9: 1 digit each, so 9 pages, 9 digits.\n\nPages 10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each, so 180 digits.\n\nPages 100-488: 389 pages, 3 digits each, so 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, 188 + 98 = 286. But 286 is much less than 1356, so that's fine.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if I counted correctly in each digit place.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: For each block of 10, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete blocks (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 times. Plus, in the last partial block (481-488), 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears once per block of 10, so 48 times, plus once in the last partial block (488), so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor each block of 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49 in each hundred). There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place in each complete hundred (80-89 in each hundred), so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the partial hundred, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nBut let me check once more for any possible mistake.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 4's? Well, every 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once at 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 488, which is an extra 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's: Each hundred has 10 pages with 4 in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 is another 10, so 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: Each hundred has 10 pages with 8 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89. 8's: 0.\n\nSo, yes, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's printed is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step. I think I should start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), or three-digit (100-488). I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, which gives 48*1 = 48 fours. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so there's no 4 in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488). In each of the 4 full blocks, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4*10 = 40 fours. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 0-8. Wait, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in this partial block, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers, so starting from 401, the tens digits go 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). So, in this partial block, the tens digit is 4 for 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8 full tens blocks (each of 10 numbers) and 8 extra numbers. But in this case, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, so the 4 in the tens place occurs exactly once in this partial block, right? So, 441-450 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 10 fours. So, total tens place 4's are 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. As before, in each block of 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 eight, so 48*1 = 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once in the units place (488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many full blocks of 100 are there in 488? 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10 = 40. Now, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we're stopping at 488, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many eights? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights are 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digits go 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me add that up again: units is 49, tens is 49, so 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units was 49, tens 49, so 98. But wait, let me double-check the units place. So, units place: 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1 eight, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49, correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 + 9 = 49, correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since we don't reach 800. So, total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated 4's, I got 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's go back to the 4's calculation. Units place: 48, correct. Tens place: 50, correct. Hundreds place: 89, correct. So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187, correct.\n\nFor 8's: Units place: 49, correct. Tens place: 49, correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, 49 more 4's than 8's. Wait, no, 187 - 98 is 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss something.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, in each 100, 10 times, so 4*10 = 40, plus in the last partial 100 (401-488), 10 more, so 50, correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, and the last 8 numbers don't add any, so 48, correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, and the last 8 numbers contribute 1 more (488), so 49.\n\nTens place for 8's: 4 full blocks, each contributing 10, so 40, and in the last partial block, 9 more, so 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but 187 - 98 is 89, correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, so 4 in the tens place occurs once every 100 numbers, but in this case, in the partial 100, it's 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct. So, that's 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the 8's again. For the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 (from full blocks) + 9 = 49.\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks, 48 eights, plus 488, so 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 4's: 187, 8's:98, difference: 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 8's would contribute, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by considering each digit place separately and counting the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor 4's in units place: As before, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total number of times 4 appears in units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48 times, plus if the last partial block (481-488) has a 4, but since 481-488 ends at 8, no 4 in units place, so 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if the last number is 488, which has an 8 in units place, so 48 +1=49.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nFor 4's in tens place: Every 100 numbers, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, total number of times 4 appears in tens place is floor(488 / 100) * 10 = 4*10=40. Plus, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: floor(488 / 100)=4, so 4*10=40. Plus, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 +9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFor 4's in hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nFor 8's in hundreds place: Since 488 < 800, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, so I think that's correct. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all the ranges correctly.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place, it's from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, in the range 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, in 401-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, correct.\n\nUnits place seems correct as well.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the difference is 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step. I think I'll approach this by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the numbers range from single digits (1-9) to three digits (100-488).\n\nI think the best way to count the number of times a digit appears is to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each place for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet's first count the number of 4's.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on.\n\nNow, how many such sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers, I need to check if there's a 4 in the units place. The numbers are 481-488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. There's no 4 in the units place here, so that's 0. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, a 4 will appear in a block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49 have 4 in the tens place for all ten numbers. Each such block contributes 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nHow many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see. The first block is 40-49, which is one block. Then, the next would be 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's five blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's, so that's 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, is there any other block beyond these? The next would be 540-549, but 540 is beyond 488, so we don't count that. So, total 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up the 4's in each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total number of 4's is 187.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in each block of ten, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears once every ten numbers. So, how many full blocks of ten are there in 488? As before, 48 full blocks and 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each full block, 8 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last block. Each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many full blocks there are.\n\nFirst block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's in tens place.\n\nSecond block: 180-189: another 10.\n\nThird block: 280-289: another 10.\n\nFourth block: 380-389: another 10.\n\nFifth block: 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, this block is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, each of these numbers has an 8, so that's 9 8's.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (40) plus 9 from the partial block, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The first four blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. The fifth block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 9. So total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check the tens place. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 8 appears once in 488, so total 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, so the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, how many more 4's than 8's? That would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a big difference. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 times. Tens place: 5 blocks of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 89 times. So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks, 48, plus 1 in the last partial block, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each 10, so 40, plus 9 in 480-488, so 49.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nWait, another way to think about the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488, so 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 4's, we had five blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That seems right.\n\nFor the units place, 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, and the last partial block didn't have a 4, so 48.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 full blocks, 48, and the last partial block had 488, which is an 8, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) contributing 40, plus 9 in 480-488, so 49.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nTherefore, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. The fifth block is 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so 9 8's. So, 4 blocks of 10 (40) plus 9, total 49. That's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98, so there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't count any overlaps or miss any numbers. Maybe I should try a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a 3-digit number, we can break it down into hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\nUnits place: For each digit from 0-9, each digit appears equally in the units place. So, up to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 48 complete groups (480 numbers), each contributing one 4. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) don't have a 4 in the units place. So, 48 4's in units.\n\nTens place: For each ten's digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nIn the first 100 numbers (1-100), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49.\n\nSimilarly, in 101-200, 140-149: another 10.\n\n201-300: 240-249: another 10.\n\n301-400: 340-349: another 10.\n\n401-488: 440-449: another 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was five blocks, but in this approach, it's 5 blocks as well, so 50.\n\nWait, but when I did the previous approach, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, which is five blocks, each 10, so 50. That's consistent.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nSame as before.\n\nNow, for 8's.\n\nUnits place: Each block of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, up to 488, we have 48 complete blocks (480 numbers), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more, totaling 49.\n\nTens place: Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last block if it's incomplete.\n\nSo, in 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers.\n\n101-200: 180-189: 10.\n\n201-300: 280-289:10.\n\n301-400: 380-389:10.\n\n401-488: 480-488: 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, so 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nI think this confirms that the number of 4's is 89 more than the number of 8's. So, the answer should be 89.\n\nWait, but let me just think again if I missed anything. For example, in the units place for 4's, I considered 48 full blocks and none in the last partial block. For 8's, I had 48 full blocks and one in the last partial block. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, I had five blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. For 8's, I had four full blocks and one partial block contributing 9, so 49.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's contributed 89, while 8's contributed 0.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the total 4's are 187, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 89.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 '4'.\n     - Total blocks = 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n     - '4's in units place = 48.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each block of 100 numbers has 10 '4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n     - Number of such blocks up to 488: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - '4's in tens place = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - Numbers from 400 to 488 have '4' in the hundreds place.\n     - Count = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - '4's in hundreds place = 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each block of 10 contributes 1 '8'.\n     - Total blocks = 48, contributing 48 '8's.\n     - In the last partial block (481-488), '8' appears once (488).\n     - '8's in units place = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each block of 100 has 10 '8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n     - Full blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - Partial block (480-488) contributes 9 '8's.\n     - '8's in tens place = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - No numbers from 800-899 are present.\n     - '8's in hundreds place = 0.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how digits are counted in page numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I should consider all three cases: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nI think the best approach is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately and then sum them up.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place first.\n\n**Units Place:**\n\nFor the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. In each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place.\n\nSo, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Let's divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488).\n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for 48 sets, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's.\n\nNow, let's look at the extra 8 numbers: 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these, the units place gives us 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, but actually, from 1 to 488, the units digits go up to 8 in the last partial set. So, let me make sure I'm calculating this correctly.\n\nWait, no, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full tens and 8 extra numbers. So, the units digits in those 8 numbers (481 to 488) would be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, the total for units place is 48 fours and 48 eights from the full tens, plus 1 four and 1 eight from the partial set. So, total units place: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, units place contributes equally to both 4's and 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n\nIn the tens place, each digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nNow, let's look at the partial hundred: 401-488. The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear?\n\nWait, the tens digit in 401-488 is from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except for the last one, which might be less if the range doesn't complete the full 10 numbers.\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let's see: 401-410 is 10 numbers, 411-420 is another 10, and so on until 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. 480 is the start, so 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit for 480-488 is 8, but only 9 times because it's from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, for each group of 10, the tens digit is the same. So, from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; ...; 471-480, tens digit is 7; and 481-490 would have tens digit 8, but since we're only going up to 488, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers.\n\nWait, no, 481-490 is 10 numbers, but we're only going up to 488, so 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting with earlier thought. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let's break it down:\n\n- 401-410: 10 numbers, tens digit 0\n- 411-420: 10 numbers, tens digit 1\n- 421-430: 10 numbers, tens digit 2\n- 431-440: 10 numbers, tens digit 3\n- 441-450: 10 numbers, tens digit 4\n- 451-460: 10 numbers, tens digit 5\n- 461-470: 10 numbers, tens digit 6\n- 471-480: 10 numbers, tens digit 7\n- 481-490: 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, so in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488.\n\nSo, for the tens place in the partial hundred:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times\n- 8 appears 8 times\n\nTherefore, in the tens place overall:\n\n- From the 4 complete hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40 fours, 4 * 10 = 40 eights\n- From the partial hundred: 10 fours, 8 eights\n- Total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 8 = 48 eights\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, we have 50 fours and 48 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digits change every 100 numbers. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (but page numbers start at 1, so 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit printed). From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does each hundreds digit appear?\n\n- 1 appears 100 times (100-199)\n- 2 appears 100 times (200-299)\n- 3 appears 100 times (300-399)\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n\nWait, let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 appears 0 times because 800-899 would be needed, but the book only goes up to 488.\n\nSo, hundreds place contributes 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\n**Summing Up:**\n\n- **Units Place:**\n  - 4's: 49\n  - 8's: 49\n\n- **Tens Place:**\n  - 4's: 50\n  - 8's: 48\n\n- **Hundreds Place:**\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n\nNow, total number of 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's = 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nWait, so total 4's: 188, total 8's: 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 488 pages, so 48 full tens and 8 extra numbers.\n- Each full ten contributes 1 four and 1 eight in units place. So, 48 fours and 48 eights.\n- In the extra 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-400) and 88 extra pages (401-488).\n- In each full hundred, tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, 10 fours and 10 eights per hundred.\n- 4 full hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40 fours, 4 * 10 = 40 eights.\n- In the partial hundred (401-488):\n  - Tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488).\n  - For each tens digit, how many times do they appear?\n    - 0: 10 times (401-410)\n    - 1: 10 times (411-420)\n    - 2: 10 times (421-430)\n    - 3: 10 times (431-440)\n    - 4: 10 times (441-450)\n    - 5: 10 times (451-460)\n    - 6: 10 times (461-470)\n    - 7: 10 times (471-480)\n    - 8: 8 times (481-488)\n  - So, in the tens place for 401-488:\n    - 4 appears 10 times\n    - 8 appears 8 times\n- So, total tens place:\n  - 40 + 10 = 50 fours\n  - 40 + 8 = 48 eights\nThat seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 numbers, so hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n- 8's in hundreds place: 0 times, since the book doesn't go up to 800.\n- So, hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for the partial hundred?\n\nIn the partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers: 481-488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. That seems correct.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 50 fours and 48 eights.\n\nUnits place: 49 each.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all the digits correctly, especially in the hundreds place. Wait, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0, but since page numbers start at 1, those pages don't have a hundreds digit printed. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is not present, so no 4's or 8's in the hundreds place there.\n\nFrom 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's there.\n\nFrom 200-299, hundreds digit is 2, same thing.\n\nFrom 300-399, hundreds digit is 3, same.\n\nFrom 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 times.\n\nSo, yes, hundreds place contributes 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nSo, adding up, 188 fours and 97 eights, difference of 91.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place in the partial set. Wait, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place for 481-488: 1 four and 1 eight. So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, same for eights. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 401-488, as I thought earlier, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n### Units Place\n- Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n- There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 fours and 48 eights.\n- The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) contribute 1 four (484) and 1 eight (488).\n- Total in units place: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\n### Tens Place\n- Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n- There are 4 complete hundreds in 488, contributing 40 fours and 40 eights.\n- The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) contribute 10 fours (441-450) and 8 eights (481-488).\n- Total in tens place: 50 fours and 48 eights.\n\n### Hundreds Place\n- The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, appearing 89 times.\n- The hundreds digit is 8 for pages 800-899, which are not present in this book.\n- Total in hundreds place: 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\n### Summing Up\n- **Total fours**: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **Total eights**: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n### Difference\n- The difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}."

    "text": " Let me think step by step. So, each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and I have to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I think I should count the number of 4's in each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Similarly, I'll do the same for 8's. Then, add them up for each digit and find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, like 4, 14, 24, etc. Similarly, 8 appears once in each set of 10, like 8, 18, 28, etc.\n\nSo, for the units place, how many 4's are there? Well, the book has 488 pages, so there are 488 / 10 = 48 full sets of 10 pages, and then 8 extra pages. In each full set, there's one 4, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages, 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if I subtract, 49 - 49, the difference would be zero, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the last page is 488, so the extra pages after 480 are 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. So, units digits from 1 to 8. So, yes, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, units place for 4: 49, and for 8: 49. So, same.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, the 4's and 8's will appear in blocks of 100. Each hundred has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4, like 40-49, 140-149, etc., and similarly for 8's, like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nSo, first, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (40-49), so 10 times. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 times (80-89), so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Let's see: from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, in each set of 10, like 440-449, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. But wait, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 times. Therefore, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that's different. So, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's: 49. So, the difference here is 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, every page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times.\n\nHow about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, in 488 pages, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, and 3 in 300-399, etc. But 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check each part.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- 488 pages, so 48 full decades (48*10=480), and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n\nIn each decade, 4 appears once in units place, so 48 times. Then, in 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears once in each decade, so 48, plus once in 488, total 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Each hundred contributes 10 pages where tens digit is 4, so 4 hundreds give 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Each hundred contributes 10 pages where tens digit is 8, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last 88 pages, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89).\n\n- 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place in any page, since 488 < 800. So, 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, when I counted 4's in the last 88 pages, I considered 440-449 as 10 pages, but in 401-488, 440-449 is within that range, so yes, 10 pages. So, 10 more 4's in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 more 8's.\n\nSo, yeah, 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's in tens place.\n\nSo, the total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking how many more 4's than 8's, so 90 more 4's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, when counting the hundreds digit, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, 400 is included, so 400 is page 400, which is the first page in the hundreds place 4, and 488 is the last.\n\nSo, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 4's in hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, in the last 88 pages, 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, so 9 8's.\n\nWait, but when I did the tens place for 4's, I considered 440-449 as 10 pages, which is correct because 440 to 449 is 10 pages, all within 401-488.\n\nSo, 10 more 4's in tens place.\n\nSo, adding up, yes, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately, and sum them up.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus 1 if 488 >= 4 mod 10. Wait, 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus 1 if 488 >= 8 mod 10. 488 mod 10 is 8, so 48 +1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place: floor(488 / 100) = 4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the remaining pages: 488 - 4*100 = 88. So, in the remaining 88 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's the number of times the tens digit is 4 in 0-88. So, 44-49 is 6 numbers, but wait, in tens place, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. But since we're only going up to 88, 40-49 is within 0-88, so 10 times. So, total 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in tens place: floor(488 / 100)=4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Remaining pages:88. How many times does 8 appear in tens place? 80-88, which is 9 pages. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 1000)=0, but wait, 488 is less than 1000, but the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488. So, number of 4's in hundreds place is 488 - 400 +1=89.\n\nNumber of 8's in hundreds place: 0, since 488 < 800.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
