    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem clearly. Each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, so maybe I should start by considering how digits are arranged in page numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488, which means the highest number is a three-digit number, 488.\n\nI think I should consider each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. For each place, I can calculate how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears. Then, sum them up for all places to get the total counts.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. But since our page numbers start at 1, the first set is 1-10, where 0 doesn't appear in the units place, but 1-9 do. Wait, no, actually, 10 has a units digit of 0. Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of full cycles of 10.\n\nSo, for the units digit, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once as well (e.g., 8, 18, 28, etc.).\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 (from each group of 10) plus any additional in the partial group. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. In this group, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does the digit 4 appear once in this partial group? Yes, at 484. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once at 488. So, in the units place, total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and total 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so units place contributes equally to both digits, 49 each.\n\nWait, but let me check that. The first group is 1-10, which has 4 at 4 and 8 at 8. Then each subsequent group of 10 adds another 4 and 8 in the units place. So, 48 complete groups would give 48*1=48 for both 4 and 8. Then, the last group is 481-488, which includes 484 (units digit 4) and 488 (units digit 8). So, yes, 48 +1=49 for both. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each set of 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, ..., 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per 100 numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens digit, how many complete sets of 100 are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial set of 88 numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each complete set of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). So, for each of the 4 complete sets, that's 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights.\n\nNow, the partial set is 401-488. Let's look at the tens digit here. The tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, in this partial set, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. We need to find how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410 (10 numbers), 1 for 411-420 (10 numbers), 2 for 421-430 (10 numbers), 3 for 431-440 (10 numbers), 4 for 441-450 (10 numbers), 5 for 451-460 (10 numbers), 6 for 461-470 (10 numbers), 7 for 471-480 (10 numbers), and 8 for 481-488 (8 numbers).\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 numbers, right? So, the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the partial set, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (441-450), and the digit 8 appears for 8 numbers (481-488).\n\nSo, in the tens place, the number of 4's is 40 (from complete sets) + 10 (from partial set) = 50. The number of 8's is 40 (from complete sets) + 8 (from partial set) = 48.\n\nWait, let me make sure. So, in the partial set 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. And the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so that's 8 eights. So, yes, adding to the complete sets, we get 40+10=50 fours and 40+8=48 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it only starts appearing from page 100 onwards. So, in pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so we can ignore that since we're only counting digits 4 and 8. From page 100 onwards, the hundreds digit cycles every 1000 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWait, 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit goes from 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488).\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, which means 89 fours.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 800-899, the hundreds digit is 8, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with hundreds digit 8. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nWait, that seems correct because 488 is less than 800, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nFor the 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor the 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 fours and 49 eights. In the tens place, 50 fours and 48 eights. In the hundreds place, 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts for each place, especially the tens and hundreds places, to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nEach complete group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete groups (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups), so 48*1=48 for both 4 and 8. Then, the last partial group is 481-488, which has 8 pages. The units digits in this group are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48+1=49 fours, 48+1=49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete set of 100 pages contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. There are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights.\n\nNow, the partial set is 401-488, which is 88 pages. The tens digits in this range go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFor 4 in the tens place: It occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: It occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 eights.\n\nSo, adding to the complete sets: 40+10=50 fours, 40+8=48 eights. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99, hundreds digit is 0, so no contribution. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4.\n\nFor 4's: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, contributing 89 fours.\n\nFor 8's: Since 800-899 is beyond 488, there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8, so 0 eights.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97.\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately, and then sum them up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a systematic approach.\n\nLet me try to formalize the counting.\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of complete cycles of 10 in 488 pages: floor(488/10)=48 cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. The remaining pages: 488 mod 10=8 pages. In these 8 pages, units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So, total units place: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of complete cycles of 100 in 488 pages: floor(488/100)=4 cycles, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights. The remaining pages: 488 mod 100=88 pages.\n\nIn the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nFor the tens digit in 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410 (10 numbers)\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420 (10 numbers)\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430 (10 numbers)\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440 (10 numbers)\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450 (10 numbers)\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460 (10 numbers)\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470 (10 numbers)\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480 (10 numbers)\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears in 441-450: 10 times\n- 8 appears in 481-488: 8 times\n\nSo, total tens place: 4*10=40 +10=50 fours, and 4*10=40 +8=48 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of complete cycles of 1000: but since we only have 488 pages, the hundreds digit cycles as follows:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit 0 (no contribution)\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit 1 (no 4 or 8)\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit 2 (no 4 or 8)\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit 3 (no 4 or 8)\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit 4 (so 488-400+1=89 pages, so 89 fours)\n- Pages 500-...: beyond 488, so no contribution.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all possible cases correctly, especially in the tens and hundreds places.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is to count for each digit place separately, using the formula for digit frequency.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's = floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1 else 0). Wait, actually, the formula is a bit more involved.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the standard method for counting digit occurrences.\n\nThe standard approach is:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times the digit appears by considering higher, current, and lower digits.\n\nBut since this might be more complicated, and given that I've already calculated it by breaking it down into complete cycles and partial cycles, and the result seems consistent, I think 91 is the correct difference.\n\nWait, but let me just verify the counts again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nEach 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8. 488 pages have 48 full tens and 8 extra pages. So, 48*1=48, plus in the last 8 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once, so total 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach 100 pages contribute 10 fours and 10 eights. 488 pages have 4 full hundreds and 88 extra pages. In the 88 extra pages, the tens digits go up to 8, so 4 appears 10 times (in 441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 4*10=40 +10=50 fours, 4*10=40 +8=48 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nSo, 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 consecutive numbers contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 fours and 48 eights.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - **Total:** 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each group of 100 consecutive numbers contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete groups of 100, contributing 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) add 10 fours (441-450) and 8 eights (481-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 fours, 48 eights.\n\n3. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99 have no hundreds digit.\n   - Pages 100-399 have hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, contributing no 4's or 8's.\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total:** 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}."

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), 3-digit (100-488).\n\nI think the best approach is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Then, sum them up for each digit.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many times does this happen? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think it's 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490). But wait, 488 is less than 490, so the last group is 481-488. So, in the units place, how many 4's? It should be 48 times, but wait, does the 488 include a 4 in the units place? 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 481-488. So yes, 48 times for the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit 4 occur? It's every 10 pages, so 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many terms there are, we can calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. Oh, so I was wrong earlier. It's 49 times because 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place for 4: 49 times.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, the digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449, because 450-459 would still be within 488, but 440-449 is the last full set before 450. Wait, no, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Let's count how many such sets there are.\n\nFrom 1-99: 40-49 is one set, so 10 numbers.\nFrom 100-199: 140-149 is another set, another 10.\nFrom 200-299: 240-249, another 10.\nFrom 300-399: 340-349, another 10.\nFrom 400-488: 440-449, another 10.\nSo that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So 5 x 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 5 sets, 50 times.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, the hundreds digit is only the first digit, so each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89.\n\nLet me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times? Let's see, the first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many terms? The last term is 488, which is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. So, units place: 49 times.\n\n2. Tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many full sets we have.\n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89 is one set, 10 numbers.\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, another 10.\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, another 10.\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10.\nFrom 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 488 - 480 +1 = 9.\n\nSo, the first four sets each contribute 10, and the last set contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 +9 =49 times.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0 =98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98 =90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. That seems right.\n\nAnd for the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9, plus the other four sets of 10, totaling 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify. Another way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit place separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nFor the units place, as done earlier, 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nFor the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 4: floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, but 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But since 488 ends with 8, which is >=4, so add 1, making it 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8: floor(488/10) + (if last digit >=8, add 1). 488/10=48.8, floor is 48. Last digit is 8, which is >=8, so add 1, making it 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4: Each full hundred contributes 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), but wait, no, from 1-488, the hundreds are 0-4. Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many full tens cycles there are.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times a digit appears in the tens place can be calculated as:\n\nFor each hundred, the digit appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, 40-49 is 10 times. Similarly for 100-200, 140-149, etc.\n\nSo, for 4 in the tens place, how many hundreds? From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 times, and then 400-488, which contributes another 10 times (440-449). So, 5 sets, 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, from 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.), and then in 400-488, 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 4 x 10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor 8, there are no numbers from 800-899, so 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this occurs 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, '4' appears 89 times.\n\nTotal '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit '8' appears 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears 49 times (including 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** '8' does not appear here.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' appears 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Because the number of times a digit appears in each place can be calculated independently, and then I can sum them up for the total count of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers. Since there are 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete cycles of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete cycles and then 8 extra numbers.\n\nIn each complete cycle, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times, and the same for 8. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units digits: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, so in units place, they are equal. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The remaining numbers after 480 are 481 to 488. So, the units digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So yes, units place contributes 49 times each. So, units place doesn't contribute more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, how many complete hundreds are in 488? That's 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), same for 8. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times each. Now, the remaining 88 pages: 401-488.\n\nIn the tens place for 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? From 401-409, the tens digit is 0, so that's 9 times. From 410-419, it's 1, so 10 times, and so on up to 480-488, which is 8 in the tens place, but only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them except 480, which is 8 in the tens place? Wait, 480 is 480, so the tens digit is 8. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but when considering the tens digit in 401-488, let me think again. From 401-410: tens digit is 0 for 401-410? Wait, no, 401-410 would have tens digits from 0 to 0 (since 401 is 4-0-1, 402 is 4-0-2, up to 410, which is 4-1-0. Wait, no, 410 is 4-1-0, so the tens digit is 1. So, actually, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, which is 9 numbers, and then 1 for 410. So, the tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 440-449 would have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in 401-488. Similarly, 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place, but how many times? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit d from 0 to 8, the number of times it appears is 10, except for the last one, which might be less if the total doesn't complete the cycle. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the tens digit for 480-488 is 8, and that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, in the incomplete hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4 appears 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 times. 8 appears 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is ahead by 1 here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit cycles every 1000 numbers, but since our book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, 4 is ahead by 89 here.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place:\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the units place, I thought 4 appears 49 times and 8 appears 49 times, but let me verify that.\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nUnits digit cycles every 10. So, number of complete cycles: floor(488/10) = 48. Each cycle contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49, 8: 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 times each digit. So, 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 for 4 and 4*10=40 for 8. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total tens place: 40+10=50 for 4, 40+9=49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 never appears. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like 90 is a lot. Let me think again. Maybe I overcounted in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nBut let me check if I'm counting correctly in the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. And 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is a significant number. So, 89 more 4's than 8's just from the hundreds place. So, maybe 90 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. How many times does 4 appear in total? Let's think:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal: 49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in all page numbers of a 488-page book. We analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears equally every 10 pages.\n   - Complete cycles: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 with a remainder of 8).\n   - Each digit appears 48 times.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n   - Total: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (1-400), contributing 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - '4' appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - '4' appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference**: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), or three-digit (100-488).\n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each position in the page numbers separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every group of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such groups are there?\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 full groups and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - So, in each group of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times.\n   - Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484).\n   - So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Now, looking at the tens place. For every group of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - How many such groups are there in 488 pages?\n   - Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n   - In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449, which is another 10 occurrences.\n   - Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10.\n   - So total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding all these up for 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, for every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - So, 48 times in the units place.\n   - In the last group, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once (488).\n   - So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For the tens place, 8 appears in groups like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - In each hundred, there's a group of 10 where the tens digit is 8.\n   - So, in 488 pages, how many such groups are there?\n   - 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n   - In each hundred, 10 occurrences, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since 488 is the last page, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But wait, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. However, in page numbers, each number is unique, so 480, 481, ..., 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? It's 9 times, right? Because from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, that's 9 occurrences.\n   - Wait, but earlier I thought each hundred contributes 10, but in the last partial hundred, it's only 9. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this case. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when counting the tens place for 8's, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recount.\n\nIn the tens place, 8 appears in the tens digit for every group of 100, specifically in the 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489 ranges.\n\nBut since the book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in each of the first four hundreds (1-400), there's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, 49 8's in the tens place, which matches my earlier count.\n\nNow, for the units place, I had 49, and hundreds place 0, so total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49, tens place 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I did the 4's, I had 188, and 8's as 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48 +1=49.\n\n- Tens place: In each hundred, 10 occurrences, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48 +1=49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place, for 8's:\n\n- From 1-100: 80-89, so 10 numbers.\n\n- From 101-200: 180-189, 10 numbers.\n\n- From 201-300: 280-289, 10 numbers.\n\n- From 301-400: 380-389, 10 numbers.\n\nThat's 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 401-488: the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 40 +9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miss something. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the remainder is 8, so from 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48 +1=49.\n\n- Tens place: floor(488/100)=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the remainder is 88, so in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: floor(488/10)=48, so 48. Remainder 8, so 488 has units digit 8, so +1. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Remainder is 88, so in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So, the pages go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers will be from 1 up to 488, so the digits can be 1, 2, or 3 digits long. \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each position one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** \n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 full blocks and then 8 more pages (481-488).\n   - So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times from the full blocks and once more in the last partial block (484), so total 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - So, how many such blocks are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, which means 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n   - Each full block contributes 10 instances of 4 in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 4*10=40 times.\n   - Now, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, ..., up to 8 for 480-488. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 instances.\n   - So, total in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. For the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Then, in the tens place, 40 from the full blocks and 10 from 440-449, so 50. Units place: 49. So total 89+50+49=188. Hmm, maybe that's correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4, every block of 10 has one 8 in the units place.\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - Each full block contributes 1, so 48 times. The last 8 pages are 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit 8 appears once more (488).\n   - So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - There are 4 full blocks of 100 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n   - Each full block contributes 10, so 4*10=40.\n   - In the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we only have up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. Wait, no: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here.\n   - So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the occurrences of 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I got 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me check again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount the 8's in the tens place. When I was calculating the tens place for 8's, I considered the last partial block as 401-488. So, the tens digit cycles every 100, so in 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, it's from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 instances of 8 in the tens place in the last partial block. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10=40 from the first four blocks, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place for 8's was 49, and tens place 49, so total 98. But wait, let me check the units place again. For the units place, in each block of 10, there's one 8. So, 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last 8 pages are 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit 8 appears once more. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nNow, for 4's, I had 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes I might have double-counted or missed something.\n\nWait, for 4's in the hundreds place: pages 400-488. That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nIn the tens place: every 100 pages, 10 times. So, 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, etc.) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40+10=50.\n\nUnits place: every 10 pages, 1 time. 48 full blocks (1-480) gives 48, plus 484 in the last 8 pages (481-488), so 49.\n\nSo, 89+50+49=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTens place: 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, etc.) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 40+9=49.\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks (1-480) each contributing 1, so 48, plus 488 in the last 8 pages, so 49.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I was counting the 8's in the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but 480 is the first one, and 488 is the last. So, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total 8's are 98, and 4's are 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when I do these digit counting problems, I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check that again.\n\nFor 4's in the hundreds place: pages 400-488. That's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I should include page 0 or not, but since the first page is 1, page 0 doesn't exist, so no problem there.\n\nAnother way to think about it: maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For 4: number of times is (488 // 10) + (1 if 488 % 10 >=4 else 0). Wait, 488 //10 is 48, and 488 %10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\n- For 8: same way, (488 //10) + (1 if 488 %10 >=8 else 0). 488//10=48, 488%10=8, so 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4: number of times is (488 // 100)*10 + extra. So, 488//100=4, so 4*10=40. Then, the last partial hundred is 401-488. The tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40+10=50. Correct.\n\n- For 8: same way, (488 //100)*10=4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4: (488 - 400 +1)=89. Correct.\n\n- For 8: 0.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49+50+89=188; 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference is 90.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 pages, 4 appears once. There are 48 full decades (1-480) contributing 48 instances.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Four full centuries (1-400) contribute 4\u00d710=40.\n   - In 401-488, 440-449 adds another 10.\n   - Total: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 pages.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4, 48 full decades contribute 48, with 488 adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Four full centuries contribute 4\u00d710=40.\n   - In 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 more.\n   - Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\nThe digit 4 appears 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that each page number is printed once, starting from 1 and going up to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI remember that when counting digits in numbers, it's helpful to break it down by the units place, tens place, hundreds place, etc. So, maybe I should consider each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position one by one.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times from the full blocks. Now, in the extra numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is in this range, which means the units digit 4 appears once more.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times.\n   - So, in each block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - How many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488).\n   - In each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Specifically, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n   - Wait, but we're looking for when the tens digit is 4. So, in the range 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 times.\n   - So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). Wait, let me check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, yes, each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to counting the number of 8's.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - Number of full blocks in 488: 48, so 48 times.\n   - Now, the extra numbers are 481-488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488.\n   - So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8.\n   - Number of full hundreds in 488: 4, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n   - Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 times.\n   - So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check the tens place again. In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nNow, the total number of 4's is 188 and 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. Let me go back.\n\nWhen counting the tens place for 4's, I considered each full hundred block contributing 10 times, so 4 blocks would be 40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), I considered that the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, the remaining 88 numbers include 480-488, which is 9 numbers with tens digit 8, so 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. That's correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades (1-480) contribute 48 occurrences. The last 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full centuries (1-400) contribute 40 occurrences. The last 88 pages (401-488) include 10 occurrences (440-449), totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades contribute 48 occurrences.

The last 88 pages include 9 occurrences (480-488), totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I guess I should understand what the problem is asking. Each page from 1 to 488 has a page number, and each digit in those numbers is printed. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears, and then find the difference between those two counts.\n\nSo, maybe I should break it down by the number of digits in the page numbers. Pages 1 through 9 are single-digit, pages 10 through 99 are two-digit, 100 through 999 are three-digit, and so on. But since the book only has 488 pages, I don't need to go beyond three digits. Wait, actually, 488 is a three-digit number, so I'll have single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. For each position, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 more numbers (481 to 488). In each complete set, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 numbers. Let me check: the remaining numbers are 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so no 4 or 8 in the units place. So, units place 4's are 48, and 8's are also 48.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (at 488), right? So, for the units place, 8's would be 48 (from the complete sets) plus 1 (from 488), making it 49. Hmm, that's a mistake I made earlier. So, the units place: 4's are 48, and 8's are 49. So, 8's are one more than 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, let me confirm. Each complete set of 10 has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 complete sets give 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, in the units place, total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so that's equal. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought 8's were 49 and 4's were 48, but actually, both are 49. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digits go from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4*100 + 88. So, there are four complete hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488.\n\nWait, no, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds (400-499), but since we only go up to 488, it's 400-488. So, let's see:\n\nFirst, for the tens place, in each complete hundred (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds do we have? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: that's four complete hundreds. So, in each of these, 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. So, that's 4*10 = 40 for 4's and 4*10 = 40 for 8's.\n\nNow, we have the last partial hundred: 400-488. Let's look at the tens place in this range. The tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It's only in 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for these 9 numbers. Therefore, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous counts:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 40 (from four complete hundreds) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from four complete hundreds) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles every 1000, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit position.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The question asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so we subtract 98 from 188.\n\n188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each complete set of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, contributing 48 each.\n- Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, 8's = 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each complete hundred (0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- There are four complete hundreds (0-399), so 4*10=40 for each digit.\n- Then, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, 4's in tens place: 10 times (440-449).\n- 8's in tens place: from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n- So, tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0 times. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit for 400-488 is 4, so that's 89 numbers, which is correct. The tens digit in 400-488: when the tens digit is 4, that's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. When the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. That seems right.\n\nWait, another way to check: maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For each 10 numbers, one 4 and one 8 in units place.\n- 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n- So, 48 each, plus the last 8 numbers: 481-488.\n- In 481-488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 48 +1 = 49 for 4's, 48 +1 = 49 for 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 hundreds (0-399), so 4*10=40 for each.\n- Then, in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n- For 4's in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n- For 8's in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n- So, 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n- 8's: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe 8's would have more, but no, 4's are more by 90. Let me see if I can think of another way to approach this, maybe by considering each digit position separately and using a formula.\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the count of a digit 'd' can be calculated as follows:\n\n- For units place: floor(n/10) + (1 if the current digit is >= d else 0)\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for counting digits in each position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for counting the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place, the number of times a digit 'd' appears from 1 to n is:\n\nunits = (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 1)\n\nWait, perhaps that's a bit too formulaic, and I might make a mistake. Maybe it's better to stick with the initial approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me check the counts again.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nEach 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 488 // 10 = 48, so 48 sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each.\n\nThen, the remaining 8 numbers are 481-488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 4's = 48 +1=49, 8's=48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach 100 numbers contribute 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 488 // 100 =4, so 4 sets, each contributing 10 each. So, 4*10=40 for both 4's and 8's.\n\nThen, the remaining 88 numbers (400-488) have tens digits from 0 to 8. For the tens digit being 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For the tens digit being 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's:40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the difference seems quite large. Let me check if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position and add them up.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: floor(488/10) =48, plus 1 if the last digit is >=4. But wait, the last digit is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The formula is a bit more involved. The number of times a digit 'd' appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nunits = (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, but for d=4, it's (488//10)*1 + (1 if 488%10 >=4 else 0) =48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8: (488//10)*1 + (1 if 488%10 >=8 else 0) =48 +1=49.\n\nSo, units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nThe formula for the tens place is a bit more complex. The number of times a digit 'd' appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\ntens = (n // 100) * 10 + (if (n % 100) >= d*10 then (n % 100 - d*10 +1) else 0)\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\ntens_4 = (488 // 100) *10 + max(0, (488 % 100) - 40 +1)\n=4*10 + max(0, 88 -40 +1)\n=40 + max(0,49)\n=40 +49=89? Wait, that can't be right because in the tens place, 4 can't appear 89 times. Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is:\n\nFor each digit position, the count is:\n\nhigher = n // (position *10)\ncurrent = (n // position) %10\nlower = n % position\n\nif current > d: count += (higher +1) * position\nelif current == d: count += higher * position + lower +1\nelse: count += (higher) * position\n\nWait, perhaps that's more accurate. Let me try that.\n\nFor the tens place (position=10):\n\nd=4:\n\nhigher = 488 // (10*10) =488//100=4\ncurrent = (488 //10) %10=48%10=8\nlower =488%10=8\n\nSince current=8 > d=4,\n\ncount = (higher +1)*10 = (4+1)*10=5*10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n\nhigher=4\ncurrent=8\nlower=8\n\nSince current=8 >=d=8,\n\ncount = higher*10 + lower +1 =4*10 +8 +1=40+9=49.\n\nSo, tens place: 4's=50, 8's=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nposition=100.\n\nd=4:\n\nhigher=488 // (100*10)=488//1000=0\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4%10=4\nlower=488%100=88\n\nSince current=4 >=d=4,\n\ncount= higher*100 + lower +1=0*100 +88 +1=89.\n\nFor d=8 in hundreds place:\n\nhigher=0\ncurrent=4 <8,\nso count= higher*100=0.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50+89=188.\n\n8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=49+49=98.\n\nDifference=188-98=90.\n\nOkay, so using the formula approach, I get the same result. So, the initial calculation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full sets, contributing 48 each.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, adding one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 full hundreds, contributing 40 each.\n   - In 400-488, 440-449 adds 10 4's, and 480-488 adds 9 8's.\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488 has 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that each page number is printed once, from 1 to 488. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me break it down by the places where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10 and take the integer part. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which means 48 times. But wait, I should check if 488 is included. The last number with a 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence because 484 = 48*10 + 4. So, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages. So, in each of these 4 hundreds, there's a block where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 each. So, 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, the 400-488 range also includes the 440-449 block, which is another 10. So, that's 5 blocks in total? Wait, no, because 400-488 is part of the 400s, which is the fifth hundred? Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s, which is the 4th hundred? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, so 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 48, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 48+50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last occurrence is 488. So, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. So, ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. How many such blocks are there in 488? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-489: But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, does that count as a full block? No, because it's only 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 has 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, how many full blocks? 4 blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Plus the partial block from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 onwards. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the occurrences of 8:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nWait, let me check again. Units: 48, Tens:49, so total 97. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me recount:\n\n- From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n\n80-89: 10\n180-189:10\n280-289:10\n380-389:10\n480-488:9\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, I had 5 blocks:\n\n40-49:10\n140-149:10\n240-249:10\n340-349:10\n440-449:10\n\nThat's 5*10=50, correct.\n\nAnd hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, 48 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=187.\n\nAnd for 8's:48+49=97.\n\nSo, 187-97=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 4's. The first page is 1, so the first 4 is at page 4, then every 10 pages. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? Let's see: 484 is 48*10 +4, so 48 times. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is 48*10 +8, so 48 times. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8 and find the difference between the two counts. That should give me the answer.\n\nLet me start by understanding how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, the numbers can be from 1 to 999, but actually, since it's 488, the highest is 488.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll count the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - How many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - So, in each of the 48 full blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 * 1 = 48 fours.\n   - Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. The digit 4 appears once here (484).\n   - So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488).\n   - In each full block, there are 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 fours.\n   - Now, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, ..., up to 8 for 480-488. Wait, but we're looking for the tens digit being 4. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n   - Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, the last partial block adds another 10 fours.\n   - So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n   - Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me check. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's actually 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check, especially the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - Up to 488, there are 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1 eight, so 48 * 1 = 48.\n   - The last partial block is 481-488, which includes 488. The units digit here is 8 only once (488).\n   - So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - There are 4 full blocks of 100 up to 400, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but actually, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Wait, 480 has tens digit 8, 481 has 8, up to 488. So that's 9 numbers, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, but 480 is 480, 481 is 481, up to 488, which is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So that's 9 eights.\n   - So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The tens digit being 8 in 401-488 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is included, so 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So yes, 9.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 from page 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so no 8's there. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 4's in the tens place, in each block of 100, 10 fours, so 4 blocks give 40, and then in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So total 50 fours in the tens place. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place: 49, correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: 40 (from the four blocks) plus 9 (from 480-488), so 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might not be correct because 90 seems a bit high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, another way to count is to consider each digit place separately and see if I can find a formula or a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit place as follows:\n\nFor units place:\n\n- Number of 4's: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1 =49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: floor(488 /10)=48, plus if last digit >=8, which it is, so 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\n- Number of 4's: floor(488 / 100)=4, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, check the last partial hundred. The tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So total 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: floor(488 /100)=4, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, check the last partial hundred: the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So total 49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\n- Number of 4's: if the hundreds digit is 4, then from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So 89 fours.\n\nNumber of 8's: hundreds digit is 8 would be from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up again:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, so that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me confirm: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book stops at 488, it's only up to 488, so 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only once, from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers will be from 1 to 9 (one-digit), 10 to 99 (two-digit), and 100 to 488 (three-digit). \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such sets are there?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the full sets and once more in the last partial set (481-488, where 484 has a 4 in the units place). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. Actually, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (each decade has 10 numbers) plus any additional numbers where 4 appears in the units place.\n\nThe number of complete decades is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). So, in each complete decade, 4 appears once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), we have 484 as the only number where 4 is in the units place. So, that's 1 more. So, total 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the last page is 488, which is 488. So, the last partial decade is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, yes, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers, so each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nLet's count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is within 1-99. Then, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is up to 449, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488. So, how many blocks is that?\n\nFrom 40-49: that's one block.\nThen 140-149: another.\n240-249: another.\n340-349: another.\n440-449: another.\n\nSo, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50. \n\nWait, but wait a second. The last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, no. Actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems a bit high, but let's see.\n\nWait, let me think about the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8.\n\nSimilarly, I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete decades are there? 48 complete decades (as before), each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), how many 8's are there in the units place? The number 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial cycle is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8. So, total 49.\n\nNow, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last partial block.\n\nEach full block (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many full blocks there are.\n\nFrom 80-89: that's one block.\n180-189: another.\n280-289: another.\n380-389: another.\n480-488: this is a partial block.\n\nSo, how many full blocks? The first four blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the last block is 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of these has an 8, so that's 9 more 8's.\n\nWait, but wait. 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from full blocks) + 9 (from the last partial block) = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n180-189: 10.\n280-289: 10.\n380-389: 10.\n480-488: 9.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49. Correct, as each decade has one, and the last partial decade adds one more.\n\nTens place: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40. Plus the last partial block 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility I'm missing something? For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but does that include 400? Yes, because 400 is included. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 4's, I considered 440-449 as a block, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as a partial block, but in reality, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9 8's. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nEach decade (1-10, 11-20, etc.) has one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete decades (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial decade is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the units place, same logic: 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4, and the last partial decade (481-488) includes 484, which is one more. So, 49. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 4's in the tens place. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one is partial. Wait, no: 80-89 is one, 180-189 is two, 280-289 is three, 380-389 is four, and 480-488 is five. So, five blocks, but the first four are full, the last is partial. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 from the partial, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the 4's case, the last block for the tens place is 440-449, which is fully within 488, so that's a full block. So, 5 blocks, each full, so 50. Correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a large number. Let me see if I can find another way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately by considering each digit place.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 10) + (1 if 488 % 10 >= 4 else 0) \u2192 floor(48.8) = 48, and 488 % 10 = 8, which is >=4, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: floor(488 / 10) + (1 if 488 % 10 >=8 else 0) \u2192 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 100) * 10 + (if (488 % 100) >= 40 and <50 then (488 % 100 - 40 + 1) else 0). Wait, maybe that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for the tens place, the number of times 4 appears is equal to the number of complete hundreds (each contributing 10 4's in the tens place) plus the partial hundred if applicable.\n\nSo, for 4's in the tens place:\n\nEach hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 4's in tens place: 4 * 10 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nEach hundred block has a block where the tens digit is 8, which is 10 numbers. So, in 0-99, 80-89 is 10 numbers. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and in the last partial hundred, 480-488. So, how many complete hundreds? 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9 more. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: From 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** In every set of ten numbers, '4' appears once.

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a number from 1 to 488, right? So I'm looking at all these numbers and counting how many times the digit 4 appears versus how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are counted in numbers. I remember that when counting digits, it's often helpful to look at each digit place separately\u2014like units, tens, hundreds, etc. So maybe I should analyze the number of 4's and 8's in each place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet's begin with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So each digit appears once. Similarly, from 11 to 20, the units digits again cycle through 1 to 0. This pattern continues every 10 numbers.\n\nSo, to find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages and then see how many 4's are in the remaining numbers.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So for 48 blocks, that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, in each block of 10, 8 appears once. So again, 48 blocks give 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So the difference here is zero. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place over 100 numbers.\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of 4's in the tens place. Each time the tens digit is 4, it's for 10 consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. So in each 100 numbers, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So when does the tens digit equal 4? That would be from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's another 10 times. So total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, 401-488 includes 401 to 488, which is 88 numbers. So the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, that's 10 more 4's. So total 50.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in the tens place. Let's do the same. In each complete hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 numbers. So total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, so 4's in tens place: 50, 8's in tens place: 49. So the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case because the book has 488 pages. So the hundreds digit can be 1 (1-99), 2 (100-199), 3 (200-299), or 4 (300-399), and then from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nWait, but actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so 0 times. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, so 0 times. From 200-299, hundreds digit is 2, so 0 times. From 300-399, hundreds digit is 3, so 0 times. From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, how about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49 \u2192 difference 0\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49 \u2192 difference +1\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0 \u2192 difference +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each 10 numbers contribute 1 to 4's and 1 to 8's. So 48 full decades (480 numbers) give 48 each. Then, from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. So units place: 49 each, difference 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each 100 numbers, 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place. So 4 complete hundreds: 4*10=40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles 0-8. So for 4's in tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. For 8's in tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49. Difference +1. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in hundreds place. 8 never appears in hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So 89 - 0 =89. That seems correct.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =90.\n\nWait, but wait a second, when I was counting the units place, I considered 488 as part of the remaining 8 numbers, so units digit 8 appears once, correct. Similarly, for the tens place, in the remaining 88 numbers, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nBut let me think again: in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So when the tens digit is 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining part. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so 488 is the last page. So yes, 488 is included in the 400-488 range, so 89 numbers.\n\nSo, adding up, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, hold on, no, wait. Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Wait, no, the problem is that I'm adding the counts for 4's and separately for 8's, but I was supposed to compute the difference between the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, let me correct that. So, the total number of 4's is:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, total number of 8's is:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the number of 4's is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference per place was 0, +1, +89, totaling 90. So that's consistent.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each 10 numbers: 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n- 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full decades: 48*1=48 for 4's, same for 8's.\n- Remaining 8 numbers: 481-488. Units digits:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n- So 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n- Total units:48+1=49 for both 4's and 8's. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each 100 numbers: 10 times 4, 10 times 8 in the tens digit.\n- 488 /100=4.88, so 4 full centuries:4*10=40 for both 4's and 8's.\n- Remaining 88 numbers:401-488.\n- Tens digits in 401-488: from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488).\n- For 4's in tens place: when tens digit is 4, which is 440-449:10 numbers, so 10 more 4's.\n- For 8's in tens place: when tens digit is 8, which is 480-488:9 numbers, so 9 more 8's.\n- So total 4's in tens:40+10=50; 8's:40+9=49.\n- Difference:50-49=1. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488:89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place, since the book ends at 488.\n- So 89-0=89. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I included all the numbers correctly. For example, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, so 88+1=89. So 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. That's correct. And when the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, so 8+1=9. So that's correct.\n\nUnits place:481-488 is 8 numbers, so units digits 1-8, each appearing once. So 4 and 8 each appear once, adding to 49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. So the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting Digits in Each Place:**\n   - We analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately to count how many times the digits 4 and 8 appear.\n\n2. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 49\n\n3. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contains 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks of 100, contributing 40 each.\n   - The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) add 10 more 4's (440-449) and 9 more 8's (480-488).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 49\n\n4. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n5. **Summing Up:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and each number is printed once. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me break this down by looking at each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll consider each place value one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the digits in the units place are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, the digit 4 appears once in every block of 10 numbers, and the same goes for 8. Therefore, in each block of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 more pages (481 to 488). In each of these 48 blocks, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, that's 48 times each for units place. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times, 49 each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 numbers. For example, from 1-10, the tens digit is 0 or 1, but actually, in page numbers, the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, right? Wait, no, page numbers are from 1 to 488, so pages 1-9 are single-digit, but when considering two-digit numbers, the tens digit starts at 1 for pages 10-19, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the tens place in all numbers, including single-digit ones. But for single-digit numbers, the tens digit is 0, so maybe I should consider that as well. Hmm, but 0 isn't a digit we're counting here, so perhaps it's better to think of the tens place in two-digit and three-digit numbers.\n\nLet me structure it properly. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in the range 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, actually, from 1-99, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. But wait, from 1-99, the tens digit for 1-9 is 0, so actually, 0 appears 9 times in the tens place for 1-9, and then 10 times for each digit from 1-9 in the tens place for 10-99.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me try a different approach. For the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. But actually, in 1-100, the tens digit for 1-9 is 0, so 0 appears 9 times in the tens place, and then from 10-99, each digit from 1-9 appears 10 times in the tens place, and then 100 has a tens digit of 0 again. Wait, no, 100 has a tens digit of 0, so in 1-100, the tens digit 0 appears 11 times (for 1-9 and 100), but maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that in each group of 100 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), etc., up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place in 1-100. Therefore, in 1-400, there are four sets of 100, so each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. But wait, 488 is more than 400, so I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the four complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place from 1-400.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8 here.\n\n411-420: tens digit is 1, so no.\n\n421-430: tens digit is 2, no.\n\n431-440: tens digit is 3, no.\n\n441-450: tens digit is 4. So, from 441-450, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 441,442,...,450. So, that's 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 451-460: tens digit is 5, no.\n\n461-470: tens digit is 6, no.\n\n471-480: tens digit is 7, no.\n\n481-490: tens digit is 8. But wait, our range is only up to 488, so from 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers: 481,482,...,488. So, that's 8 times.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of these, so that's 8 times.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place (481-488).\n\nTherefore, in the tens place overall, digit 4 appears 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 times, and digit 8 appears 40 + 8 = 48 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 48 = 2.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 1000 numbers, but since our book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWait, actually, page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the hundreds digit is:\n\n- 0 for pages 1-99,\n- 1 for pages 100-199,\n- 2 for pages 200-299,\n- 3 for pages 300-399,\n- 4 for pages 400-488.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 - 49 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 48 = 2\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nAdding these up: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal number of units digits: 488 pages, so units digits cycle every 10. 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, with 8 remaining pages.\n\nEach cycle contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8. So, 48 cycles give 48 each. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place total: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and same for 8. Difference is 0.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place (since 400 / 100 = 4, so 4 * 10 = 40). Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). In this range, 441-450 has tens digit 4, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. 481-488 has tens digit 8, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, total for tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8. Difference is 2.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly pages 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times for 4, 0 for 8. Difference is 89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place, I considered that from 401-488, the tens digit for 4 is 10 times and for 8 is 8 times. But let me make sure that's correct.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears how many times?\n\nEach tens digit in this range (401-488) appears 10 times, except the last one, which is 8 and appears only 8 times because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go as follows:\n\n- 0: 401-410 (10 pages)\n- 1: 411-420 (10)\n- 2: 421-430 (10)\n- 3: 431-440 (10)\n- 4: 441-450 (10)\n- 5: 451-460 (10)\n- 6: 461-470 (10)\n- 7: 471-480 (10)\n- 8: 481-488 (8 pages)\n\nSo, each tens digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, in this range, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, yes, my earlier calculation was correct.\n\nSo, adding up, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, no, wait, that's the total count for 4's. Similarly, for 8's, it's 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 91, but when I added up the differences per digit place, I got 0 + 2 + 89 = 91, which matches. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the hundreds place. Pages 400-488: that's 89 pages, right? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages, so 89 times. So, 89 is correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times, so difference of 2. Units place, same, difference 0.\n\nSo, total difference is 89 + 2 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can count the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the tens place correctly for 401-488. So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears 8 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once in the 40-49 range, but wait, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 1-488.\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488, 441-450: 10 times.\n\nTotal: 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488, 481-488: 8 times.\n\nTotal: 40 +8=48. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. So, 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nTherefore, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using digit frequency formulas or something.\n\nI remember that in a range from 1 to N, the number of times a digit d appears in each position can be calculated using a formula, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Maybe it's better to stick with my initial method since it's detailed and seems accurate.\n\nAnother way to think about it is for each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear, then sum them up.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly for 8: floor(488/10)=48, and since 8 >=8, add 1, so 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488/100)*10 + extra.\n\nWait, floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Now, the last two digits are 88. The tens digit is 8, which is >=4, so we need to see how many numbers from 400-488 have tens digit >=4. Wait, maybe this approach is more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, using the method I did earlier seems more straightforward.\n\nBut regardless, my initial calculation seems consistent, so I think 91 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete cycles: 48 (488 / 10 = 48.8).\n   - Remaining pages: 481-488, units digits include 4 once and 8 once.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete cycles: 4 (488 / 100 = 4.88), so 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit.\n   - Remaining pages (401-488):\n     - 441-450: 10 times for 4.\n     - 481-488: 8 times for 8.\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n   - Difference: 50 - 48 = 2.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nSumming the differences: 0 (units) + 2 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 91.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), or three-digit (100-488).\n\nThe problem is asking about the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in all these page numbers. Specifically, I need to count how many 4's are there in total and how many 8's, then find the difference between these two counts.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\n**1. Units Place:**\n\nFor the units digit, the pattern repeats every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place.\n\nSo, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and an extra 8 numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each complete set, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once.\n\nSo, for the units place:\n- Number of 4's: 48 sets * 1 = 48\n- Number of 8's: 48 sets * 1 = 48\n\nBut wait, there's an extra set from 481-488. Let's check the units digits in this extra set:\n- 481: units digit is 1\n- 482: 2\n- 483: 3\n- 484: 4\n- 485: 5\n- 486: 6\n- 487: 7\n- 488: 8\n\nSo, in the extra 8 numbers, the units digit is 4 once (484) and 8 once (488).\n\nTherefore, total for units place:\n- 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digit in 488 is 8, but in the 481-488 range, the units digits go up to 8, which is included. So, yes, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place in the extra set.\n\nSo, units place gives 49 of each digit, 4 and 8.\n\n**2. Tens Place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nSo, for each hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and the same for 8 (e.g., 80-89).\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Let's see:\n\nFrom 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488.\n\nSo, there are four complete hundreds (1-400) and an extra 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n- Number of 4's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40\n- Number of 8's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40\n\nNow, check the extra 88 pages (401-488). Let's break this down:\n\nThe tens digit in 401-488 cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, actually, 401-488 is 88 numbers, so the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except maybe the last one if 88 isn't a multiple of 10. Wait, 88 is 8*10 + 8, so the tens digit goes up to 8, which is 480-488, but actually, 401-488 is 88 numbers, so 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers), 411-420: 1, ..., 481-490: 8, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears only 8 times (481-488). Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so it's 8 times, not 10.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The extra part is from 401-488, which is 88 numbers. So, how many times does each tens digit appear?\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, for the tens digit in the extra 88 pages:\n- 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nTherefore, total for tens place:\n- 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from extra) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from extra) = 48\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. The complete hundreds are 1-400, which is 400 pages, so the next part is 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, in the extra 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times.\n\nSo, yes, the counts are correct as above.\n\n**3. Hundreds Place:**\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers from 100 onwards. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4 or 8 here.\n\nFrom 100-488: hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit 1\n- 200-299: hundreds digit 2\n- 300-399: hundreds digit 3\n- 400-488: hundreds digit 4\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, for the hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\n**4. Summing Up All Places:**\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 48\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, let me double-check these sums:\n\n4's:\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99; 99 + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Correct.\n\n8's:\n49 (units) + 48 (tens) = 97; 97 + 0 = 97. Correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's:\n\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\nSo, there are 91 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the counts.\n\nLet me go through each place again.\n\n**Units Place:**\n\n- 488 pages. Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 to 4 and 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units digits: 48 +1=49 for 4, same for 8. Correct.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n\n- Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 for each 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\n- Then, the extra 88 pages (401-488) have tens digits from 0 to 8, but in the extra part, 401-488 is 88 pages. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times do they appear?\n\nActually, each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears exactly 10 times in the 88 pages, except the last one. Wait, 88 pages is 8*10 + 8, so the tens digits go up to 8, but 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 10.\n\nWait, let me correct that. For the extra 88 pages:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: 1 (10)\n- 421-430: 2 (10)\n- 431-440: 3 (10)\n- 441-450: 4 (10)\n- 451-460: 5 (10)\n- 461-470: 6 (10)\n- 471-480: 7 (10)\n- 481-488: 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, yes, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total for tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48\n\nThat's correct.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n\n- From 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, 89 times 4 appears in hundreds place.\n\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place adds 89 to 4's and 0 to 8's.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with hundreds digit 4, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. Subtracting these gives 91 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me break it down by the digits' places: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 pages (like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). So, how many times does this happen? Since the book has 488 pages, I can divide 488 by 10 to get 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, it's 48 times. But wait, 488 itself ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within 488. So, units place gives us 48 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The book goes up to 488, so the last block is 440-449, which is within 488. So, that's 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nAdding these up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 pages (8, 18, 28, ..., 488). Let's see how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 times. Because 488 is the 49th occurrence in the units place. So, units place gives 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each block from 80-89, etc., up to 380-389 has 10 eights in the tens place. The 480-488 block has 9 eights (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, how many blocks? Let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 eights\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nAdding these up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 (since 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, but 484 is the last one, which is 48th occurrence)\n- Tens: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) each with 10, so 5*10=50\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89\nTotal: 48+50+89=187\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 488/10=48.8, so 49 times (since 488 is included)\n- Tens: 5 blocks as before, but the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 10+10+10+10+9=49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98\n\nDifference: 187-98=89.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 pages (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are counted in numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, the first few pages are single-digit, then two-digit, then three-digit.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. That way, I can systematically count each occurrence without missing any.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n   - For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - Now, how many full sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (from 481 to 488).\n   - So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the full sets, plus one more time in the partial set (484). Wait, but 484 is within the 480-489 range, but since we're only going up to 488, does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, etc.\n   - So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n   - Let's see, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place.\n   - Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488?\n   - The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges in total.\n   - So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, let's check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488.\n   - So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, the number of numbers is indeed 89 because 488 - 400 = 88, and adding 1 gives 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the units place, I thought there were 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4, and then one more in the 480-488 range. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit in 484 is 4, but from 480 to 488, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so only 484 has a units digit of 4. So, yes, that's correct. So units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nIn the tens place, each hundred has a 40-49 range, so 10 numbers each. From 0-99: 40-49 (10), 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to counting the number of 8's.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\nSimilarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there?\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. That's 48 times.\n   - Now, in the partial set from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more.\n   - So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.\n   - Wait, up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range.\n   - Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it's cut short.\n   - Let's see, how many such ranges are there?\n   - From 0-99: 80-89 (10)\n   - 100-199: 180-189 (10)\n   - 200-299: 280-289 (10)\n   - 300-399: 380-389 (10)\n   - 400-488: 480-488. Now, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, and the units digits go from 0 to 8, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So that's 9 occurrences in the tens place.\n   - So, for the first four ranges, each contributes 10, and the last contributes 9.\n   - So total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check that. From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so each number from 480 to 488 has 8 in the tens place. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So yes, 9 times.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me double-check.\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets (each contributing one 8) plus one more in the 480-488 range, so 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9), so 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount:\n\n4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 4's. Let me check that again.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, each hundred has a 40-49 range, contributing 10 4's. From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nWait, 400-488: the 40-49 range here would be 440-449, right? Because 400-409 is the hundreds place, but the tens digit is 4 in 440-449.\n\nSo, that's 10 numbers in each hundred, except the last one, which is 400-488. Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's fine. So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, the last range is 480-488, which gives 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in the 4's, the hundreds place is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nAnd for the 8's, there are none in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, which is less than 800.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the difference is 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - In the partial set (481-488), 484 contributes one more occurrence.\n   - Total in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total in tens place: \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - There are \\(488 - 400 + 1 = 89\\) numbers.\n   - Total in hundreds place: \\(89\\).\n\nTotal number of 4's: \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - In the partial set (481-488), 488 contributes one more occurrence.\n   - Total in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges each contribute 10 occurrences, and the range 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total in tens place: \\(4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total in hundreds place: \\(0\\).\n\nTotal number of 8's: \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\).\n\n**Difference:**\nThe number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by \\(188 - 98 = 90\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Because the number 488 has three digits, I'll need to check how many times the digit 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once (like on page 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the digit 8 appears once (like on page 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, right? \n\nBut wait, I should check if 488 is a multiple of 10. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, it's not a whole number. That means the last set of pages won't complete a full 10. So, in the units place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nLet me calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48 groups, with 8 pages remaining. So, in each of the 48 complete groups, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. That gives 48 times each. Now, the remaining 8 pages are 481 to 488. In the units place, 4 appears on page 484, and 8 appears on page 488. So, in the units place, 4 appears once more, making it 49, and 8 appears once, making it 49 as well. Wait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each? Hmm, that doesn't seem right because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 each. Then, the remaining pages are 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place total: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. So, units place is equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, for each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly for 8, it's 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many hundreds are there in 488 pages. It's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages remaining (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4, and 4 * 10 = 40 times for 8.\n\nNow, let's check the remaining 88 pages: 401 to 488. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for each ten in this partial hundred, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nFor the digit 4 in the tens place, it's from 440-449. But wait, the range is only up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, it's 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n- 4: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50\n- 8: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is more than 8 by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is the hundreds digit 4, right? So, the hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n- 4: 89\n- 8: 0\n\nSo, 4 is way more than 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in all places.\n\nStarting with 4:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check the hundreds place again. From page 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 on all those pages. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place, correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 40 from the full hundreds, then in the remaining 88 pages, 440-449 is 10 pages, so that's 10 more, making 50 for 4. For 8, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 40 + 9 = 49, correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), 484 has a 4 and 488 has an 8, so that's 1 each, making 49 each, correct.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's total: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but I'm a bit surprised because the hundreds place contributes so much. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: count how many times 4 appears in each digit place and 8 appears in each digit place separately.\n\nFor units place:\nTotal pages: 488\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, which it's 8, so 48 +1 =49\nSimilarly for 8: floor(488 /10)=48, and since last digit is 8, which is exactly 8, so 48 +1=49\n\nTens place:\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place: For each hundred, 10 times. So, 4 hundreds, 10 each: 40. Plus in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So total 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in tens place: 4 hundreds, 10 each: 40. In the last partial hundred, 480-488: 9 pages. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n4 appears from 400-488: 89 times.\n8 never appears in hundreds place, as 800 would be beyond 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I should break down the problem by considering each digit place separately: the units place and the tens place. Maybe even the hundreds place, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, right? So, let's start by looking at the units place.\n\nFor the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So in every block of 10 consecutive page numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once in the units place every 10 pages. So, to find out how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place, I can divide the total number of pages by 10 and see how many complete blocks there are, then multiply by 1 for each digit.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10, so I'll have a partial block at the end. Let me think about that. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. That means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages each, and then an additional 8 pages. In each complete block, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Now, for the remaining 8 pages, which are pages 481 to 488, I need to check if any of these have a 4 or 8 in the units place.\n\nLooking at pages 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (page 484), and the digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, adding that to the previous count, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, it's 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is included, so maybe I should check again.\n\nWait, when I have 48 complete blocks of 10, that's up to page 480. Then pages 481 to 488 are 8 pages. So, in page 484, the units digit is 4, and in 488, it's 8. So, yes, that's correct. So, units place gives 49 4's and 49 8's. Hmm, but that would mean they are equal in the units place, but I think maybe I made a mistake because 488 is included, so maybe the 8's count is one more? Wait, let me recount.\n\nWait, from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, so each digit 4 and 8 appears 48 times in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. So, same count in units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, right? So, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, for example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, ..., 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per 100 pages.\n\nSo, for the entire book of 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so there are 4 complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for each hundred, 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 times each. But wait, 488 is beyond 400, so we have an additional 88 pages (401-488). So, in the tens place for these 88 pages, how many times do 4 and 8 appear?\n\nLet's break it down. Pages 401-488: the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit, 4 appears in pages 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in pages 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). Wait, but wait, 480 is page 480, which is within 401-488, right? So, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 times), and 8 for 480-488 (9 times, since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous 4 hundreds, which gave 40 each, the total for the tens place would be:\n\nFor 4's: 40 (from first 400 pages) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nFor 8's: 40 (from first 400 pages) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and then 4 continues for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is only 1,2,3,4. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, adding up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? Each 10 pages have one 4. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have one more 4 (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: same calculation, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 pages), and 8 for 480-488 (9 pages). So, 4's: 40 +10=50; 8's:40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8's never appear in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 -400 =88, but since both ends are inclusive, it's 89. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for the last partial hundred. Let me check again. Pages 401-488: the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. When the tens digit is 8, that's pages 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages. So, yes, 10 and 9 respectively. So, 4's in tens place:10, 8's:9. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to count how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place up to N is floor((N)/10) + (1 if the remainder is >=d else 0). Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think.\n\nActually, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to:\n\nnumber_of_times = N // 10 * 1 + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, but for d=4, it's N//10 + (1 if (N%10)>=4 else 0). Similarly for d=8, it's N//10 + (1 if (N%10)>=8 else 0).\n\nWait, let's test this with N=488.\n\nFor 4's in units place: 488//10=48, and 488%10=8, which is >=4, so +1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nFor 8's in units place: 488//10=48, and 488%10=8, which is >=8, so +1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in the tens place up to N is:\n\nnumber_of_times = N // 100 * 10 + (if (N % 100) >= d*10 and (N % 100) < (d+1)*10 then (N % 100 - d*10 +1) else 0)\n\nWait, maybe that's more complicated, but let's try.\n\nFor d=4 in tens place up to 488:\n\nFirst, 488//100=4, so 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remaining part is 488%100=88. So, in the tens place, we're looking for numbers where the tens digit is 4. The tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49 in each hundred. So, in the remaining 88 pages (which are 401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 more times. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n\n488//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nRemaining 88: the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). So, 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nDigit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages. Digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place here.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and each number is printed once. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each place one by one because the occurrence of digits can vary depending on the position.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the digit 4 will appear once every 10 pages, and the same goes for the digit 8.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 more pages. In each of these 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nBut wait, there are 8 extra pages beyond the 480th page. These are pages 481 to 488. Let's check the units digits here: 481 ends with 1, 482 with 2, and so on up to 488 ending with 8. So, in these 8 pages, the units digit 4 doesn't appear because the units digits go from 1 to 8, missing 4. The digit 8 does appear once in the units place on page 488. \n\nSo, for the units place:\n- Number of 4's: 48 (from the complete blocks) + 0 (from the extra pages) = 48\n- Number of 8's: 48 (from the complete blocks) + 1 (from the extra pages) = 49\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, 8's actually appear one more time than 4's. But let's not get ahead of ourselves; we need to check the tens place as well.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each block of 100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 for each set of 10 pages. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digits are 0 for 0-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each 100-page block, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place.\n\nIn our case, we have 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in the full hundreds. Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4 x 10 = 40 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit in this range goes from 0 to 8 because 401-410 have a tens digit of 0, 411-420 have 1, and so on up to 481-488 having a tens digit of 8. \n\nWait, but the tens digit for 401-488 is from 0 to 8, but each set of 10 pages contributes one digit. So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here?\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). \n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 441-450, which is 10 pages. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 481-488, which is 8 pages.\n\nTherefore, in the remaining 88 pages:\n- Number of 4's in tens place: 10\n- Number of 8's in tens place: 8\n\nAdding this to the earlier 40 from the full hundreds:\n- Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times. That's two more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it only changes every 100 pages. For a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes from 0 (for pages 1-99) to 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). \n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nNow, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 0 appears 99 times (pages 1-99)\n- 1 appears 100 times (100-199)\n- 2 appears 100 times (200-299)\n- 3 appears 100 times (300-399)\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n\nWait, let me check that. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n- Number of 4's: 89\n- Number of 8's: 0 (since 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place for any page in 1-488)\n\nThat's a significant difference. So, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's don't appear at all.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nNow for 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check these sums because earlier I thought 4's were higher in the tens place, but let's make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding.\n\n4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187\n\n8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 48\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 48 = 97\n\nSo, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 97.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems quite a large number. Let me go through each digit place again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each 10 pages, 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full tens and 8 extra pages.\n- So, units place: 48 each, but in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once, 4 doesn't. So, units place: 4's = 48, 8's = 49.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- 488 pages have 4 full hundreds (1-400) and 88 extra pages (401-488).\n- In each full hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40 for each.\n- In the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488).\n- So, for 4 in the tens place: 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- For 8 in the tens place: 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n- So, total tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4 or 8.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive).\n- So, hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nAdding them up:\n- 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. For the hundreds digit, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nAnd for the tens place in the extra 88 pages, 481-488: the tens digit is 8, but only for 8 pages, right? So, 8 appears 8 times in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, the extra 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1 through 8, so 8 appears once, and 4 doesn't appear. So, units place: 4's = 48, 8's = 49.\n\nYes, that all adds up correctly. So, the total number of 4's is 187, and 8's is 97, so the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - In 488 pages, there are 48 full tens and 8 extra pages.\n   - 4's: 48 times (once per 10 pages).\n   - 8's: 48 times from full tens + 1 from extra pages = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - In 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds and 88 extra pages.\n   - 4's: 40 times from full hundreds + 10 from 441-450 = 50 times.\n   - 8's: 40 times from full hundreds + 8 from 481-488 = 48 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0.\n   - Pages 100-399: hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3.\n   - Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n   - 4's: 89 times.\n   - 8's: 0 times.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 97 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's asking for the difference between the number of times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and the number of times the digit 8 appears. So, I need to count how many 4's there are in total and how many 8's there are, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nAlright, so the book has pages numbered from 1 to 488. Each page number is printed once, so I need to consider each digit in these numbers. That means I'll have to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc., depending on how many digits the page numbers have.\n\nLet me start by considering how many digits each page number has. Pages 1 through 9 are single-digit numbers, pages 10 through 99 are two-digit, pages 100 through 488 are three-digit numbers. So, I'll need to handle each of these ranges separately.\n\nI think the best approach is to calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then sum them up. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to get the answer.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\n**Units Place:**\n\nFor the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten consecutive numbers. So, in every block of ten numbers, each digit appears once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once and 8 appears once in each block of ten.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 complete blocks, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, that's 48 times each.\n\nThen, in the incomplete block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the incomplete block is actually 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, yes, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so the units digits in the incomplete block are correct. So, units place for both 4 and 8 is 49 each.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nBut wait, in the first hundred, pages 1-9 have 0 in the tens place, so 0 appears 9 times? Wait no, actually, for pages 1-9, the tens digit is 0, but when considering two-digit numbers, from 10 onwards, the tens digit starts at 1. Wait, maybe I'm complicating this.\n\nLet me think again. For the tens place, in each hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the incomplete hundred (401-488).\n\nSo, for each of the 4 complete hundreds, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4*10=40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 40 times in the tens place from the complete hundreds.\n\nNow, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits are as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears once in the block 441-450, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears once in the block 481-488, but wait, 481-488 is only 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, but how many times does 8 appear? Let's see, from 481 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all 8 numbers, so 8 appears 8 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, but I'm only considering the tens digit. So, in 441-450, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. In 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, so 8 appears 8 times in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, in the incomplete hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from incomplete) = 50\n8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from incomplete) = 48\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. In the incomplete hundred, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8, but the number of times each digit appears depends on how many numbers are in each block.\n\nFrom 401-410: 10 numbers, tens digit 0\n411-420: 10 numbers, tens digit 1\n421-430: 10 numbers, tens digit 2\n431-440: 10 numbers, tens digit 3\n441-450: 10 numbers, tens digit 4\n451-460: 10 numbers, tens digit 5\n461-470: 10 numbers, tens digit 6\n471-480: 10 numbers, tens digit 7\n481-488: 8 numbers, tens digit 8\n\nSo, for the tens digit 4, it's 10 numbers (441-450), so 10 times.\n\nFor the tens digit 8, it's 8 numbers (481-488), so 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the incomplete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, adding to the complete hundreds, 4's in tens place: 4*10 +10=50\n8's in tens place: 4*10 +8=48\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:50, 8's:48.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so we can ignore that.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears for a block of 100 pages each. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit cycles every 1000 pages, but since we only go up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (not printed, as they are two-digit or single-digit numbers)\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nSo, each hundreds digit appears for 100 pages, except the last one, which is only 89 pages (400-488 is 89 pages, because 488-400+1=89).\n\nWait, 488-400=88, so 88+1=89 pages.\n\nSo, let's calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFirst, 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page numbers were 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n4's:89\n8's:0\n\n**Total Count:**\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's=49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's=49+48+0=97\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97.\n\nThe question asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so we subtract 97 from 188.\n\n188-97=91\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each digit place again.\n\n**Units Place:**\n\n- Each block of 10 has 1 four and 1 eight.\n- 488/10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight, so 48 each.\n- The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once.\n- Total units:48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n\n- Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8.\n- The incomplete hundred (401-488) has:\n  - For 4: 10 numbers (441-450), so 10 fours.\n  - For 8: 8 numbers (481-488), so 8 eights.\n- So, total tens place:\n  - 4's:40+10=50\n  - 8's:40+8=48\nThat seems correct.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n\n- 4's: pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours.\n- 8's: none, since the book ends at 488.\nThat's correct.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n4's:49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188\n8's:49(units)+48(tens)+0(hundreds)=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nHmm, 91 seems correct, but let me think if I missed anything.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, I considered that 4 appears 89 times because pages 400-488 are 89 pages. Let me verify that: 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nAnother way to think about the hundreds place is that for each hundred, the hundreds digit is fixed. So, for 1-100, hundreds digit is 1, but that's not relevant for 4's. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is only relevant for pages 100 and above. So, from 100-199, hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 3 appears 100 times each, and 4 appears 89 times. But since we're only counting 4's and 8's, 8 never appears in the hundreds place, and 4 appears 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, but 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 1 appears 100 times. Similarly, 2 appears 100 times, 3 appears 100 times, and 4 appears 89 times. So, 4's in hundreds place:89, 8's:0.\n\nAnother check: Let's think about how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the total number of digits used.\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, let me see if the total number of 4's and 8's makes sense.\n\nWait, 188 fours and 97 eights. The difference is 91, which seems plausible.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the incomplete hundred. From 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, etc., up to 8 for 481-488.\n\nSo, for the tens digit 4, it's in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place. For the tens digit 8, it's in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 eights in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, the count for 4's in the incomplete hundred is 10, and for 8's it's 8, so that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let me calculate the total number of digits in all page numbers.\n\nFrom 1-9: 9 single-digit numbers, 9 digits.\nFrom 10-99: 90 numbers, 2 digits each, so 180 digits.\nFrom 100-488: 389 numbers (488-100+1=389), 3 digits each, so 1167 digits.\nTotal digits:9+180+1167=1356 digits.\n\nNow, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97, so together that's 285 digits. The remaining digits are other numbers, which seems plausible.\n\nWait, but 1356 digits in total, and 285 are either 4's or 8's, which is about 21% of the digits, which seems reasonable.\n\nAnother way to think: In each digit place, the probability of a digit being 4 or 8 is roughly 1/10 each, so the total count should be roughly 1/10 of the total digits. 1356/10=135.6, so 135-136 of each digit. But since we're only counting 4's and 8's, the total would be around 270-272. But our counts are 188 and 97, which sum to 285, which is a bit higher, but considering that in some places (like the hundreds place), certain digits appear more often, it's possible.\n\nWait, but 188 is significantly higher than 135, so maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. Let me check again.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, each of those pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nBut wait, when we're considering the hundreds digit, each page from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, the other digits (1,2,3) appear 100 times each, but we're not counting them. So, 89 fours, and 0 eights.\n\nSo, perhaps the counts are correct.\n\nWait, but let me think: 4's in units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89, total 188.\n\n8's in units place:49, tens place:48, hundreds place:0, total 97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 91 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (1-400).\n   - Each digit appears 40 times in the tens place.\n   - Remaining pages (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **91**.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "num_tokens": 5754,

    "text": " Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a number from 1 to 488, right? So, I need to look at each digit in these numbers and count how many times the digit 4 appears versus how many times the digit 8 appears.\n\nMaybe I should start by considering how numbers are formed. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I guess I need to consider all three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to separate the counting based on the number of digits. So, first, I can consider one-digit page numbers, then two-digit, and then three-digit. That might make it more manageable.\n\nLet's start with one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits are just 1 through 9, so each digit appears exactly once. So, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. So, in one-digit numbers, the count for both 4 and 8 is 1 each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each number has a tens place and a units place. I think I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9. So, for each tens digit, there are 10 numbers (0-9 in the units place). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, it's when the tens digit is 4, so that's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 8, which is 80-89, another 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times each.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: For each tens digit (1-9), the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, for each tens group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears once in each group. Since there are 9 tens groups (1-9), each digit appears 9 times in the units place. So, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but hold on, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, so 9 groups of 10. So, for each digit, in the units place, it's 9 times, right? So, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, adding up the tens and units places for two-digit numbers: 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each, so the difference is still zero.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is where it gets a bit more complicated because the number of three-digit numbers isn't a full hundred. So, I need to be careful here.\n\nLet me break down the three-digit numbers into their hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, let's consider each case.\n\nCase 1: Hundreds digit is 1 (100-199)\nCase 2: Hundreds digit is 2 (200-299)\nCase 3: Hundreds digit is 3 (300-399)\nCase 4: Hundreds digit is 4 (400-488)\n\nI'll need to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place (hundreds, tens, units) for each case.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place:\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears only when the hundreds digit is 4, which is in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place, well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor each case (hundreds digit 1, 2, 3, 4), I'll consider the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, the digit can be 0-9, so for each hundreds group, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, and each digit appears 10 times per hundreds group.\n\nSo, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the number of times a digit appears in the tens place depends on how many complete tens groups there are and any partial group in the case of 400-488.\n\nWait, but 400-488 isn't a complete hundreds group because it only goes up to 488, which is 88 numbers beyond 400. So, for the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place for 400-488, the tens digits are 0-8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because 488 is the last page, so the 8 in the tens place is only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. For each tens digit (0-7), there are 10 numbers each, but for 8, it's only 9 numbers because 488 is the end. So, for the tens place in 400-488, the digit 4 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449, so 10 numbers. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488, but that's only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for the 400-488 range.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to count the number of 4's and 8's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers. So, let's break it down:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each of these ranges (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has complete tens groups from 0-9. So, in each of these, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, now, adding up across all hundreds groups:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 3 hundreds groups * 10 = 30 for 4 and 30 for 8.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: 10 times for 4 and 9 times for 8.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4's = 30 + 10 = 40; 8's = 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me confirm.\n\nWait, 3 hundreds groups (1,2,3) each contribute 10 for 4 and 10 for 8 in the tens place. So, 3*10=30 for 4, and 3*10=30 for 8. Then, for the 400-488 range, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for tens place: 4's = 30 +10=40, 8's=30+9=39.\n\nOkay, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers.\n\nAgain, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\nStarting with hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each of these ranges has 100 numbers, so in each, for the units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times. So, in each of these hundreds groups, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Now, this range has 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, in each tens group (like 400-409, 410-419, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0-9. But since 488 is the last page, the last group is 480-488, which only goes up to 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, let's see: For each tens group from 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, each has 10 numbers, so in each, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 8 complete tens groups (400-409 up to 470-479), so that's 8 times where 4 appears in the units place. Then, in the last group, 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total for 4 in the units place in 400-488: 8 +1 =9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place in 400-488: Again, for each complete tens group (400-409, ..., 470-479), 8 appears once in the units place, so that's 8 times. In the last group, 480-488, 8 appears at 488, so that's one more time. So, total 8 +1=9 times.\n\nWait, but wait, in the last group, 480-488, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 8 appears only once, at 488. So, yes, 8 times from the complete tens groups and 1 time in the last group, totaling 9 times.\n\nSo, now, adding up the units place across all hundreds groups:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the units place. So, 3*10=30 for 4, and 3*10=30 for 8.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, total in the units place: 4's = 30 +9=39; 8's=30+9=39.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences for 4's and 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nIn the hundreds place: 4's =89, 8's=0.\n\nIn the tens place: 4's=40, 8's=39.\n\nIn the units place: 4's=39, 8's=39.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units) = 89 +40=129, 129+39=168.\n\n8's: 0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units) = 0+39=39, 39+39=78.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 4's appear 168 times, and 8's appear 78 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the page numbers from 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit.\n\nFrom 1-digit: 4's=1, 8's=1.\n\nFrom 2-digit: 4's=19, 8's=19.\n\nFrom 3-digit: 4's=168, 8's=78.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1+19+168 = 1+19=20, 20+168=188.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, I had 4's=168 and 8's=78. Then, adding the one-digit and two-digit:\n\n4's:1+19=20, 20+168=188.\n\n8's:1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me cross-verify.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers. Wait, in the hundreds place, for 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8, so 3*10=30 each. Then, for hundreds digit 4, tens place: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 30+10=40 for 4's and 30+9=39 for 8's. That's correct.\n\nIn the units place, for hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8, so 30 each. For hundreds digit 4: 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8, so 30+9=39 each. So, units place adds 39 for both.\n\nSo, 4's in three-digit:89+40+39=168.\n\n8's in three-digit:0+39+39=78.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I feel like 90 is a large difference, but maybe it's correct because 4 appears in the hundreds place a lot, whereas 8 doesn't appear at all in the hundreds place beyond 400-488, but even then, 8 appears only in the tens and units places in that range.\n\nWait, but let me think again: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times, which is a significant chunk. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 800-899 isn't included. So, that's a big factor in why 4's are more.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. The number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **One-Digit Page Numbers (1-9):**\n   - Both 4 and 8 appear once.\n   - Count: 4 (1), 8 (1)\n\n2. **Two-Digit Page Numbers (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:** Each digit (4 and 8) appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49 for 4, 80-89 for 8).\n   - **Units Place:** Each digit appears 9 times (once per ten's group, 9 groups).\n   - Total for two-digit numbers: 4 (10 + 9 = 19), 8 (10 + 9 = 19)\n\n3. **Three-Digit Page Numbers (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n     - 8 never appears.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds (100-399) and 10 times in 400-449, totaling 40.\n     - 8 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 480-488, totaling 39.\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39.\n     - 8 appears similarly 10 times in the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39.\n   - Total for three-digit numbers: 4 (89 + 40 + 39 = 168), 8 (0 + 39 + 39 = 78)\n\n4. **Total Counts Across All Page Numbers:**\n   - **4's:** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n   - **8's:** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out the difference.\n\nLet me start by understanding how digits are distributed in page numbers. Page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits, specifically up to 488. So, I need to consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nMaybe I should break it down by each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nWait, but actually, from 1 to 488, the number of times the units digit is 4 is 48 times, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, and the 49th would be at 484, which is within 488. Wait, no, 484 is the 49th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nLet me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as floor((N + 1) / 10). So, for N=488, it's floor(489/10) = 48.9, which is 48. So, 48 times. Hmm, but 484 is the 48th occurrence? Wait, 484 is 48*10 + 4, which would be the 49th occurrence because starting from 4, then 14, 24,...,484. So, maybe my formula is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is floor(N / 10) if we're not including N itself. Wait, maybe I should think differently. For each position, the number of times a digit d appears is calculated based on higher digits and lower digits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to break it down by each digit place separately.\n\nLet me try this approach for the units place:\n\n- For the units digit: The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in 488 numbers, how many full groups of 10 are there? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48 full groups, and then 8 remaining numbers. In each full group, the units digit is 4 once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so no 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, it's the same calculation. 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Let me check again. From 1 to 480, each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so that's one more 8. So, total 49. So, 8's in units place: 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place for digit 4:\n\n- The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers long, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nHow many such blocks are there? From 0 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit can be 0 (for pages 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488).\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- In the 0-99 range, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49: 10 numbers.\n- In 100-199, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149: 10 numbers.\n- Similarly, in 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers.\n- In 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers.\n- In 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers.\n\nSo, total number of times 4 appears in the tens place: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place:\n\n- It appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears in:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers.\n- 180-189: 10 numbers.\n- 280-289: 10 numbers.\n- 380-389: 10 numbers.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. For each hundred block, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears once every 100 numbers in the tens place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488.\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit is 8 once for 10 numbers. So, 4 full hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, 8's in tens place: 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place for digit 4:\n\n- The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-499, but our book ends at 488, so it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nFor digit 8 in the hundreds place:\n\n- The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, summarizing the counts:\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the units place for 4. Earlier, I thought it was 48, but when I considered 484 being the 48th occurrence, but actually, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nThe units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4, right? So, 484 is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because starting from 4 as the first occurrence, then 14 as the second, ..., 484 would be the 49th. But 488 is 48*10 + 8, so 484 is within 480-488, which is the 49th set. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor((N + 1) / 10). So, for N=488, it's (488 + 1) / 10 = 489 / 10 = 48.9, which floors to 48. So, 48 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place, it's floor((488 + 1)/10) = 48.9, which is 48, but since 488 is included, we have an extra 8 in the units place at 488, so total 49.\n\nWait, but using the formula, it's floor((N + 1)/10) for units digit. So, for 488, it's 48.9, which is 48, but since 488 ends with 8, we add 1, making it 49.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is floor((N + 1)/10) for the units digit. So, for 488, units digit 4: floor(489/10) = 48, and units digit 8: floor(489/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, we have 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nHmm, maybe I should adjust my earlier counts.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\n- 4's: 48\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place. 400 is the first, 401, 402,...,488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488, there are no pages with 800-899, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 89, but let me confirm once more.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nNumbers ending with 4: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence?\n\nThe nth term is 10n - 6. Wait, no, the nth term is 10n + 4? Wait, no, starting from 4, the nth term is 4 + 10(n-1). So, solving 4 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488.\n\nSo, 10(n-1) \u2264 484 => n-1 \u2264 48.4 => n \u2264 49.4. So, n=49. So, 49 times.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier count of 48. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, using the formula, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor((N + 1)/10). So, for N=488, it's floor(489/10) = 48. So, 48 times. But according to the sequence, it's 49 terms. Hmm, where's the discrepancy?\n\nWait, let's list the numbers ending with 4 up to 488:\n\n4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94,104,114,...,484.\n\nHow many terms is that? Let's see, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times.\n\nWait, so why does the formula give 48? Maybe the formula is floor(N/10). Let me check.\n\nIf I use floor(N/10), for N=488, it's 48.8, which is 48. But according to the sequence, it's 49. So, perhaps the correct formula is floor((N + 1)/10). Let's test:\n\nfloor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. So, that's 48, but the actual count is 49. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to the number of complete decades plus one if the last digit is >= d.\n\nWait, for example, if N=488, the last digit is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1. So, number of 4's in units place: floor(488/10) = 48, plus 1 because 8 >=4, so total 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and since last digit is 8, which is equal to 8, so add 1, total 49.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the formula is:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place from 1 to N:\n\n= floor(N / 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nSo, for d=4, N=488:\n\nfloor(488/10) = 48, and 488%10=8 >=4, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nfloor(488/10)=48, and 488%10=8 >=8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSo, earlier, I was wrong in counting 4's in units place as 48; it's actually 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, it's 49.\n\nWait, so that changes the counts. Let me recalculate.\n\nSo, correcting the units place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, I must have made a mistake earlier in the units place count.\n\nLet me double-check the units place again.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place = floor(488/10) + (1 if 8 >=4 else 0) = 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place = floor(488/10) + (1 if 8 >=8 else 0)=48 +1=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:\n\nUnits:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total=49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total=49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 89. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recount the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nFrom 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in hundreds place.\n\nTens place for 4's: 50 times.\n\nUnits place for 4's:49 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\nUnits:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total=98.\n\nSo, difference=188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count of units place for 4's.\n\nTherefore, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 blocks of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.\n\nEach block contributes 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nEach of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9 (since 488 is the last page). So, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 8's again. Since the book ends at 488, there are no pages with 800-899, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 89, but now with the corrected units place, it's 90.\n\nWait, let me check another way. Maybe by writing a small program or using another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the total number of digits printed.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to stick with the method I have.\n\nWait, so to recap:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's:49\n  - 8's:49\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's:50\n  - 8's:49\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's:89\n  - 8's:0\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). The formula `floor((N + 1) / 10)` gives 49 occurrences, as the last number (488) ends with 8, which is \u22654, adding 1 more occurrence.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n   **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. Using the same formula, there are 49 occurrences, as 488 ends with 8, adding 1 more.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no pages with 800-899, so 0 occurrences.\n\n   **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - The difference is 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** 90 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, let's start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to analyze the occurrence of the digits 4 and 8 in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears in a range of numbers, it's helpful to break it down by each digit position. So, I'll consider the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place individually for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - How many such numbers are there up to 488?\n   - Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449.\n   - How many such sets are there in 488 pages?\n   - From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so actually, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for pages 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488).\n   - For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Except maybe in the last hundred, which goes up to 488, so the tens digit goes up to 8, not 9. Wait, no, the tens digit in 400-488 can go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit in the 400-488 range is 0-8, meaning the digit 4 appears once in the tens place (440-449). So, let's calculate:\n     - For hundreds 0,1,2,3: Each contributes 10 times in the tens place. So that's 4 hundreds * 10 = 40.\n     - For the hundreds digit 4: The tens digit goes up to 8, so the digit 4 appears once (from 440-449). So, that's 10 times in the tens place? Wait, no, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so the tens digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 10 occurrences. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 times.\n     - Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 449 is included, right? So, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times in the 400-488 range as well.\n     - So total in the tens place: 4*10 (from 0-3 hundreds) + 10 (from 4 hundreds) = 50.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems off because from 0-399, each hundred has 10 occurrences in the tens place, so 4 hundreds (0,1,2,3) would be 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, but the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10. So total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, in the tens place for 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so digit 4 appears once in the tens place (440-449), which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 occurrences. So total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - In the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n   - From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 +89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times.\n\nIn the tens place, as calculated earlier, 50 times.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo total 4's: 48 +50 +89 = 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\nSimilarly, I'll break it down into units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488.\n   - How many such numbers are there up to 488?\n   - 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, because 8,18,...,488. Let's see: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? The nth term is 8 +10(n-1) \u2264488. So, 10(n-1) \u2264480 \u2192 n-1 \u226448 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, that's different from the 4's. So, units place for 8's: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488.\n   - Let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n   - For hundreds 0,1,2,3: Each contributes 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 hundreds *10=40.\n   - For the hundreds digit 4: The tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for the hundreds digit 4.\n   - So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 8's=49+49=98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 0-399, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 4 hundreds (0,1,2,3) contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the units place, I had 48. But when I counted the 8's in the units place, I had 49. That makes sense because 488 is included, so the 8 in the units place occurs one more time than the 4.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 4's had 50, and 8's had 49.\n\nHundreds place: 4's had 89, and 8's had 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 48 +50 +89=187\n\n8's:49 +49 +0=98\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times. That seems right.\n\nAnd for the tens place in 4's, I had 50, which includes the 40 from the first four hundreds and 10 from the 400-488 range. Wait, but in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, in the 400-488 range, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, yeah, the calculations seem correct. Therefore, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand the problem properly. Each page from 1 to 488 has a page number, and each digit of these numbers is printed. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears, and then find the difference between those two counts.\n\nI remember that when dealing with digit counting problems, it's often helpful to consider each digit position separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds, etc.\u2014and calculate the occurrences of the digit in each position.\n\nSo, the book has 488 pages, which means the page numbers go from 1 to 488. Let me note that the highest number is 488, which is a three-digit number. Therefore, I'll need to consider the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place.\n\nI'll start by calculating the number of times the digit 4 appears in each position and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to get the answer.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n1. Count the number of 4's in the units place.\n2. Count the number of 4's in the tens place.\n3. Count the number of 4's in the hundreds place.\n4. Do the same for the digit 8.\n5. Subtract the total 8's from total 4's.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n**Units Place:**\nIn the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Here, 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nSince the total number of pages is 488, I can divide 488 by 10 to find how many complete groups of 10 there are. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a group, I'll take the integer part, which is 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times.\n\nBut wait, the last group goes from 481 to 490, but our book ends at 488. So, in the units place, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 481 has 1, 482 has 2, up to 488 has 8. So, 4 appears in 484, which is within this incomplete group. Therefore, in the units place, there's one more 4 in the incomplete group. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, no, actually, 488 \u00f7 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, the number of complete groups is 48, each contributing one 4, and in the incomplete group (which has 8 numbers), does 4 appear? Let's see, the numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. Therefore, the incomplete group adds one more 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but when I think about it, 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 4 appears in each 10-number block. Since 488 is 48 full tens plus 8 more numbers. So, in each full ten, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times, and in the last 8 numbers, 481-488, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, total 49.\n\n**Tens Place:**\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99.\n\nIn each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for exactly 10 numbers: 40-49. So, in each 100-number block, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many complete 100-number blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete block, there are 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\nNow, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, 2 for 420-429, 3 for 430-439, 4 for 440-449, 5 for 450-459, 6 for 460-469, 7 for 470-479, and 8 for 480-488.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let me check: 488 - 400 = 88, so 401-488 is 88 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the partial block, we have 10 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 (from partial block) = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on. The partial block is 401-488, which is 88 numbers. The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, starting from 401, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8. So, in the partial block, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 10 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me check that. 400 is the first number with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8.\n\nI'll do the same process: count 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Units Place:**\nIn the units place, similar to 4's, each 10-number block has one 8. So, from 1-10, 8 appears once. So, total number of 8's in units place is the number of complete 10-number blocks plus any in the incomplete block.\n\nTotal pages: 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48.\n\nIn the incomplete block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. Therefore, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8. So, in the incomplete block, 488 is the only number with an 8 in the units place. So, yes, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n**Tens Place:**\nIn the tens place, 8 appears in the tens digit for numbers from 80-89 in each 100-number block. So, in each block of 100, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, how many complete 100-number blocks are there? 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\nNow, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, in the partial block, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 480 is included in the partial block, right? So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each 100-number block has 10 8's in the tens place, but in the partial block, it's only 9 because we stop at 488. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\nNow, the hundreds digit is 8 only in the block from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 49\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units, so +1, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the partial block, 440-449 contributes 10, so total 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers, 488 has an 8, so +1, total 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the partial block, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in tens place, so +9, total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as the book doesn't reach 800. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like 90 might be a lot. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me recount that.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place, in the partial block, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each 1, so 48, plus 484, so 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 full tens, each 1, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each 10, so 40, plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49.\n\nYes, that adds up to 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big number. Let me try a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nSuppose the book has 20 pages. Let's count 4's and 8's.\n\nPage numbers: 1-20.\n\n4's: Units place: 4,14 \u2192 2 times.\n\nTens place: 40-49, but we only go up to 20, so 0.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 2.\n\n8's: Units place: 8,18 \u2192 2 times.\n\nTens place: 0.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 2.\n\nDifference: 2 - 2 = 0.\n\nWait, but according to my method:\n\nUnits place for 4's: 20 \u00f7 10 = 2, so 2. Then, last group is 16-20, which is 5 numbers, but 16-20: units digits are 6,7,8,9,0. So, no additional 4's. So, total 4's in units: 2.\n\nTens place: 20 \u00f7 100 = 0.2, so 0 complete blocks, so 0. Then, in the partial block (1-20), the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is beyond 20, so 0. So, total 4's in tens: 0.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 2.\n\nSimilarly for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 20 \u00f7 10 = 2, so 2. Then, last group 16-20, which includes 18, so +1. So, total 3.\n\nWait, but in reality, from 1-20, the 8's are at 8 and 18, so 2 times. So, according to my method, I get 3, which is incorrect. Hmm, so maybe my method has a flaw.\n\nWait, let me see. When I did the units place for 8's in the 20-page example, I did 20 \u00f7 10 = 2, so 2 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 2. Then, the last group is 16-20, which has 18, so +1, total 3. But in reality, it's only 2.\n\nSo, the problem is that when I do the last group, I'm adding an extra 1 even when the last group doesn't complete a full 10. So, perhaps I need to adjust my method.\n\nWait, in the 20-page example, the last group is 16-20, which is 5 numbers. The units digit 8 appears only once in this group (18). So, I should check if the last group's units digit includes 8.\n\nSimilarly, in the 488-page example, the last group in units place is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, and 488 is included, so 8 appears once.\n\nBut in the 20-page example, the last group is 16-20, which includes 18, so 8 appears once, but the total 8's in units place should be 2 (8 and 18), but according to my method, it's 2 (from complete groups) +1 (from last group) = 3, which is wrong.\n\nSo, I think the issue is that when calculating the units place, the number of complete groups is floor(n/10), and then the remainder is n mod 10. If the remainder is >= the digit, then we add 1, else 0.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = n // 10\nif n % 10 >= d:\n    count +=1\nelse:\n    count +=0\n\nBut wait, that's not exactly correct. Because for digit d, in the units place, the number of times it appears is:\n\ncount = (n // 10) * 1\nplus, if the last partial group (n % 10) >= d, then +1, else 0.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. For example, in the 20-page example, n=20, d=8.\n\nn //10 = 2, so 2 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 2.\n\nn %10 = 0, which is less than 8, so no additional 8's. So, total 2, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the 488-page example, n=488, d=8.\n\nn//10 = 48, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48.\n\nn%10 = 8, which is equal to d=8, so we add 1. So, total 49, which is correct because 488 has an 8 in the units place.\n\nIn the 20-page example, n=20, d=8.\n\nn//10=2, n%10=0, which is less than 8, so total 2, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for d=4 in 20-page example:\n\nn=20, d=4.\n\nn//10=2, so 2.\n\nn%10=0, which is less than 4, so total 2, correct.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\ncount_units = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nBut wait, no. Because in the 488-page example, for d=4, n=488:\n\nn//10=48, n%10=8.\n\nSince 8 >=4, we add 1, so total 49, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8, n=488:\n\nn//10=48, n%10=8 >=8, so +1, total 49.\n\nIn the 20-page example, for d=8:\n\nn//10=2, n%10=0 <8, so total 2.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation for the 488-page book is correct.\n\nSo, returning to the original problem, total 4's: 188, total 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because 90 seems high, but my method seems to hold up when tested with smaller numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way.\n\nLet me consider that each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) can be treated separately, and for each place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position:\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >=4 else 0) = 48 +1=49.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >=8 else 0) = 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100) *10 + (if the last partial block's tens digit >=4, then the number of numbers from 40-49 in the last partial block, else 0).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place: (488 // 100) *10 + min(10, 488 % 100 - 40 +1) if 488 %100 >=40 else 0.\n\nWait, 488 //100 =4, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, 488%100=88.\n\nSo, 88 >=40, so min(10,88-40+1)=min(10,49)=10.\n\nSo, total 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nNumber of 8's in tens place: (488 //100)*10 + min(10,488%100 -80 +1) if 488%100 >=80 else 0.\n\n488//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\n488%100=88 >=80, so min(10,88-80+1)=min(10,9)=9.\n\nSo, total 40+9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: if 400<=488, then 488-400 +1=89.\n\nNumber of 8's: 0, since 800>488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand what the problem is asking. We're given a book with pages numbered from 1 to 488. Each page number is printed once, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After finding both counts, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nAlright, so the main task is to count the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me start by considering the digits separately, perhaps starting with the digit 4.\n\nI think the best approach is to consider each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately and calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nLet's start with the units place for the digit 4.\n\n**Counting 4's in the Units Place:**\n\nIn the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the digit 4 appears once (at page 4). Similarly, from 11 to 20, it appears once at page 14, and so on.\n\nSo, for every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488).\n\nIn each of these 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), we check if the units digit is 4. The numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Here, 484 has a units digit of 4, so that's one more occurrence.\n\nSo, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n**Counting 4's in the Tens Place:**\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40 to 49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, this happens in each hundred block. So, in 1-100, it's 40-49 (10 times). In 101-200, it's 140-149 (another 10 times). Similarly, in 201-300, it's 240-249, and in 301-400, it's 340-349.\n\nWait, but our book goes up to 488, so we need to check how many complete hundreds we have and if there's a partial hundred.\n\nFrom 1 to 400, we have four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these has a block where the tens digit is 4, so that's 10 times each, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me check: 401 to 488 includes 440-449, which is correct. So that's 10 more.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 1-400, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block contributes 10, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the next block where tens digit is 4 is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nBut wait, does 401-488 include 440-449? Yes, because 440 is greater than 401, and 449 is less than 488. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. From 1-400, each hundred has a 40-49 block, so that's 10 per hundred, times 4 hundreds, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Counting 4's in the Hundreds Place:**\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nWait, but wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only when the number is between 400 and 499. Since our book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, that's 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is the first number with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSo, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but 488 pages, so maybe that's correct, but let me verify.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. Because from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, we had 50, and in the units place, 49, so total 4's would be 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me see: 488 pages, so the total number of digits is 3 \u00d7 488 = 1464 digits, but we're only counting 4's and 8's, so 188 4's is plausible.\n\nNow, let's move on to counting the 8's.\n\n**Counting 8's in the Units Place:**\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, it appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, it's at 8; 11-20 at 18, and so on.\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10 in 488 is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). So, each block contributes one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 times.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more.\n\nSo, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 488 is included, so yes, that's correct.\n\n**Counting 8's in the Tens Place:**\n\nNow, for the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488.\n\nSo, each complete hundred block contributes 10 times in the tens place for 8. So, from 1-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, which is 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\nNow, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488), so that's 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-489 is the next block, but we only go up to 488, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n**Counting 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, the count here is 0.\n\nSo, total 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, total 8's are 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, we subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me verify the counts again:\n\n**For 4's:**\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades \u00d7 1 = 48, plus one more in 484, so 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 10 in 440-449, so 50.\n- Hundreds place: 89 numbers from 400-488, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**For 8's:**\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades \u00d7 1 = 48, plus one in 488, so 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, so 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me think if I missed anything.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 8's, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. That's correct because 488 is included, and 480 is the first one.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 488 is included, so that's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 4's, we had 40 from 1-400 and 10 from 440-449, which is correct because 440-449 is within 401-488.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 occurrences, so 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, and then one more in 484, so 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then one in 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, and then 9 in 480-488, so 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because I feel like the difference might be higher, but maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, hundreds place is 0, correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when counting the tens place for 8's, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences, which is correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write down the counts for each digit position separately.\n\nLet me try that.\n\n**Units Place:**\n\nFor 4's: every 10 numbers, so total number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10) + (1 if the last partial block has a 4 in units place).\n\nWait, floor(488/10) = 48, and 488 mod 10 = 8, which is less than 4, so no additional 4 in the units place beyond the 48 blocks. Wait, but earlier I thought 484 was in the last partial block, which is 481-488, so 484 is included, so that's an extra 4.\n\nWait, maybe my initial approach was wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when using the formula, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + (1 if the units digit of n is >= d else 0). Wait, but that might not be accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate it as:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place = number of complete decades \u00d7 1 + (1 if the last partial decade includes a 4).\n\nSo, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4, so 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n\nNow, in the last partial decade, which is 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does this include a 4? Yes, at 484. So, that's one more, so total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place:\n\nNumber of complete decades: 48, each contributing one 8, so 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n\nIn the last partial decade, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more, so total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n\nFor 4's in the tens place:\n\nEach hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49, 10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, 101-200: 140-149, another 10.\n\n201-300: 240-249, another 10.\n\n301-400: 340-349, another 10.\n\nSo, that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\nNow, from 401-488, the next block where the tens digit is 4 is 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more, so total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nEach hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\nFrom 401-488, the next block where the tens digit is 8 is 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n\nFor 4's: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nFor 8's: from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so no 8's in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me think again if I made any mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for 8's, since 800 is beyond 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n### Counting 4's\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every block of 10 numbers contributes one 4.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The last partial block (481-488) includes 484, adding one more.\n   - Total: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred block (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.) contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), contributing \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\).\n   - The next block (440-449) contributes 10 more.\n   - Total: \\(40 + 10 = 50\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Numbers 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\).\n\n### Counting 8's\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every block of 10 numbers contributes one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The last partial block (481-488) includes 488, adding one more.\n   - Total: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred block (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), contributing \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\).\n   - The next block (480-488) contributes 9 more.\n   - Total: \\(40 + 9 = 49\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - There are no numbers from 800-899, so no occurrences.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\).\n\n### Difference\nThe number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by:\n\\[ 188 - 98 = 90 \\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that each page is numbered from 1 to 488, and each number is printed once. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, so let's start by considering how numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I'll need to analyze the digits in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the problem into three parts: counting the number of 4's and 8's in the units place, then in the tens place, and finally in the hundreds place.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten consecutive numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once in the units place every ten numbers.\n\nSo, for the units place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, every block of ten numbers will have exactly one 4 in the units place. Similarly, the same goes for 8.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of ten and then an additional 8 pages. So, in each block of ten, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Therefore, for 48 complete blocks, that's 48 times each for 4 and 8. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the 488th page. Wait, actually, the last page is 488, so the units digits in the last partial block are 1 (481), 2 (482), ..., up to 8 (488). So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding that to the previous count, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but that can't be right because 488 is included, so maybe I need to double-check.\n\nWait, actually, each complete block of ten contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 488 pages, the number of complete blocks is 48, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the remaining 8 pages (since 488 = 48*10 + 8) will have units digits from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so they are equal in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For each block of ten, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., each has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 blocks would give 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49, 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, same number in units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, etc., up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place each hundred.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. Wait, no, 488 is 4*100 + 88, so it's 4 full hundreds and then 88 pages. So, for each of the first 400 pages, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488) will have their tens digits from 0 to 8. Let's break this down. From 401-410, the tens digit is 0. From 411-420, it's 1, and so on, up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear in the remaining 88 pages? Let's see, the tens digit cycles every 10 pages. So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, for the tens digit 4, that would be in the block 441-450, but wait, 441-450 is within 401-488? Wait, 441 is 441, which is within 401-488, and 450 is also within. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, let me confirm. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 pages (481-488), so 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 (from first 400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48.\n\nWait, but hold on, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is only present in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, 48 times in total for 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, 8 more times. So, 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place: 400 pages contribute 40, and the remaining 88 pages contribute 10, so 50.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case, since the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nTotal hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place for 8's was 49, tens place 48, so 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 97.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so subtract 97 from 188: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97. Correct.\n\n188 - 97 = 91. So, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the counts.\n\nLet me go through each place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nEach block of ten has one 4 and one 8. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8. So, 48 each. Then, the last partial block is 8 pages: 481-488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFirst 400 pages: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for each. Then, the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digits go from 0 to 8. The tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's: 40 +8=48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference: 188-97=91.\n\nSo, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula or a more systematic method to ensure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a number with n digits, each digit position can be considered separately.\n\nIn this case, since the maximum page number is 488, we can consider all numbers as three-digit numbers by padding with leading zeros, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, we can think of each number as having up to three digits and analyze each position accordingly.\n\nBut I think the method I used earlier is correct. Let me just verify the counts once more.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 488 pages, each ten has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- 48 full tens: 48 each.\n- Last 8 pages: 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each once.\n- Total: 48 +1=49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- 400 pages: 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 each.\n- Remaining 88 pages: 401-488.\n  - Tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450: 10 times.\n  - Tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488: 8 times.\n- Total: 40+10=50 for 4, 40+8=48 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488: 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place: 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of ten numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 full blocks (480 pages) contribute 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes ten 4's and ten 8's in the tens place.\n   - 400 pages contribute 40 each.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) contribute ten 4's (441-450) and eight 8's (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the structure of page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I can analyze each digit position individually. So, I'll handle the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10. But since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. So, 48 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\n   Let's see, the first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks would give 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, does the last block go up to 449? Since 488 is beyond 449, the tens place 4 in 440-449 is fully included. So, yes, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding these up for digit 4: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. Tens place: Each hundred has one block of 10, so 4 hundreds (0-9, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks for the tens place, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, in the last block, 400-488, the tens place is 4 only up to 449, right? Because from 450 onwards, the tens digit is 5, 6, etc. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's included in the 5 blocks. So, 50 is correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total for 4 is 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, 48+50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems right.\n\nNow, let's do the same for digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so does that add another 8? Let's see: 488 has an 8 in the units place, so yes, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, the last block is 480-489, but the book only goes up to 488. So, in the tens place, how many times does 8 appear?\n\n   Let's count the blocks:\n\n   - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n   - 180-189: another 10.\n   - 280-289: another 10.\n   - 380-389: another 10.\n   - 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times.\n\n   So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding these up for digit 8: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 187, total 8's:97.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 488 /10 =48.8 \u2192 48 times.\n- Tens: Each hundred has one block of 10, so 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Each block contributes 10, so 5*10=50. But in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only up to 449, which is 10 numbers, so included in the 5 blocks. So, 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:48+50+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 488/10=48.8 \u219248 times, but 488 has an 8, so 48 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, actually, 488 is 48*10 +8, so the units digit 8 appears 49 times? Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10. So, the number of times 8 appears in units place is floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, we add 1, making it 49 times.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I thought it was 48, but actually, it's 49.\n\nBecause for units digit, the count is floor((n + d)/10), where d is the digit. Wait, maybe a better way is:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place from 1 to n is:\n\nIf n >= d, then floor((n - d)/10) +1.\n\nWait, let me test with n=8: from 1-8, 8 appears once.\n\nUsing formula: floor((8-8)/10)+1=0+1=1. Correct.\n\nn=18: units digit 8 appears at 8,18: 2 times.\n\nfloor((18-8)/10)+1=1+1=2. Correct.\n\nn=488: floor((488-8)/10)+1= floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, units digit 8 appears 49 times, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 4 in units place: floor((488-4)/10)+1= floor(484/10)+1=48+1=49? Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Wait, let's check:\n\nn=488, d=4.\n\nfloor((488-4)/10)+1= floor(484/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nBut wait, when I first thought, I said 48. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's list the numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms?\n\nThe sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The difference is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nYes, so units digit 4 appears 49 times, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, so earlier I made a mistake. For digit 4, units place is 49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8, units place is 49.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought units place for 4 was 48, and for 8 was 48. But according to this formula, both are 49.\n\nSo, I need to correct that.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n- Tens place: 5 blocks of 10, so 50 times.\n- Hundreds place: 89 times.\nTotal: 49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, 49+50=99, plus 89=188.\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n- Tens place: 49 times (as calculated earlier: 10+10+10+10+9=49).\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\nTotal:49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, now, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the difference is still 90. But I need to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the units place.\n\nWait, let me verify with a smaller number to see if the formula works.\n\nSuppose n=14.\n\nDigit 4 in units place: 4,14 \u2192 2 times.\n\nUsing formula: floor((14-4)/10)+1= floor(10/10)+1=1+1=2. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, digit 8 in units place up to 14: only 8, so 1 time.\n\nFormula: floor((14-8)/10)+1= floor(6/10)+1=0+1=1. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, in the case of n=488:\n\n- Units digit 4:49 times.\n- Units digit 8:49 times.\n\nSo, earlier, I had miscalculated the units digit for 4 as 48, but it's actually 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, let's check digit 4:\n\nFrom 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times.\n\nBut wait, in the last block, 440-449, that's 10 numbers, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is fully included. So, 50 is correct.\n\nFor digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nFrom 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, total for 8's:49+49=98.\n\nTotal for 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, but I had to correct the units place from 48 to 49 for digit 4, which increased the total 4's by 1, making the difference still 90.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nOriginal calculation:\n\n4's:48+50+89=187\n\n8's:48+49=97\n\nDifference:187-97=90.\n\nAfter correction:\n\n4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the difference remains 90.\n\nWait, but in the initial calculation, I had 4's as 187 and 8's as 97, difference 90.\n\nAfter correction, 4's=188, 8's=98, difference 90.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything in the hundreds place for digit 8. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 is correct.\n\nAnd for digit 4, hundreds place is 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nSo, yes, 89.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this occurs 49 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n- **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this occurs 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full blocks and a partial block from 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand what exactly is being asked. The problem says each page number is printed once, starting from 1 and ending at 488. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nSo, the plan is to calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference. I remember that when counting digits in numbers, it's helpful to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits, so I'll need to consider each place (units, tens, hundreds) for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place one by one.\n\n1. **Units place:** In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on.\n\n   Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll take the integer part, which is 48 full blocks. Each block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 fours. But wait, after 480, the next block is 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, we don't go all the way to 490. However, in the units place, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once in 484. So, actually, the units place in 481-488 contributes one more 4. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from the full blocks) plus 1 (from the partial block), totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, moving on to the tens place. Here, the digit 4 appears in a sequence of 10 numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, each occurrence of 4 in the tens place contributes 10 fours. \n\n   To find how many times this happens, we can look at how many full sets of 100 there are in 488. The hundreds digit goes up to 4, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\n   In each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 exactly once, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place.\n\n   So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so there are 5 blocks where the tens digit is 4. Each contributes 10 fours, so that's 5 * 10 = 50 fours.\n\n   Wait, but in the last block, 440-449, we have 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 488, right? Because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, all 10 fours are included. So, total 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\n   Wait, let me check that. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\n   As before, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. Then, in the partial block from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** For the tens place, 8 appears in a block of 10 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 eights in the tens place.\n\n   How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see:\n\n   - 0-99: 80-89 (10 eights)\n   - 100-199: 180-189 (10 eights)\n   - 200-299: 280-289 (10 eights)\n   - 300-399: 380-389 (10 eights)\n   - 400-488: 480-488 (9 eights because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 has 8 in tens place, 481 has 8, etc., up to 488. So that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place.\n\n   Wait, but earlier when we had 4's in the tens place, we had 5 blocks each contributing 10 fours, but here, in the hundreds place, the last block only contributes 9 eights. So, let's calculate:\n\n   From 0-488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so we have:\n\n   - 0-99: 80-89 (10 eights)\n   - 100-199: 180-189 (10 eights)\n   - 200-299: 280-289 (10 eights)\n   - 300-399: 380-389 (10 eights)\n   - 400-488: 480-488 (9 eights)\n\n   So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\n   Wait, that's correct because 488 is less than 800, so the hundreds digit never is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nNow, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. For 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488. How many numbers is that? 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 9 eights. So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) and 1 block of 9 (from 480-488), totaling 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nWait, but earlier for fours, I had 188 fours. So, the difference would be 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nLet me recount the fours:\n\n- Units place: 49 fours. Because from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place, and in the last partial block, 481-488, the 4 appears once at 484. So, 48 full blocks (48*1=48) plus 1=49.\n\n- Tens place: 5 blocks where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for eights:\n\n- Units place: 49 eights. Because 48 full blocks (48*1=48) plus 1 in the last partial block at 488.\n\n- Tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus the 480-488 contributing 9, so 40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference: 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for eights, the hundreds place is 0, which is correct because the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo, the calculations seem correct, leading to 188 fours and 98 eights, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula or a different counting method to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a number up to N=488, the count of digit d in position k can be calculated using a formula, but I think the way I did it before is correct.\n\nWait, another way: For each digit place, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- For units place, as before, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total number of fours in units place is floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then check the remainder: 488 mod 10=8, so in the last partial cycle, 481-488, 4 appears once (at 484). So, 48+1=49 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in units place: same logic, 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and in the last partial cycle, 488 is included, so 48+1=49 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for eights, the units place would be 49, but in fours, it's also 49. Wait, but in fours, the units place was 49, and in eights, it's also 49. But earlier, I thought that in fours, units place was 49, and in eights, units place was 49. But in my previous calculation, I had 49 fours and 49 eights in the units place, but when I added up, I had 188 fours and 98 eights. Wait, that seems inconsistent because if both units places are 49, then why is the total fours higher?\n\nWait, no, because fours also appear in tens and hundreds places, while eights only appear in units and tens. So, the fours have more contributions from other places, leading to a higher total.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\n- Fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188.\n\n- Eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. I had 5 blocks of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, I had 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, so 49.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, for fours, it's 89, which is correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers.\n\nI think the calculations are correct, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nAnd for eights, the hundreds place is 0 because the book doesn't go beyond 488, so no number has 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, so I think the final answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I'll need to analyze how often the digits 4 and 8 appear in each position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately.\n\n**1. Units Place:**\n\nIn the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1 through 0. Then from 11 to 20, it's 1 through 0 again, and so on.\n\nI need to find how many times 4 appears in the units place and how many times 8 appears.\n\nFor 4 in the units place:\n- Every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484).\n- Since the book has 488 pages, the last block is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last 4 in the units place is 484.\n\nSo, how many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing by 10 gives 48 full blocks (since 48*10=480) and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each full block, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no additional 4 in the units place.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nFor 8 in the units place:\n- Similarly, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 8 in the units place (like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488).\n- The last number is 488, so that's included.\n\nNumber of full blocks: 48, each contributing one 8. In the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 8 is present in 488, so that's one more.\n\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that. The last block is 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so the units digits in 481-488 are 1-8. So, only 488 has an 8 in the units place, which is one. So, total 8's in units place: 48 (from full blocks) + 1 (from 488) = 49. That seems correct.\n\n**2. Tens Place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Here, each digit appears in the tens place for a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digits go from 0-9, each appearing 10 times. Then from 100-199, the tens digits again cycle through 0-9, each appearing 10 times, and so on.\n\nLet me calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFor 4 in the tens place:\n- The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n- Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449, which is within 488. So, how many such ranges are there?\n\nFrom 0-488, the ranges where tens digit is 4 are:\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nSo that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, total 4's in tens place: 50.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place:\n- Similarly, the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.\n- But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), not 10.\n\nSo, let's calculate:\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 (since 489 is beyond 488)\n\nSo total 8's in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40, and then 480-488 is 9, so total 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\n**3. Hundreds Place:**\n\nNow, the hundreds place. This is for numbers from 100 to 999, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nLet's find how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 4 in the hundreds place:\n- Numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n- How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8 in the hundreds place:\n- Numbers from 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**4. Total Count:**\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**5. Difference:**\n\nNow, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find how many more 4's there are.\n\nDifference = Total 4's - Total 8's = 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n- Units place for 4: 48 times. That seems correct because every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and the last 8 numbers don't add another 4 in units place.\n\n- Units place for 8: 49 times. Because 48 full blocks (each contributing one 8) plus one more in 488. That seems right.\n\n- Tens place for 4: 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Tens place for 8: 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place for 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place for 8: 0, since the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 48+50+89=187 for 4's, and 49+49=98 for 8's.\n\nDifference: 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but 89 seems a bit high. Let me think again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, which is correct because each of the five ranges (40-49, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nSimilarly, 8 in the tens place: four full ranges (80-89, etc.) contribute 40, and then 480-488 is 9, so 49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 for 4 and 49 for 8. That's correct because 488 includes an extra 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, adding up, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I included all the ranges correctly.\n\nFor the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's five ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 for 4, 49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8. Correct.\n\nSo, the total is indeed 187 for 4's and 98 for 8's, so 89 more 4's.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Answer:** The number of additional 4's printed compared to 8's is \\boxed{89}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably think about how page numbers are structured. Each page number is a three-digit number, right? From 1 to 488. Wait, actually, page 1 is just one digit, page 10 is two digits, and from 100 onwards, they're three digits. So maybe I should consider the digits in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all page numbers and how many times 8 appears. Then, subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles through 0 to 9. So, for example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. But wait, in the first 10 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 0, so 0 isn't included in the first set. Hmm, maybe I should adjust for that.\n\nWait, actually, starting from page 1, the units digits go from 1 to 9 in the first 9 pages, and then page 10 has a units digit of 0. So maybe for each set of 10 pages, the units digits cycle through 0-9, but starting from 1. Hmm, maybe it's better to think of it as every 10 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly once in the units place. But since the first page is 1, not 0, maybe the first set is 1-10, where units digits are 1-0, and then 11-20 would have 1-0 again, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as the number of times each digit appears in each position. Let me think for the units place first.\n\nTotal number of pages is 488. So, the number of complete groups of 10 pages is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 groups with 8 pages remaining. So, each complete group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 groups would contribute 48 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 pages (from 481 to 488) would have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in these remaining pages, the digit 4 appears once (at page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at page 488). So, in the units place, total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, the count of 4's and 8's in the units place is the same. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. Then it repeats.\n\nSo, in each 100 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for the digit 4, that's 10 times, and for 8, that's 10 times in each 100 pages.\n\nNow, the total number of pages is 488, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nSo, in each of the 4 hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. So, 4 hundreds would contribute 4*10 = 40 4's and 4*10 = 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) would have tens digits from 0 to 8. Let me see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the last group is only 481-488, which is 8 pages.\n\nSo, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages. But wait, in the 401-488 range, how many full tens are there?\n\nWait, 401-410: tens digit 0\n\n411-420: 1\n\n421-430: 2\n\n431-440: 3\n\n441-450: 4\n\n451-460:5\n\n461-470:6\n\n471-480:7\n\n481-488:8\n\nSo, each of these tens digits from 0 to 8 occurs exactly 10 times except the last one, which is only 8 pages.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages. So that's 10 times.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the tens place, it occurs in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times\n- 8 appears 8 times\n\nTherefore, in the tens place overall:\n\n- 4's: 4*10 (from the hundreds) + 10 (from the remaining 88 pages) = 50\n- 8's: 4*10 (from the hundreds) + 8 (from the remaining 88 pages) = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 48. So, 4's are 2 more than 8's here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the digit in the hundreds place is 4 only from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1,2,3, or 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, 4's are 89 more than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 48\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the units place, I calculated 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nIn the tens place, 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188\n\n8's: 49 + 48 = 97; 97 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again if I counted correctly in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 groups, with 8 pages remaining.\n\nEach group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each.\n\nRemaining 8 pages: 481-488, units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48+1=49 for 4's and 48+1=49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach 100 pages contribute 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nThere are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 each.\n\nRemaining 88 pages (401-488):\n\nTens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, 4 in the tens place occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, 10 4's.\n\n8 in the tens place occurs in 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, 8 8's.\n\nSo, total tens place: 40+10=50 4's and 40+8=48 8's.\n\nCorrect.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 4's.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 complete groups of 10 pages contribute 48 each.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n   - Total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 pages contribute 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488) contribute 10 4's and 8 8's.\n   - Total: 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand how page numbers are structured. Each page has a number from 1 to 488. So, each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. The digits we're interested in are 4 and 8. I need to count how many times each of these digits appears in all the page numbers and then find the difference.\n\nMaybe I can approach this by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Since page numbers go up to 488, the hundreds place can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, page numbers start from 1, so the hundreds place will be 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, and so on up to 4 for 400-488.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\n**Units Place:**\nFor the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nWell, for each group of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0-9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, plus any extra numbers beyond that.\n\nLet me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10 and 8 extra numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place. Now, for the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digits 1-8 each appear once more in the units place, and 9 and 0 don't appear in this extra part.\n\nSo, for the digit 4: it appears 48 times in the units place from the complete groups, plus 1 more time in the extra numbers (484). So total 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8: it appears 48 times in the units place from the complete groups, plus 1 more time in the extra numbers (488). So total 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check that. The extra numbers are 481-488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, 4 and 8 each appear once more. So, units place gives 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\n**Tens Place:**\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each group of 100.\n\nSo, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 100 are there? There are 4 complete groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial group from 401-488.\n\nEach complete group contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, for each digit, that's 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, the partial group is 401-488, which is 88 numbers. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, each digit from 0-8 appears in the tens place a certain number of times.\n\nWait, let me think. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nEach of these blocks is 10 numbers except the last one, which is 8 numbers (481-488). So, for each tens digit from 0-7, it appears 10 times, and for 8, it appears 8 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place in the partial group:\n\n- 0: 10\n- 1: 10\n- 2: 10\n- 3: 10\n- 4: 10\n- 5: 10\n- 6: 10\n- 7: 10\n- 8: 8\n\nNow, let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in the partial group.\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, adding this to the complete groups:\n\n- For 4: 40 (from complete groups) + 10 (from partial) = 50\n- For 8: 40 (from complete groups) + 8 (from partial) = 48\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check that. Each complete group contributes 10 times per digit, so 4 groups give 40 times for each digit. Then, in the partial group, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n- 4: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\nNow, the hundreds place. Each page number from 1-99 has a hundreds digit of 0, so they don't contribute to the hundreds place count. Pages 100-199 have a hundreds digit of 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only for pages 400-488. Let's find out how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 400-488, there are 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place contributions:\n\n- 4: 89\n- 8: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, that seems off because 188 - 97 = 91, which is a big difference. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the units place. Earlier, I thought that each digit appears 48 times in the units place from the complete groups, plus once more for 4 and 8 in the extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8 in the units place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, I had 50, and for 8's, 48. Let me check that again.\n\nIn the tens place, each complete group (1-100, etc.) contributes 10 times for each digit. So, 4 groups give 40 times each. Then, in the partial group (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me double-check each part.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place. Let me think again. The total number of units digits is 488 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place except possibly for the last partial group.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, and 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each complete group, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place, so 48 times each. Then, in the extra 8 numbers, the units digits are 1-8, so each of these digits appears once more. So, digits 1-8 each appear 48 + 1 = 49 times, and digits 9 and 0 appear 48 times each.\n\nSo, yes, 4 and 8 each appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nIn the tens place, each complete group of 100 contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 complete groups (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 times each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times. So, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times in the tens place of the partial group.\n\nSo, total for 4's tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n\nTotal for 8's tens place: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using a formula or a different counting method to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about each digit place separately and count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nAnother way is to consider that for each digit place, the count of a particular digit can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor units place:\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if d <= (N mod 10) else 0).\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\nIt's floor((N)/100) * 10 + extra counts in the partial group.\n\nBut maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, I can use the method I used before.\n\nWait, another thought: when I calculated the hundreds place, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers. Let me confirm that: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's.\n\nFor 8's, since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place, 0 8's.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times.\n\nIn the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised by the large difference. Let me see if I can think of another way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately and then add them up.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: As before, 49 times.\n- Tens place: 50 times.\n- Hundreds place: 89 times.\nTotal: 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n- Tens place: 48 times.\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\nTotal: 97.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place from pages 1 to 480.\n- Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n- Total 4's: 49, Total 8's: 49.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit appears 40 times in the tens place from pages 1-400.\n- Pages 401-488 contribute 10 more 4's and 8 more 8's.\n- Total 4's: 50, Total 8's: 48.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n- No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n- Total 4's: 89, Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\nSo, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since page numbers go up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit starts at 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, and so on up to 4 for 400-488.\n\nI'll tackle each digit place one by one, starting with the units place. \n\n**Units Place:**\n\nFor the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So in each set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. \n\nTo find out how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide the total number of pages by 10 and then see how many complete sets of 10 there are. But wait, since 488 isn't a multiple of 10, I'll have to adjust for the remaining pages.\n\nNumber of complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets. Each set contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 each.\n\nBut wait, the last partial set is from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. In this partial set, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these, the units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because each complete set contributes one 4 and one 8, so 48 sets give 48 each, and the last partial set adds one more 4 and one more 8. So, total units digits: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n\nNow, moving to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for example, in 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly for 8 in 80-89, another 10 times.\n\nBut wait, the book has 488 pages, so we have four complete hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, no, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds go up to 400-488.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Each hundred block is 100 pages, so from 1-100, 101-200, etc., up to 401-500, but since we stop at 488, the last block is only 88 pages (401-488). Hmm, but for the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 4 in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, and same for 8.\n\nSo, how many complete hundreds do we have? From 1-400, that's four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights.\n\nNow, the last partial hundred is 401-488, which is 88 pages. In the tens place, the digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit in 401-488 goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs once in 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's a full set. Wait, no, 401-488 includes 401-488, so the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but only up to 488). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and the digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, but 480-489 is 10 pages, but we only have up to 488, so 9 pages. Hmm, so in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nWait, but let me check: from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but only up to 488). So, for the tens digit:\n\n- 0: 401-410 (10 pages)\n- 1: 411-420 (10)\n- 2: 421-430 (10)\n- 3: 431-440 (10)\n- 4: 441-450 (10)\nWait, no, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, 440-449 is 10 pages where the tens digit is 4.\n\nSimilarly, 480-488 is 9 pages where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, in the last partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total tens digits:\n\n- Fours: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 10 in the last partial hundred, so 50.\n- Eights: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last partial hundred, so 49.\n\nWait, but wait, each hundred block from 1-100, 101-200, etc., up to 301-400, each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40 each. Then, the last block (401-488) adds 10 fours and 9 eights. So, total fours in tens place: 40 +10=50, eights:40 +9=49.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n\nNow, the hundreds digit. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no contribution. From 100-199, it's 1, so no 4's or 8's. From 200-299, it's 2; same, no 4's or 8's. From 300-399, it's 3; same. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nSimilarly, does 8 ever appear in the hundreds place? The book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, never 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total hundreds place:\n\n- Fours: 89\n- Eights: 0\n\n**Now, let's sum up all the digits:**\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 +89 = 188\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights: 49 +49 +0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is fours minus eights: 188 -98 =90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- Each set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete sets in 480 pages, contributing 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488), so total units: 48+1=49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights. Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 4\u00d710=40 each. The last partial hundred (401-488) contributes 10 fours (440-449) and 9 eights (480-488). So, tens: 40+10=50 fours, 40+9=49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- From 400-488, 89 fours. No eights.\n\nSo, totals:\n\nFours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nEights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for the last partial hundred. Let me check again.\n\nIn the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's from 440-449, which is 10 pages. For 8 in the tens place, it's from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8 (as in 480-488). So, yes, 480-488 is 9 pages, contributing 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, the counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 90.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, how many pages is that? 488 -400 +1=89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages, so 89 fours. That's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- 48 complete sets (480 pages) contribute 48 each.\n- Last 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 and one 8.\n- Total: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights.\n- Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n- Last partial hundred (401-488) contributes 10 fours (440-449) and 9 eights (480-488).\n- Total: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n- No eights in the hundreds place.\n- Total: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours.\n\nThe answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I guess I should consider each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds\u2014because the number of times a digit appears can vary depending on the place. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 each appear once in the units place. So from page 1 to page 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each of these 48 sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 doesn't appear again. So total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, in each set of 10, 8 appears once. So again, 48 times. Plus, in the last 8 pages, 8 appears once at page 488. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, hold on. The last 8 pages are 481 to 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So 8 appears once at page 488. So yes, 48 + 1 = 49. So units place: 48 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 pages. So for example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds and then 88 pages. \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 times 10 is 40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, from 401 to 409, the tens digit is 0, so 4 doesn't appear. From 410 to 419, tens digit is 1, so no. Similarly, 420-429: tens digit 2, no. 430-439: tens digit 3, no. 440-449: tens digit 4, so that's 10 times. Then 450-459: 5, 460-469:6, 470-479:7, 480-488:8. So in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (from 440-449). So total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: in each complete hundred, 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 times 10 is 40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 480 is included, but 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for each of these, so 9 times. So total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. For the hundreds digit, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place for 100 pages each. So 1 appears from 1-99, 2 from 100-199, 3 from 200-299, and 4 from 300-399, 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is 89 pages, not 100.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, and 4 for 300-399 and 400-488. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 300-399, that's 100 pages, so 4 appears 100 times. Then from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So total 4's in hundreds place: 100 + 89 = 189.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 3 for pages 300-399, which is 100 pages. Then 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So total 4's in hundreds place: 89 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because from 300-399, the hundreds digit is 3, not 4. So 4 appears in the hundreds place only from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the hundreds place: does 8 ever appear in the hundreds place? The book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So 0 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: pages 1-99: hundreds digit 0 or 1? Wait, no, page numbers are from 1 to 488. So pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since they are two-digit numbers), but in terms of hundreds place, it's 0. So the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0 times.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, units place for 4: every 10 pages, 4 appears once. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 8: same as 4, but in the last partial set, 488 is included, so 49 times. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4: Each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place. 4 hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more. Total 50. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8: Each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place. 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So 9 more, total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4: Only from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8: Never, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I was calculating the hundreds place for 4, I considered 400-488 as 89 pages. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So yes, correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4. Let me think: pages 400-488: that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me think: when I was calculating the tens place for 4, I considered 440-449 as 10 pages, so 10 fours. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in tens place, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 eights. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 89. So the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488, and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. So, I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI'll approach this by looking at each digit place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - To find out how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide the total number of pages by 10. But since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, I should check if 488 is included. The last number with a 4 in the units place before 488 is 484, which is 484. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For the tens place, 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times. For example, from 40 to 49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, from 140 to 149, and so on.\n   - Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the second is 140-149 (another 10), the third is 240-249 (another 10), and the fourth is 340-349 (another 10). Now, the next block would be 440-449, which is also 10 numbers. After that, the next block would start at 540, but since our book ends at 488, we don't have a complete block there. So, how many complete blocks are there?\n   - From 40-49: 10\n   - 140-149: 10\n   - 240-249: 10\n   - 340-349: 10\n   - 440-449: 10\n   - That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems right.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 itself have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is included, so that would be the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is the 488th page, so the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 is 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, and then the 488th page adds another 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For the tens place, 8 appears in blocks of 100 numbers. Each block has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is only up to 488.\n   - Let's count the complete blocks:\n     - 80-89: 10\n     - 180-189: 10\n     - 280-289: 10\n     - 380-389: 10\n     - 480-488: 9 (since 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n   - So, that's 4 complete blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the occurrences of 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the units place, I thought 488 is the 48th group, but 488 is the 488th page, so the units digit cycles every 10. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? It's the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, plus 1 if the last digit is 8. Since 488 ends with 8, so yes, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nIn the tens place, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, we have 400/100 = 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 187 and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98.\n\nLet me calculate that: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's.\n\nUnits place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers is that? Let's see, 484 is the last one before 488. So, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 / 10 = 48.4, so 48 full times. So, 48 times.\n\nTens place: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, and then 488 is the 49th. So, 49 times.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, 49 +49=98.\n\nDifference: 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1=89 pages. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nAnother way to think about the hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 4's, I had 5 blocks, each of 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48.\n\nSo, 48+50+89=187.\n\nFor 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98.\n\n187-98=89.\n\nHmm, seems correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, so 9 times the digit 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: total number of 8's in the tens place is 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 89.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full groups).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times (5 blocks \u00d7 10).\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full groups + 1 for 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times (4 full blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 for 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **89**.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem clearly. Each page from 1 to 488 is printed once, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then compare that to how many times the digit 8 appears. The difference between these two counts will be my answer.\n\nAlright, so maybe I should break this down by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. That way, I can count how many 4's and 8's appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages, plus any extra pages beyond that. Similarly for 8's.\n\nWait, but 488 is not a multiple of 10. Let me calculate how many complete blocks there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages.\n\nIn each block, there's exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for the units place, the count for 4's would be 48 (from the blocks) plus 1 if the remainder includes a 4. But wait, the remainder is 8, so the last few pages are 481 to 488. In the units place, the digits here are 1 through 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place of the extra pages. Therefore, the number of 4's in the units place is just 48, and the same for 8's, since 8 appears once in each block and in the extra pages, 8 is present once (page 488). Wait, but page 488 is the last page, so in the units place, 8 appears once in the extra pages. So, for 8's, it's 48 (from blocks) +1 (from extra) = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the units place of the extra 8 pages (481-488), the digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, actually, in the units place, the count for 4's is 48 (from blocks) +1 (from extra) = 49, and for 8's it's also 48 (from blocks) +1 (from extra) = 49. Hmm, so maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, no, the total number of pages is 488, so the last page is 488, which is part of the 48th block plus 8 pages. So, in each block of 10, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, for each digit, in the units place, the count per digit is the number of complete blocks times 1, plus whether the digit appears in the remaining pages.\n\nSo, for 4's in units place: 48 blocks give 48 fours, and in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 +1 =49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 48 blocks give 48 eights, and in the remaining 8 pages, 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, so both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place? That seems correct because in each block, each digit appears once, and in the remaining 8 pages, both 4 and 8 appear once.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 0-9, 1 for 10-19, ..., 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, how many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, let me think: for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times per hundred. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times each digit appears in the tens place. But wait, 488 is more than 400, so we have an extra 88 pages beyond 400.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider how many times each digit appears in the tens place across all page numbers up to 488.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. Pages 1-99: The tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. Pages 100-199: Similarly, the tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, another 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8.\n\n3. Pages 200-299: Same as above, another 10 each.\n\n4. Pages 300-399: Same, another 10 each.\n\n5. Pages 400-488: Now, here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, the digits go from 0 (for 400-409) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, how many times does each digit appear?\n\nWell, for digits 0-7 in the tens place, each appears 10 times because each ten's group (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) has 10 pages. So, 0 appears 10 times, 1 appears 10 times, ..., up to 7 appears 10 times.\n\nBut for 8 in the tens place, it's only from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nSo, in pages 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). Wait, no, wait: in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Pages 1-399: For the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times (since 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times). Wait, no, that's not correct because each hundred contributes 10 times per digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 times for each digit in the tens place, but wait, 1-99 is one hundred, 100-199 another, etc., up to 300-399. So, that's four hundreds, each contributing 10 times per digit in the tens place, so 4*10=40 times each digit in the tens place for 1-399.\n\nThen, pages 400-488: as above, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total in tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from 1-399) +10 (from 400-488) =50 times.\n\n- 8's: 40 (from 1-399) +9 (from 400-488) =49 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nWait, let me check: from 1-399, each digit in the tens place appears 40 times, so 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 40 times. Then, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40+10=50, and 8's:40+9=49.\n\nOkay, that seems right.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total counts so far:\n\n- 4's: Units place (49) + Tens place (50) + Hundreds place (89) = 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188.\n\n- 8's: Units place (49) + Tens place (49) + Hundreds place (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, so 4's total 188, 8's total 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 4's: 48 blocks (each contributing 1) +1 in the extra pages (484) =49.\n\n- 8's: 48 blocks +1 in the extra pages (488) =49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from 1-399) +10 (from 400-488) =50.\n\n- 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's:89 (from 400-488).\n\n- 8's:0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49+50+89= 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss any pages.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate for each digit place separately, which I did, so that should be accurate.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0-7, it's 10 times each, and 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 4 in tens place: 10 times (440-449). 8 in tens place:9 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the units place, from 400-488, the units digits cycle 0-9 for each ten's group. So, in the last partial group (480-488), units digits are 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:50\n\n- Hundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:49\n\n- Hundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. For example, is the hundreds digit 4 only from 400-488? Yes, because the book ends at 488, so 400-488 is 89 pages, each with hundreds digit 4. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to calculate the total number of digits printed. Wait, but that might not be necessary here, but just to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small program or use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each place up to a certain number. But since I'm doing this manually, let me try another approach.\n\nFor the units place, as I did earlier, each digit 0-9 appears equally, so for 488 pages, the number of times a digit appears in the units place is floor(488/10)=48 times each, plus if the remainder is >= the digit, add 1. So, for 4, since 488 mod 10=8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49. Similarly for 8, since 8<=8, so 48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred, so for 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds and 88 pages. So, for each digit, in the tens place, it's 4*10=40 times. Then, for the remaining 88 pages (from 400-488), the tens digit cycles 0-8. So, for each digit 0-7, it appears 10 times (since 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 470-479), which is 8 tens groups, each contributing 10 times. Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for digits 0-7, each appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times. So, for 4 in the tens place: 10 times in 400-488, plus the 40 times from 1-399, totaling 50. For 8, it's 9 times in 400-488, plus 40 from 1-399, totaling 49.\n\nIn the hundreds place, as I thought, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49+0=98, difference=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - For 488 pages, there are 48 complete blocks of 10, contributing 48 occurrences each of 4 and 8.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more 4 (at 484) and 1 more 8 (at 488).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - For 488 pages, the first 399 pages contribute 40 occurrences each of 4 and 8.\n   - Pages 400-488:\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that each page is numbered from 1 to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nMaybe I should break this down by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. That way, I can systematically count the occurrences without missing any.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the digit 4 appears once every 10 pages, and the same goes for 8.\n\nBut wait, since the book has 488 pages, I need to see how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then check if there's a partial block at the end.\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages and an extra 8 pages. In each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each. Now, the last 8 pages (481 to 488) will have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times as well. Hmm, so they're equal in the units place.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears in the units place 48 times for each complete block of 10, and then in the last partial block, 1-8, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So yes, units place: 48 +1 =49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n\nBut our book is 488 pages, which is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, let's see. For the hundreds place, we'll handle that next, but first, the tens place.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me correct that. The tens place cycles every 100, but each digit appears 10 times per hundred. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds do we have? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the last partial hundred is 401-488. Let's look at the tens place here. The tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in this range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It would be when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449. That's 10 pages. Similarly, how about 8? The tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, adding that to the previous 40 each, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. For the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. When the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0, but we don't count leading zeros. So, let's see.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit changes every hundred. So, from 1-99, hundreds digit is 0 (not counted). From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8? Well, in the hundreds place, 8 would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nStarting with 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\n\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nNow for 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\n\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again.\n\nFor 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) gives 188.\n\nFor 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98, plus 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me go through each digit place again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 for 4 and 8. So, 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units for 4: 48 +1=49, same for 8: 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 each. Then, the last 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit here cycles from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. When it's 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 more times, 8 appears 9 more times. So, total for 4: 40 +10=50, and for 8: 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. That's 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book doesn't reach 800. So, 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 pages. So, 488 -400 =88, plus 1 is 89. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIs there any other place where 8 might appear? Well, in the units and tens places, we've already considered those.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, from 401-488, when the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 488 is included, so 8 appears once in the units place in the last partial block.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I calculated the units place, I considered each complete block of 10 pages, which gives 48 blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the last 8 pages contribute one 4 and one 8. So, 49 each. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 times each for 4 and 8. Then, the last partial hundred contributes 10 for 4 and 9 for 8. So, 50 for 4 and 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, only 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 for 4 and 0 for 8.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's total 188, 8's total 98. The difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Complete blocks: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 blocks.\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - Last 8 pages (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (1-400).\n   - Each digit appears 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n   - Last 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total tens: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4; 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to consider how page numbers are structured. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers will range from 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), and three-digit (100-488).\n\nI guess I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place one by one.\n\n1. **Units place for 4's:**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, I'll take the integer part, which is 48 full blocks. Each contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times.\n   - But wait, the last block might not be complete. From 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, there's another 4 at 484. That adds one more 4, making it 49 in total for the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place for 4's:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - How many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n   - For each full hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 only in the range 440-449. That's 10 more numbers, so 10 more 4's.\n   - Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 more.\n   - So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 4's:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. When I calculated units place, I considered 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then from 481-488, units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, adding one more, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place: each hundred block contributes 10, so 4 blocks give 40, and the last partial block (401-488) has 440-449, which is 10, so 50 total. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\n1. **Units place for 8's:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every block of 10 has one 8 in the units place.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48.\n   - The last partial block is 481-488, where units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more, making it 49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 8's:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So that's 9 occurrences.\n   - So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 8's:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 9, not 10. So 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So subtract 98 from 188.\n\n188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let's see: from 400 to 488, inclusive. So 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, the hundreds place is zero because 800 is beyond 488. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo 4's total: 188, 8's total: 98. Difference is 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's digit by digit, place by place, but maybe I can use a formula or another method to confirm.\n\nAnother way is to calculate for each digit place separately.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48, and if the last digit is >=4, add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, add 1: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place: floor(488 / 100) * 10 = 4 * 10 = 40. Then, check the last partial hundred: 488 mod 100 = 88. So the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is within 400-488. So 10 more, making 50.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in tens place: floor(488 / 100) * 10 = 4 * 10 = 40. The last partial hundred: 488 mod 100 = 88, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, making 49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: if the hundreds digit is 4, then from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: hundreds digit is 8 only if page numbers are 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 90, but I feel like maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can list out the numbers and count, but that's impractical for 488 pages. Alternatively, perhaps I can check for a smaller number to see if my method works.\n\nLet's take a smaller example, say a 20-page book, and see how many 1's and 2's are there.\n\nPage numbers 1-20.\n\nCount of 1's:\n\nUnits place: 1,11,21 (but 21 is beyond 20, so 1 and 11: 2 times.\n\nTens place: 10-19: 10 times.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 1's: 2 + 10 = 12.\n\nCount of 2's:\n\nUnits place: 2,12: 2 times.\n\nTens place: 20: 1 time.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 2's: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nDifference: 12 - 3 = 9.\n\nWait, but let me list them:\n\nNumbers with 1's:\n\n1 (1), 10-19 (each has 1 in tens place), and 11 has an extra 1.\n\nSo units: 1,11: 2.\n\nTens: 10-19: 10.\n\nTotal: 12.\n\nNumbers with 2's:\n\n2,12 (units), and 20 (tens).\n\nSo units: 2,12: 2.\n\nTens: 20:1.\n\nTotal: 3.\n\nDifference: 12-3=9. So my method works here.\n\nSimilarly, let's check for 4's and 8's in a smaller range, say 1-100.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits: 10 (4,14,...,94).\n\nTens: 10 (40-49).\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal: 20.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits:10 (8,18,...,98).\n\nTens:10 (80-89).\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal:20.\n\nDifference:0.\n\nWhich makes sense because in 1-100, 4's and 8's appear equally in units and tens places.\n\nWait, but in 1-100, the hundreds place is 0 for both, so total 20 each.\n\nSo my method works here too.\n\nAnother test: 1-200.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits: floor(200/10)=20, but since 200 mod 10 is 0, so units:20.\n\nTens: floor(200/100)*10=2*10=20. Then check last partial hundred: 200 mod 100=0, so tens digit 4 is in 140-149 and 240-249, but 200 is the end, so 140-149 is 10, and 240-249 is beyond 200, so only 10.\n\nHundreds: 400-499, which is beyond 200, so 0.\n\nTotal 4's:20 +10=30.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits: floor(200/10)=20.\n\nTens: floor(200/100)*10=2*10=20. Then last partial hundred:200 mod 100=0, so tens digit 8 in 180-189 and 280-289, but 200 is the end, so only 180-189:10.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 8's:20 +10=30.\n\nDifference:0.\n\nSo again, same count.\n\nBut in our original problem, the book ends at 488, which is less than 500, so the hundreds digit for 4's is only up to 488, giving 89, while for 8's, it's zero.\n\nSo going back, I think my initial calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 4's. Correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, since 800 is beyond 488, no 8's in the hundreds place. So 0.\n\nSo, yes, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I guess I should consider each digit place separately: the units place and the tens place. Because when you print page numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in each place with some frequency, and I need to count how often 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the problem. The book has pages from 1 to 488. So, I need to count the number of times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to do this is to consider each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and calculate the frequency of 4 and 8 in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, every digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 pages. So, in pages 1-10, the units digits go from 1 to 0 (since page 1 is 1, page 2 is 2, ..., page 10 is 0). Wait, actually, page 10 is 10, so the units digit is 0. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages.\n\nBut since the book goes up to 488 pages, I need to see how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then account for any remaining pages.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages and then 8 more pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). So, for the units place:\n\nIn each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like page 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8, 18, 28, etc.).\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from each block) plus any additional in the remaining pages. The remaining pages after 480 are 481 to 488. So, the units digits in these pages are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, there's one more 4 (page 484) and one more 8 (page 488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the first block (1-10), page 10 has units digit 0, so actually, in the first block, the units digits go from 1 to 0. So, does that mean that in the units place, each digit 0-9 appears exactly once every 10 pages, except maybe for the first block? Wait, no, because page 1 is 1, so the units digits start at 1 and go up to 0 at page 10. So, in the first block, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit from 0-9 appears once in the units place every 10 pages, including 0.\n\nSo, for each block of 10, the units digit cycles through 0-9. Therefore, in each block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well.\n\nSince there are 48 complete blocks (480 pages), each contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, the number of 4's and 8's is the same.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (pages 1-9) to 9 (pages 90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut since the book goes up to 488, let's see how this works.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. Wait, no, I'm focusing on the tens place now. So, from page 1 to page 488, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488) will have the tens digit cycling through 0-9 for each set of 10 pages.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place across all pages.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- From page 1 to page 99: The tens digit cycles 0-9 for each ten pages, and each digit appears 10 times. So, in 1-99, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\n- From page 100 to page 199: Similarly, the tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, another 10 times for each digit.\n\n- From page 200 to page 299: Same thing, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\n- From page 300 to page 399: Each digit appears 10 times.\n\n- From page 400 to page 488: Here, the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place here?\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- Pages 400-409: tens digit is 0 (10 pages)\n- Pages 410-419: tens digit is 1 (10 pages)\n- ...\n- Pages 480-488: tens digit is 8 (9 pages, since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages? Wait, 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 pages? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages.\n\nSo, in the range 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, but the last cycle (8) only has 9 pages instead of 10.\n\nSo, for the tens digit in 400-488:\n\n- Digits 0-7 each appear 10 times (e.g., 0 in 400-409, 1 in 410-419, ..., 7 in 470-479)\n- Digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, in total, for the tens place:\n\n- Pages 1-99: 10 times each digit\n- Pages 100-199: 10 times each digit\n- Pages 200-299: 10 times each digit\n- Pages 300-399: 10 times each digit\n- Pages 400-488: digits 0-7: 10 times each, digit 8: 9 times\n\nSo, total for each digit in the tens place:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 4 times 10 (from 1-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 times each\n- For digit 8: 4 times 10 (from 1-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49 times\n- For digit 9: 4 times 10 (from 1-399) + 0 (since 400-488 doesn't reach 490-499) = 40 times\n\nWait, no, actually, from 1-399, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred, so 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) would be 4*10=40 times each. Then, in 400-488, as above.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nEach hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 100 pages, and in each, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, from 1-100: 10 times each digit\n101-200: another 10 times each\n201-300: another 10 times each\n301-400: another 10 times each\nSo, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 40 times each digit in the tens place.\n\nThen, from 401-488: as above, the tens digit cycles 0-8, with 0-7 each appearing 10 times (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479), and 8 appearing 9 times (480-488). Wait, but 400-409 is part of the 400-488 range, but 400-409 is 10 pages, so 0 appears 10 times, 1 appears 10 times (410-419), etc., up to 8 appearing 9 times.\n\nSo, from 400-488, the tens digits:\n\n- 0: 10\n- 1: 10\n- 2: 10\n- 3: 10\n- 4: 10\n- 5: 10\n- 6: 10\n- 7: 10\n- 8: 9\n- 9: 0\n\nSo, adding to the previous 40 times each digit:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 40 + 10 = 50\n- For digit 8: 40 + 9 = 49\n- For digit 9: 40 + 0 = 40\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because 400-488 is only part of the 400-499 range. So, actually, from 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so digits 0-8 in the tens place, but 9 doesn't appear in the tens place beyond 490-499, which isn't included.\n\nSo, yes, as above, digits 0-8 each get some counts in the tens place from 400-488.\n\nBut wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409 (10 pages), 1 for 410-419 (10 pages), ..., 7 for 470-479 (10 pages), and 8 for 480-488 (9 pages). So, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the total counts are:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 40 (from 1-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 each\n- For digit 8: 40 (from 1-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49\n- For digit 9: 40 (from 1-399) + 0 (since 400-488 doesn't reach 490-499) = 40\n\nWait, but actually, from 1-399, each digit in the tens place appears 40 times, because each hundred contributes 10 times, and there are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in 400-488, as above, digits 0-7: 10 each, 8:9.\n\nSo, total in tens place:\n\n- 0: 40 +10=50\n- 1:40+10=50\n- 2:40+10=50\n- 3:40+10=50\n- 4:40+10=50\n- 5:40+10=50\n- 6:40+10=50\n- 7:40+10=50\n- 8:40+9=49\n- 9:40+0=40\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 49 times, and the digit 4 appears 50 times.\n\nWait, but in the units place, both 4 and 8 appeared 49 times each. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit; they can be considered as having 0 in the hundreds place, but since we're only counting digits printed, and the problem says each page is printed once, so I think we should consider the hundreds digit as starting from page 100.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit cycles every 1000 pages, but since our book is only 488 pages, let's see.\n\nFrom page 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (but not printed, so we don't count it)\nFrom page 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\nFrom page 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\nFrom page 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\nFrom page 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 1 appears 100 times (100-199)\n- 2 appears 100 times (200-299)\n- 3 appears 100 times (300-399)\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488, which is 89 pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n- 0,5,6,7,8,9: 0 doesn't appear in the hundreds place beyond page 99, and 5-9 only appear if the book had pages beyond 499, which it doesn't. So, digits 5-9 don't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 appears 0 times (since 800-899 isn't part of the book)\n- Similarly, other digits: 1,2,3 appear as above, but we're only interested in 4 and 8.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for 4 and 8 across all digit places.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full blocks (480 pages) and 8 extra pages.\n- In the units place, 48*1=48 each, plus in the extra 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so one 4 and one 8. So, 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred block contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place.\n- From 1-399: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 40 each.\n- From 400-488: tens digits 0-8, with 0-7 appearing 10 times each, and 8 appearing 9 times.\n- So, 40 + 10 = 50 for digits 0-7 in the tens place, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n- So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 100-199: 1 appears 100 times\n- 200-299: 2 appears 100 times\n- 300-399: 3 appears 100 times\n- 400-488: 4 appears 89 times\n- So, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. Maybe I can count how many times 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's. That should give me the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets. That means 48 times each digit appears in the units place. But wait, the last set isn't complete because 488 is the last page. So, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the 489th set, which is just 481-488, the units digits are 1 to 8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, actually, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 48 times each plus one more time each in the last partial set. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit for 488 is 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times and 8 appears 48 times plus one more in 488, making it 49 times. Wait, no, because in each complete set of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 complete sets mean 48 times each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8, meaning 4 appears once and 8 appears once in the last partial set. So, units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the last set. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, for each digit, units place: 48 complete sets (each contributing 1) plus 1 more in the last set, so total 49 times for both 4 and 8.\n\nWait, but 488 is page 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the last set. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48*1 +1 = 49 for 4, and 48*1 +1 = 49 for 8.\n\nWait, but that would mean both digits appear the same number of times in the units place, which is 49 each. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.\n\nFor the units place, the number of times a digit appears is equal to the number of complete tens plus any additional in the partial ten. So, for 488 pages, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if 4 is less than or equal to the last digit. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the formula is: for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to n is (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if d <= (n % 10) else 0). So, for 4 in units place: (488 // 10) = 48, and since 4 <= 8 (the last digit), add 1. So, 48 +1 =49 times. Similarly, for 8 in units place: (488 //10)=48, and since 8 <=8, add 1, so 48 +1=49 times. So, both digits appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages. So, for 488 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, from 1-100, 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49). Similarly, from 101-200, it's another 10 times (140-149), and so on. Now, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nWait, no, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's break it down:\n\nFrom 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 times.\n\nFrom 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 times.\n\nFrom 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 times.\n\nFrom 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 times.\n\nNow, from 401-488: the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total times 4 appears in the tens place: 4 times 10 (from each hundred) plus 10 from 440-449, but wait, 488 is less than 450, so from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. So, total for 4 in tens place: 4*10 +10=50 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, 440-449 is part of that, so that's 10 times. So, total for 4 in tens place: 4*10 (from 1-400) +10=50 times.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see:\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89 \u219210 times.\n\nFrom 101-200:180-189\u219210 times.\n\nFrom 201-300:280-289\u219210 times.\n\nFrom 301-400:380-389\u219210 times.\n\nFrom 401-488: the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-488 is part of that. So, 480-488 is 9 pages (480-488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, total for 8 in tens place: 4*10 +9=49 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the pages are 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in that last partial hundred. So, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, for the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case, since the book has 488 pages. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages (400-488). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the appearances:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times. That seems correct because each digit appears once every 10 pages, and 488//10=48, plus 1 more in the last partial set, so 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 appears 50 times: 4 times 10 in the first four hundreds (1-400), plus 10 times in 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 4*10 +10=50.\n\n- 8 appears 49 times: 4 times 10 in the first four hundreds, plus 9 times in 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times: from 400-488, which is 89 pages (488-400+1=89).\n\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 times, correct. So, 89 is correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4, it's 50 times, and for 8, 49 times.\n\nUnits place: both 49.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the tens place for 4. From 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 440-449 is 10 pages, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in that range.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times there.\n\nSo, yes, 50 for 4 and 49 for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, the total difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - For each set of 10 consecutive pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20), the digits 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488 pages (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), contributing 48 occurrences each.\n   - In the last partial set (481-488), both 4 (at 484) and 8 (at 488) appear once.\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 each.\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages.\n   - For 488 pages:\n     - **4's:** Appear in the tens place 10 times in each of the first four hundreds (40-49, 140-149, etc.), totaling 40. Additionally, in 440-449, 4 appears 10 times, making it 50.\n     - **8's:** Appear similarly in each hundred, totaling 40. In the last partial hundred (401-488), 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times, making it 49.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n4. **Summing Up Occurrences:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Total 4's - Total 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's about counting the number of times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and then doing the same for the digit 8. Then, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nAlright, so I think the best way to approach this is to count the occurrences of each digit separately in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place. That way, I can ensure I don't miss any numbers and cover all positions where 4 or 8 might appear.\n\nLet me start by considering the digits in the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a complete set of numbers. But since we're only going up to 488, I need to check if 488 is a complete set or if I have to adjust for that.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is not a multiple of 10, so the units digit doesn't complete a full cycle from 0 to 9 in the last set. So maybe I should calculate how many full cycles there are and then handle the remaining numbers.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers.\n\nIn each group of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So for the digit 4, in each group, it appears once. Similarly, for the digit 8, it also appears once per group.\n\nSo for 48 complete groups, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48 * 1 = 48. Similarly, the number of 8's would be 48 * 1 = 48.\n\nNow, we have 8 extra numbers after the 48th group, which would be 481 to 488. Let me list them: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488.\n\nLooking at the units digits here: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So in these 8 numbers, the digit 4 appears once (in 484) and the digit 8 appears once (in 488).\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. The total number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so they are equal here? Hmm, that's interesting. So in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So the difference here is zero. But let me not jump to conclusions yet; I need to check the tens and hundreds places as well.\n\nMoving on to the tens place:\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99.\n\nSo for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then the last partial hundred is 401-488.\n\nSo let's calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFirst, in each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4 and 4 * 10 = 40 times for 8.\n\nNow, the partial hundred is 401-488. Let's see how the tens digit behaves here.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So the tens digit cycles through 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nFor each tens digit, there are 10 numbers except for the last one, which only goes up to 88 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 numbers, so 8 full tens (0-9) but only 8 numbers in the last tens group (80-88). Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 pages, so starting from 401, the tens digit cycles every 10 numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the tens digits from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is only 8 times because 488 is the end.\n\nWait, no, let's count properly. From 401 to 488, that's 88 numbers. So the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because 488 is the last number. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So for the tens digit 8 in 401-488, it appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488: that's 9 numbers. So in the tens place, digit 8 appears 9 times in this partial hundred.\n\nSimilarly, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times in the tens place in 401-488. So how does this affect the count for 4 and 8?\n\nIn the tens place, in the partial hundred (401-488):\n\n- Digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 440-449. Wait, no, 401-488, so 440-449 is within this range, right? 440 is 440, and 449 is 449, both within 401-488. So that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.\n\n- Digit 8 appears in the tens place for 9 numbers: 480-488, as we saw earlier.\n\nSo in the tens place, in the partial hundred:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times.\n\n- 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place across all pages:\n\n- 4 appears 4 (complete hundreds) * 10 (each) + 10 (partial hundred) = 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n- 8 appears 4 (complete hundreds) * 10 (each) + 9 (partial hundred) = 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nSo in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So that's a difference of 1 in favor of 4.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so they contribute 0 to the count. Pages 100-199 have a hundreds digit of 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, we need to see how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFirst, 8 in the hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the count for 8 in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, for 4 in the hundreds place: pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times.\n\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 in favor of 4.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- 4: 49 times.\n\n- 8: 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4: 50 times.\n\n- 8: 49 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4: 89 times.\n\n- 8: 0 times.\n\nNow, adding these up:\n\nTotal number of 4's = units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's = units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188 - 98 = 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 in the units place. So 48 each.\n\n- Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have 4 and 8 each once, so 48 + 1 = 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each complete hundred (4 of them) contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So 4*10=40 each.\n\n- The partial hundred (401-488) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (440-449) and 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (480-488). So 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n\n- 8 never appears here.\n\nSo adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me think again: 488 pages, so the hundreds digit is only up to 4, which explains why 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. And in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times, which is just one more for 4. In the units place, they are equal. So the main difference comes from the hundreds place, where 4 appears 89 times, while 8 doesn't appear at all there.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in the partial hundred, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times for 4 in the tens place. And 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times for 8 in the tens place. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so no difference there.\n\nSo yes, the difference is 90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488 pages (488 \u00f7 10 = 48 with a remainder of 8).\n   - Each group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - Total for 48 groups: 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in each block of 100.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n   - Total for complete hundreds: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 each.\n   - The partial hundred (401-488) contributes:\n     - 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (440-449).\n     - 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (480-488).\n   - Total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, contributing 89 occurrences of 4.\n   - The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place in this range.\n\n4. **Summing Up the Counts:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488. Then, I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the positions where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll have to check each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. To find out how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4. That would be 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 49th set would be from 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the units digit 4 would appear in 484. So, actually, from 1-480, there are 48 sets, each contributing a 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4. So, in each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, from 1 to 488, there are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488). Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, how many full hundreds are there? Let me think: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. That's four full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488. Wait, no, 440 is in 401-488, right? So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10. So total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, does the tens digit 4 occur in 440-449? Yes, that's correct. So that's 10 more, making it 50 in total for the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-499. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 occurs from 400-488. How many numbers is that? It's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, in each set of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490). But since we're stopping at 488, the last set is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, in each full set of 10, there's one 8 in the units place. So, 48 sets would give 48 8's. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 8 appears at 488, so that's one more. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. From 1 to 488, how many full hundreds are there? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, four full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we stop at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit 8 is only in 480-489, so in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 is 4-8-0, 481 is 4-8-1, up to 488, which is 4-8-8. So, that's 9 numbers, but wait, 480 is included, so that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, but from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, adding that to the 40 from the full hundreds, we get 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought it was 10 in each hundred, but in the last partial hundred, it's 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full sets (1-480) give 48, plus 484, so 49. That seems right.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40, plus 440-449 in 401-488, which is 10, so 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full sets (1-480) give 48, plus 488, so 49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40, plus 480-488, which is 9, so 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - In each set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once.  \n   - From 1 to 480: 48 sets \u00d7 1 = 48 occurrences.  \n   - From 481 to 488: 484 adds 1 more.  \n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - In each hundred, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49).  \n   - From 1 to 400: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - From 401 to 488: 440-449 adds 10.  \n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - From 400 to 488: 89 numbers.  \n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.  \n   - From 1 to 480: 48 occurrences.  \n   - From 481 to 488: 488 adds 1.  \n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - In each hundred, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89).  \n   - From 1 to 400: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - From 401 to 488: 480-488 adds 9 (since 488 is included).  \n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"
