    "text": " Maybe I should count the number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference between them.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each position, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For numbers from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. But I need to see how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each of the 48 complete blocks, the units digit 4 and 8 each appear once. That's 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. Wait, that's the same, so the difference here is zero.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the last partial block. So, 481 to 488. So, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, yes, 49 each. So, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each block of 100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each digit in the tens place, it appears 10 times per block. So, for 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in 4 blocks, that's 4*10 = 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the partial block from 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the end). So, for the tens place, we need to see how many times 4 and 8 appear. From 401-488, the tens digits go through 0-8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 times. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 times. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. So, 50 fours and 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for numbers from 100 onwards. So, in 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's zero. From 100-488, the hundreds digit cycles as 1, 2, 3, and 4. Let me see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 100 times.\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, 100 times.\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, 100 times.\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, 89 times (since 400 to 488 is 89 numbers).\n\nWait, 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times, and the digits 1, 2, 3 each appear 100 times. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each complete block of 10 contributes 1 four and 1 eight.\n- 48 complete blocks: 48 each.\n- Partial block 481-488: 484 and 488, so 1 four and 1 eight.\n- Total: 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each complete block of 100 contributes 10 fours and 10 eights.\n- 4 complete blocks: 40 each.\n- Partial block 401-488: tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- So, 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 doesn't appear. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so hundreds digit is 4 for each, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit being 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the end. So, 9 times. So, 40 (from complete blocks) +10=50 for 4, and 40+9=49 for 8. Correct.\n\nUnits place, as checked earlier, is 49 each.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but the problem is about page numbers, so page 1 is page 1, and page 488 is page 488. So, I think my counting is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place again. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, so 100 times. 200-299: 2, 100 times. 300-399:3, 100 times. 400-488:4, 89 times. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, correct.\n\nSo, yeah, the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but wait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears there. So, that's a significant contribution to the total count of 4's.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 complete blocks (1-480) contribute 48 each.\n   - Partial block (481-488) contributes one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours and 10 eights.\n   - 4 complete blocks (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - Partial block (401-488) contributes 10 fours (440-449) and 9 eights (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should approach this by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For the units digit, how often does 4 appear? Well, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). Similarly, in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, for the entire range up to 488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each full block, 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, let's do the same. Each block of 10 has one 8 in the units place, so again 48 full blocks give 48 eights. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the difference from units place is zero so far.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. For the tens digit, 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nWell, let's see. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, that's another 10. Then 240-249, another 10, and 340-349, another 10. Now, the next would be 440-449, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times. So, 4 appears 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10. So, how many blocks does that give us?\n\nFirst, 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. Then, 180-189: another 10. Then, 280-289: another 10. Then, 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, so 8 appears 49 times in the tens place, while 4 appears 50 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, since we go up to 488. So, how often does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. 8 is not among these, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, earlier, I thought that in the units place, both 4 and 8 appeared 49 times. Then, in the tens place, 4 appeared 50 times, 8 appeared 49 times. So, the difference in tens place is +1 for 4. In the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times, so that's a difference of +89. So, total difference would be 1 (from tens) + 89 (from hundreds) = 90. So, 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount each place.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor 4 in units place:\n- Each 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48.\n- Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (page 484).\n- Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nFor 8 in units place:\n- Similarly, 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48.\n- From 481 to 488, units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488).\n- Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, units place: both 4 and 8 have 49, so difference is 0.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4 in tens place:\n- 40-49: 10\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\nTotal: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8 in tens place:\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers)\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, 4 in tens: 50, 8 in tens: 49, difference +1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4 in hundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nFor 8 in hundreds place:\n- None, since the book only goes up to 488. So, 0.\n\nSo, 4 in hundreds: 89, 8 in hundreds: 0, difference +89.\n\nNow, adding up the differences:\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nSo, 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for 8 in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, yes, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. 400 to 488 inclusive is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: 400 is page 400, 401 is 401, up to 488. So, 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for 8 in the hundreds place, as I said, none, since 800 would be the next, which is beyond 488.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each block of 10 pages contributes 1 occurrence. With 48 full blocks (480 pages) and an extra 8 pages (481-488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **8's:** Occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occurs in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - **8's:** Does not occur as the book ends at 488, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should approach this by looking at each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, for each complete block of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. Now, let's figure out how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 more pages (481 to 488). In each of these 48 blocks, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the units digit 4 appears once (484), and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place, the total count for 4 is 48 + 1 = 49, and for 8, it's 48 + 1 = 49. So, they're equal in the units place. Now, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, with each digit from 0 to 9 appearing 10 times in each hundred block. So, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in every 100 pages (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in every 100 pages (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of these 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the same for 8. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each for the tens place in the complete hundreds. Now, let's look at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digits here range from 0 to 8. Let's break this down:\n\n- Pages 401-409: Tens digit is 0\n- Pages 410-419: Tens digit is 1\n- Pages 420-429: Tens digit is 2\n- Pages 430-439: Tens digit is 3\n- Pages 440-449: Tens digit is 4 (so 10 pages, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages)\n- Pages 450-459: Tens digit is 5\n- Pages 460-469: Tens digit is 6\n- Pages 470-479: Tens digit is 7\n- Pages 480-488: Tens digit is 8 (but only 9 pages: 480-488)\n\nWait, actually, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but let me check how many times each tens digit appears.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider that in the 88 pages from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\n- Tens digit 0: pages 401-410 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 1: pages 411-420 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 2: pages 421-430 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 3: pages 431-440 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 4: pages 441-450 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 5: pages 451-460 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 6: pages 461-470 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 7: pages 471-480 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 8: pages 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 pages (481-488). Wait, no, pages 480-489 would be tens digit 8, but since we're stopping at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 401 + 88 is 489, but the book ends at 488. So, from 401 to 488, that's 88 pages. So, the last set would be 480-488, which is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480 \u2192 10 pages\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488 \u2192 8 pages? Wait, 481 to 488 is 8 pages, but if we consider 480-488, that's 9 pages (including 480). Wait, but 480 is part of the tens digit 8? Wait no, 480 is 4-8-0, so the tens digit is 8, but the units digit is 0. So, from 480-489, that's 10 pages, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 pages (480-488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\n- 401-410: 10 pages, tens digit 0\n- 411-420: 10 pages, tens digit 1\n- 421-430: 10 pages, tens digit 2\n- 431-440: 10 pages, tens digit 3\n- 441-450: 10 pages, tens digit 4\n- 451-460: 10 pages, tens digit 5\n- 461-470: 10 pages, tens digit 6\n- 471-480: 10 pages, tens digit 7\n- 481-490: 10 pages, tens digit 8\n\nBut since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 pages, but wait, that's only 8 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times? Or is it 9 times because 480 is included?\n\nWait, no, 480 is part of the previous set (471-480). So, 480 is the last page of the tens digit 7. Then, 481-488 would be the next set, with tens digit 8, which is 8 pages (481 to 488 inclusive). So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times. So, in the tens place, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450) and the digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). So, adding that to the 4 complete hundreds, which had 40 times each for tens digits 4 and 8, the total for tens place would be:\n\n- For 4: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\n- For 8: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nWait, but wait, in the 4 complete hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), for the tens digit 4, it's 10 times (441-450), and for the tens digit 8, it's 8 times (481-488). So, total for tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nWait, but wait, is that correct? Because in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 is from 441-450, which is 10 pages, so that's correct. And the tens digit 8 is from 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, yes, 48 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check if 481-488 is 8 pages: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Yes, that's 8 pages, so 8 times the digit 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards, up to 488. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see how many times each hundreds digit appears.\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (not printed)\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1 (100 times)\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2 (100 times)\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3 (100 times)\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4 (89 times, since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488)\n- Digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest hundreds digit is 4 (in 400-488). So, the digit 8 in the hundreds place doesn't occur at all in this book.\n\nWait, but wait, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this book, right? So, digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, 99+89=188\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, but wait, let me check again because earlier in the units place, I thought both 4 and 8 had 49 each, but let me make sure.\n\nWait, in the units place, we had 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 for 4, and 48 +1=49 for 8.\n\nIn the tens place, as calculated, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place.\n\nWait, pages 400-488: that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 in all of these, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). But wait, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, but 480 is in the 471-480 range, which is tens digit 7. Wait, no, 480 is 4-8-0, so the tens digit is 8, right? So, 480 is part of the tens digit 8, so from 480-488, that's 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, that changes things. Earlier, I thought it was 8 times, but actually, it's 9 times because 480 is included.\n\nSo, let me correct that:\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in pages 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- For 4: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\n- For 8: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 49\n\nWait, but then in the units place, 8's are 49, and in the tens place, 49, so total 8's would be 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let's recalculate:\n\nWait, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 49\n\nThen, in units place, 49, and hundreds place, 0. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSimilarly, 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by miscalculating the number of times 8 appears in the tens place in the last partial hundred. It should be 9 times, not 8, because 480 is included, making it 9 pages (480-488).\n\nSo, let's recast the total counts:\n\nDigit 4:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nDigit 8:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49 (since 401-488 contributes 9, plus 40 from 1-400, total 49)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more to be sure.\n\nIn the units place, 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 for both.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- From 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each.\n- From 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 to 8. The tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\nSo, total tens place:\n- 4's: 40 +10=50\n- 8's: 40 +9=49\n\nIn the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n- 8 never appears.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages in 480 pages, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - In 400 pages, '4' and '8' each appear 40 times in the tens place.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - '4' appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Only pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place, appearing 89 times.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **'4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **'8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'. \n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should separate the counting based on the number of digits. Let me try to approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4); in 11-20, it appears once (at page 14), and so on. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra pages (481-488). Each of these 48 sets contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more (at 484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each set of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many complete sets of 100 are in 488? There are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488). Each complete set of 100 contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 401-410, which is 10 pages, contributing another 10 fours. So, total fours in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages 400-488. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, contributing 89 fours.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because when considering the hundreds place, each page from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 pages, so 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I overcounted in the hundreds place. Let me think: From 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so no fours there. From 100-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, so no fours. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 pages, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSo, units place: 49 fours, tens place: 50 fours, hundreds place: 89 fours. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to fours, in every 10 pages, 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more (at 488). So, total eights in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In each set of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each set, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, how many complete sets of 100 are there? 4 complete sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, right? So, that's correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. In the range 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. That's 9 pages, so 9 eights. So, 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 fours. That's correct. For eights, since the book doesn't reach 800, there are zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, another way to check: Maybe I should calculate the number of fours and eights in each digit place separately.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units place: For each 10 pages, 1 four. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 fours from complete decades, plus 1 four in the remaining 8 pages (484), total 49.\n\n- Tens place: For each 100 pages, 10 fours in the tens place (40-49, etc.). 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 fours, so 40 fours. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 401-410, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours. So, total 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place: Similar to fours, 48 eights from complete decades, plus 1 in the remaining 8 pages (488), total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place (80-89, etc.), so 40 eights. In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights. So, total 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility I double-counted some numbers? For example, when counting units and tens places, are there overlaps where a number has both a 4 and an 8? But wait, no, because when counting digit occurrences, each digit is considered separately. So, for example, page 48 has a 4 in the tens place and an 8 in the units place, but each digit is counted in their respective places. So, I don't think there's any double-counting issue here.\n\nAnother way to check: Maybe I can calculate the number of fours and eights in each position separately and sum them up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula for digit counting. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as floor(N/10) + adjustment. Similarly for tens, hundreds, etc.\n\nLet me try applying that formula to verify.\n\nFor fours in units place:\n\nNumber of complete decades: floor(488 / 10) = 48. Each contributes 1 four, so 48. Then, the remaining pages after 480 are 8 (481-488). The units digit cycles from 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete centuries: floor(488 / 100) = 4. Each contributes 10 fours (40-49, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then, the remaining pages are 88 (401-488). The tens digit cycles every 100, so in the remaining 88 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's the same as how many complete groups of 10 are there in 88 where the tens digit is 4. Wait, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 401-410, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours. So, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor fours in hundreds place: It's the number of pages where the hundreds digit is 4, which is from 400-488, so 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor eights in units place:\n\nNumber of complete decades: floor(488 / 10) = 48, contributing 48 eights. Remaining pages: 8 (481-488). The units digit cycles from 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nEights in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete centuries: floor(488 / 100) = 4, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Remaining pages: 88 (401-488). The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 480-489 is 10 pages, but we only go up to 488). So, 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nEights in hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think this is correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Each set of 10 pages contributes 1 '4'. \n     - Total complete sets: 48 (from 1-480), contributing 48 '4's.\n     - Remaining pages (481-488): '4' appears once (at 484).\n     - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 '4's.\n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - Each set of 100 pages contributes 10 '4's (e.g., 40-49).\n     - Total complete sets: 4 (from 1-400), contributing 40 '4's.\n     - Remaining pages (401-488): '4' appears in 401-410, contributing 10 '4's.\n     - Total: 40 + 10 = 50 '4's.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place.\n     - Total: 89 '4's (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Each set of 10 pages contributes 1 '8'.\n     - Total complete sets: 48 (from 1-480), contributing 48 '8's.\n     - Remaining pages (481-488): '8' appears once (at 488).\n     - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 '8's.\n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - Each set of 100 pages contributes 10 '8's (e.g., 80-89).\n     - Total complete sets: 4 (from 1-400), contributing 40 '8's.\n     - Remaining pages (401-488): '8' appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n     - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 '8's.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - No pages have '8' in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n     - Total: 0 '8's.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let me start with the units place because that might be the simplest. \n\nFor the units place, I can think of how often the digit 4 appears. In every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in every block of 10 in the units place. So, for both 4 and 8, the count in the units place should be the same. But wait, I need to make sure how many such blocks there are in 488 pages. Let me calculate how many complete tens are there in 488. \n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete tens and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in each of these 48 complete tens, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block of 8 pages (481-488), I need to check if any of these have a 4 or 8 in the units place. Looking at 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, that adds one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. Each complete ten has one 4 and one 8 in the units place, right? So from 1 to 480, there are 480 pages, which is 48 sets of ten. So, 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages, the units digits are 1-8. So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So that's one more 4 and one more 8. So total units place 4's: 48 +1=49, and 8's:48 +1=49. So, same count in units place. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 for 80-89, which is another 10 times. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages in the next hundred (401-488). \n\nSo, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 times 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. \n\nNow, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So, let's see when the tens digit is 4 and 8. \n\nIn 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but we only have up to 488, so that's 9 pages. Hmm, but wait, 480 is included in 401-488, right? So, 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred. \n\nWait, but let me check: from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. When the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. \n\nSo, adding that up, for the tens place, 4's: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 (from the last partial hundred) = 50. 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once more than 8. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. \n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place. \n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each ten has one 4 and one 8 in units place.\n- 488 pages: 48 complete tens (1-480) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n- 48 times each for 4 and 8, plus in 481-488, 484 adds one more 4, and 488 adds one more 8.\n- So, 48 +1 =49 for 4, and 48 +1=49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n- 4 complete hundreds (1-400): 4*10=40 each.\n- Last partial hundred (401-488): \n   - 440-449: 10 times for 4.\n   - 480-488: 9 times for 8.\n- So, 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+9=49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages with 4 in hundreds place.\n- 8 in hundreds place: 0 times.\n- So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the last partial hundred. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. When the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9 times for 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times for 4. \n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place.\n\nFor units place:\n- The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to n is given by floor((n + 1) / 10) if d != 0, or floor(n / 10) if d =0. But since we're dealing with digits 4 and 8, which are non-zero, it's floor((n +1)/10). But let me check.\n\nWait, actually, for units digit, the count is how many times each digit appears in the units place. For example, from 1 to n, the number of times digit d appears in the units place is floor((n + 1)/10) if d !=0, but I think it's actually (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0) when d !=0.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 1)\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try for n=488, digit 4.\n\nn=488, units digit 4:\n\nNumber of complete tens: 488 // 10 =48. Each contributes one 4 in units place, so 48 times.\n\nThen, the remainder is 8 (488 % 10=8). So, if the remainder is >=4, we add 1 more. Since 8 >=4, we add 1. So total 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly for digit 8:\n\nNumber of complete tens:48, each contributes one 8 in units place.\n\nRemainder is 8, which is equal to 8, so add 1. So total 48 +1=49.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nThe number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n can be calculated as:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10 + (if (n % 100) >= 10*d, then (n % 100 -10*d) //10 +1 else 0)\n\nWait, let me test this formula.\n\nFor n=488, digit 4 in tens place:\n\nn//100=4 (since 488//100=4). So, 4*10=40.\n\nThen, n%100=88. We check if 88 >=10*4=40. Yes, it is. So, (88 -40)/10 +1 = (48)/10 +1=4 +1=5. So total 40 +5=45.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count of 50 for 4 in tens place. Hmm, that suggests a mistake in my earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when calculating the tens place, for each hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, for n=488, which is 4 hundreds and 88 pages into the fifth hundred.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4. Each contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 times. So total 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4. Each contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). So, 9 times. So total 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, according to this, 4 appears 50 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 49 times. Which matches my earlier count.\n\nBut when I tried using the formula, I got 45 for 4, which is different. Maybe I applied the formula incorrectly.\n\nWait, let me try applying the formula correctly. The formula for the number of times digit d appears in the tens place up to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10 + max(0, (n % 100 - (d * 10) + 1) // 10)\n\nWait, let me test this for n=488, d=4:\n\nn//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nn%100=88.\n\nd*10=40.\n\nSo, (88 -40 +1) =49.\n\n49//10=4. So, 40 +4=44. Hmm, that's different from my manual count of 50. So, perhaps the formula is not accurate here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is intended for when d is not zero, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should not use the formula and stick to my manual counting, since it seems more accurate.\n\nSo, to avoid confusion, I think my manual count is correct: 50 times for 4 in the tens place, 49 times for 8.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place:\n\nDigit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nDigit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, right? 488 -400 +1=89. So, yes, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd since the book only goes up to 488, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times for 8.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nI think my initial approach was correct, and the difference is indeed 90.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 pages have 48 complete tens and 8 extra pages.\n   - 48 occurrences each, plus one more for 484 (4) and 488 (8).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete hundreds give 40 each.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 gives 10 more 4's, and 480-488 gives 9 more 8's.\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should separate the counting based on the number of digits. Let me start by considering each position in the page numbers: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. For each digit position, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. So, for example, from 1-10, 4 is in 4, and 8 is in 8. Similarly, from 11-20, 4 is in 14, and 8 is in 18, and so on. Now, how many such sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 more pages (481-488). So, for the units place, each digit (4 and 8) appears 48 times in the full sets. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total for units place: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so units place gives equal counts for 4 and 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, that would be 10 times per hundred. Similarly for 8. Now, let's see how many hundreds we have in 488 pages. There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, that's five sets. But wait, 401-488 is only 88 pages, so the tens digit here is from 0-8 for the first 80 pages (401-480), and then 481-488 would have tens digit 8. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all page numbers.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. How many full hundreds do we have? From 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400: that's four full hundreds. So, in each of these, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times, and 8 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, what about the last partial hundred, 401-488? The tens digit here goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's up to 8). So, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It's from 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). Wait, no, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 480-488. Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, in the tens place, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for tens place: 4 appears 40 (from the four full hundreds) + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. For the four full hundreds (1-400), each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place, so 40 each. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 times. So, total tens place: 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once more than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 at maximum. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit position.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 for 4 and 1 for 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have 4 and 8 in units place once each, so total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred (1-100, etc.) contributes 10 for 4 and 10 for 8. Four full hundreds give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 is 10 times for 4, and 480-488 is 9 times for 8. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488), and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 for 4.\n\nFor 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, '4' and '8' each appear once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one '4' and one '8'.\n   - Total: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contains 10 occurrences of '4' and '8' in the tens place.\n   - Four full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - In 401-488, '4' appears 10 times (440-449), and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. But wait, when the units digit is 4 or 8, that's each time they appear in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, 4 is in 4 and 8 is in 8. Then in 11-20, 14 and 18, and so on. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).

Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place. So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. So, in the units place, they're equal.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, right? So, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, yes, that's correct. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights. Now, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, the digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for the digit 4, in the tens place, it appears 10 times in 40-49, right? Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in 80-89. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488?\n\nWell, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well. So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights in the tens place. Now, what about the remaining 88 pages (401-488)?\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let's see, the tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last one). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50 fours, and 40 + 9 = 49 eights. So, in the tens place, fours are 50 and eights are 49. So, fours are one more than eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 10 fours and 9 eights. So, adding to the full hundreds, 40 + 10 = 50 fours, and 40 + 9 = 49 eights. So, the tens place gives fours 50 and eights 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case because the book goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, eights in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, fours are 89 and eights are 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through each step again.\n\nUnits place:\n- 48 full tens (1-480) give 48 fours and 48 eights.\n- Then 481-488: units digits 1-8, so one 4 and one 8.\n- Total: 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 40 fours and 40 eights.\n- Then 401-488: tens digits 0-8.\n  - 440-449: 10 fours.\n  - 480-488: 9 eights.\n- So, fours: 40 + 10 = 50, eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 fours.\n- 800-899: 0 eights, as book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should separate the counts based on the number of digits in the page numbers. Let's start with single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits that appear are 1 through 9. So, for single-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears once (which is page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, so far, 4's are 1 and 8's are 1, so no difference yet. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should consider each place separately. Let's start with the tens place. For the tens place, the digits can be 1 through 9. For each tens digit, there are 10 possible units digits (0-9). So, for example, when the tens digit is 4 (i.e., pages 40-49), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8 (pages 80-89), the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, for the units place in two-digit numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in each ten's group. So, for example, in the 10's group (10-19), the units digits go from 0 to 9, so each digit, including 4 and 8, appears once. Similarly, in the 20's group (20-29), the same applies. So, for each ten's group, the units digit 4 appears once, and the units digit 8 appears once. Since there are 9 ten's groups (10-99), each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place. Wait, but actually, from 10-99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 groups of 10. So, for the units place, each digit (0-9) appears 9 times. Therefore, in the units place for two-digit numbers, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times. Now, adding up the two-digit numbers: for the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (40-49) and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). For the units place, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times. So, total for two-digit numbers: 4's = 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and 8's = 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, in two-digit numbers, 4's and 8's are equal, each appearing 19 times. Now, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because now we have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nI think I should consider each hundreds group separately.\n\nStarting with hundreds digit 1 (100-199). Here, the hundreds digit is 1, so it doesn't contribute to 4's or 8's. The tens and units digits can be from 0-9. So, similar to the two-digit case, but now we have an extra digit.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 1 doesn't affect the count of 4's or 8's, so I can focus on the tens and units places for these pages.\n\nSo, for 100-199, how many times does 4 appear in the tens and units places?\n\nIn the tens place, for each ten's group (e.g., 100-109, 110-119, ..., 190-199), the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears once per ten's group, and each ten's group has 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (from 140-149). Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (180-189).\n\nIn the units place, for each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place across all ten's groups. So, for example, in 100-199, the digit 4 appears in the units place once per ten's group, and there are 10 ten's groups, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the units place.\n\nSo, for 100-199, 4's in tens place: 10, 4's in units place: 10, total 20. Similarly, 8's in tens place: 10, 8's in units place: 10, total 20.\n\nNow, moving on to hundreds digit 2 (200-299). Similar logic applies. The hundreds digit is 2, which doesn't affect 4's or 8's. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (240-249), and 8 appears 10 times (280-289). In the units place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, again, 4's total 20, 8's total 20.\n\nNext, hundreds digit 3 (300-399). Again, hundreds digit is 3, so no effect. Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (340-349), 8 appears 10 times (380-389). Units place: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times. So, 4's: 20, 8's: 20.\n\nNow, the last hundreds group is 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so this will affect the count for 4's but not for 8's. So, let's handle this carefully.\n\nFirst, hundreds digit is 4, so every page from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many pages are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, let's consider the tens and units places in 400-488.\n\nStarting with the tens place. The tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). Wait, but 488 is included, so the tens digit can be 0-8, but for tens digit 8, the units digits only go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Let me clarify:\n\nThe range is 400-488. So, the tens digits can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. But for tens digit 8, the units digits only go from 0-8 because 488 is the maximum. So, for tens digits 0-7, each has 10 units digits (0-9), but for tens digit 8, only 0-8, which is 9 units digits.\n\nSo, let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens and units places in 400-488.\n\nFirst, the tens place:\n\n- Tens digit 4: pages 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\n- Tens digit 8: pages 480-488. That's 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place:\n\nFor units digit 4, in each ten's group, 4 appears once. So, let's go through each ten's group:\n\n- 400-409: units digit 4 is at 404.\n\n- 410-419: 414.\n\n- 420-429: 424.\n\n- 430-439: 434.\n\n- 440-449: 444.\n\n- 450-459: 454.\n\n- 460-469: 464.\n\n- 470-479: 474.\n\n- 480-488: 484.\n\nSo, in each ten's group, units digit 4 appears once, except for the last group (480-488), where 484 is included, so that's still one occurrence. So, how many ten's groups are there? From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 ten's groups. Each has one occurrence of units digit 4, so total 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8:\n\nIn each ten's group, units digit 8 appears once, except for the last group (480-488), where units digit 8 appears at 488, which is included. So, again, 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\n- 400-409: 408.\n\n- 410-419: 418.\n\n- 420-429: 428.\n\n- 430-439: 438.\n\n- 440-449: 448.\n\n- 450-459: 458.\n\n- 460-469: 468.\n\n- 470-479: 478.\n\n- 480-488: 488.\n\nSo, that's 9 occurrences of units digit 8.\n\nWait, but in the last group, 488 is included, so units digit 8 appears once. So, total units digit 8's: 9.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times (in 480-488). So, in the units place, 8 appears 9 times as well.\n\nSo, for the units place in 400-488, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, let's add up the counts for 4's and 8's in the three-digit numbers:\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488).\n\n- Tens place: 10 times (440-449).\n\n- Units place: 9 times (as calculated above).\n\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Tens place: 9 times (480-488).\n\n- Units place: 9 times (as calculated above).\n\nBut wait, in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18.\n\nWait, that seems low. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, in the three-digit numbers, we have:\n\n- Hundreds digit: 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nWe've already considered 400-488, where hundreds digit is 4, so 8's don't appear there except in tens and units.\n\nBut for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, we had 20 each for 4's and 8's in tens and units.\n\nWait, no, earlier, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each had 20 4's and 20 8's in the tens and units places.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, the total 4's would be:\n\n- 100-199: 20.\n\n- 200-299: 20.\n\n- 300-399: 20.\n\n- 400-488: 108 (as calculated).\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 20 + 20 + 20 + 108 = 168.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 each have 20 4's, and 400-488 has 108 4's, so total 20*3 + 108 = 60 + 108 = 168.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 20.\n\n- 200-299: 20.\n\n- 300-399: 20.\n\n- 400-488: 18.\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought that in 400-488, 8's appear 18 times (9 in tens, 9 in units). So, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 20 + 20 + 20 + 18 = 78.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because in 400-488, 8's in tens and units are 9 each, so 18, but in the other hundreds groups, each has 20 8's, so 20*3=60, plus 18 makes 78.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 20 8's in the tens and units places. So, 20 each, so 20*3=60. Then, in 400-488, 8's in tens and units places are 9 each, so 18. So total 8's in three-digit numbers: 60 + 18 = 78.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in 400-488, 8's in tens and units are 9 each, so 18. So, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 20*3 + 18 = 78.\n\nBut wait, let me check the 4's in 400-488 again. The hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times. Then, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449). In the units place, 4 appears 9 times (once in each ten's group, 9 ten's groups). So, 89 + 10 + 9 = 108 4's in 400-488.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 20 + 20 + 20 + 108 = 168.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 20 + 20 + 20 + 18 = 78.\n\nWait, but that seems a big difference. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately across all page numbers.\n\nWait, let's think again. Maybe I should break it down by each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nSo, for all page numbers from 1 to 488, let's calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each block of 10, 4 appears once. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So total units digit 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8:\n\nIn each block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. In the last partial block (481-488), units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units digit 4's and 8's were equal, but in three-digit numbers, I had a different count. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check.\n\nWait, when I considered three-digit numbers, I thought that in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each had 20 4's and 20 8's, but perhaps that's not correct because when considering all three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit doesn't affect the units and tens counts.\n\nWait, perhaps using the units and tens place approach is better.\n\nSo, moving on to the tens place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 1 to 488?\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each position, except possibly in the last partial group.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for example, in 1-99, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 100-199, the tens digit 4 appears in 140-149, another 10 times, and so on.\n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there? Up to 488, so 4 complete hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 400-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 complete hundreds would have 4*10=40 times. But wait, 488 is less than 500, so actually, from 1-488, the hundreds are 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 5 segments, but the last one is incomplete.\n\nWait, but 1-99 is two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times the tens digit is 4 in all ranges.\n\nFrom 1-99:\n\nTens digit 4: 10-19? No, wait, tens digit 4 is in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-199: tens digit 4 is in 140-149, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: 240-249, 10 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: 340-349, 10 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit 8:\n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89, 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, 10 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, 10 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, 10 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page), so tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nOnly in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nSince the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49.\n\n- Tens place: 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49.\n\n- Tens place: 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was calculating three-digit numbers, I had 168 4's and 78 8's, which would give a difference of 90 as well. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place calculation. I thought that from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears 49 times. Let me confirm that.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, it's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there?\n\nThe first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, yes, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8, it's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, so ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times.\n\nFor the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, as calculated earlier, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was calculating three-digit numbers, I had 168 4's and 78 8's, which would also give a difference of 90, so that seems consistent.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should separate the counts based on the number of digits. Let me try to count the number of 4's and 8's in each category: single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits are just 1 through 9. So, the number 4 appears once, and the number 8 appears once. So, in single-digit pages, the count for 4 is 1 and for 8 is 1. That means so far, 4 and 8 are tied at 1 each.\n\nNext, let's move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in both places.\n\nFirst, for the tens place in two-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 1 to 9, and for each tens digit, the units digit can be from 0 to 9. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 80 to 89, which is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. For each tens digit (1-9), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each tens digit, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 possible tens digits (1-9), that means 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and 8 also appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nAdding that up, for two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, in two-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. So, so far, the total count for 4 is 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20, and for 8, it's 1 + 19 = 20. They're still tied.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places to consider: hundreds, tens, and units. Also, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, let's break it down by each place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, it's only when the hundreds digit is 4, which covers pages 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. Here, the tens digit can be 0-9, and the hundreds digit can be 1-4. But since we're considering all three-digit numbers up to 488, we have to be careful when the hundreds digit is 4 because the tens digit can only go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Let me break this down.\n\nFor the tens place, let's consider each possible hundreds digit:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: Tens can be 0-9, so 4 appears in the tens place how many times? For each hundreds digit, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, for hundreds digit 1, when the tens digit is 4, the units can be 0-9, giving 10 numbers (140-149). Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, it's 10 numbers (180-189). So, for hundreds digit 1, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: Similarly, when hundreds digit is 2, the tens digit can be 0-9. So, 4 appears 10 times (240-249), and 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: Same logic, 4 appears 10 times (340-349), and 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: Now, this is where it gets a bit tricky because the book ends at 488. So, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, let's see:\n\n  - Tens digit 4: The numbers would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here.\n\n  - Tens digit 8: The numbers would be 480-488. Wait, that's only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 4, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nAdding this all up for the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- For 4: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 10 (hundreds=4) = 40 times.\n\n- For 8: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39 times.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check. For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, the tens digit 4 and 8 each contribute 10 numbers, so 10 times each. But for hundreds digit 4, tens digit 4 contributes 10 numbers (440-449), and tens digit 8 contributes 9 numbers (480-488). So, yes, 40 times for 4 and 39 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, and the tens digit can be 0-9, except when hundreds digit is 4, tens digit can only go up to 8. But for the units place, regardless of the tens digit, the units digit cycles through 0-9 for each combination.\n\nLet me think about this. For each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4) and each tens digit (0-9, except when hundreds=4, tens can only go up to 8), the units digit cycles 0-9. So, for each valid hundreds and tens combination, the units digit can be 0-9, so 4 appears once in the units place for each combination, and 8 appears once in the units place for each combination.\n\nBut wait, when hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8, so the number of combinations is less. Let me break it down:\n\nFirst, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3:\n\n- Each has 10 possible tens digits (0-9), and for each, the units digit can be 0-9. So, for each hundreds digit, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 10 (tens digits) * 1 (units digit=4) = 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSince there are 3 hundreds digits (1,2,3), that's 3*10 = 30 times for 4 and 30 times for 8.\n\nNow, for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- The tens digit can be 0-8, so that's 9 possible tens digits. For each, the units digit cycles 0-9, so for each tens digit, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once. So, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nAdding that up, for the units place:\n\n- 4: 30 (from 1,2,3) + 9 (from 4) = 39 times.\n\n- 8: 30 (from 1,2,3) + 9 (from 4) = 39 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times.\n\nSo, summarizing the three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nAdding these up:\n\nFor 4: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 times.\n\nFor 8: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78 times.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I add up 4's, I get 89 + 40 + 39 = 168, and 8's are 0 + 39 + 39 = 78. So, the difference would be 168 - 78 = 90. Hmm, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, earlier when I was counting the tens place for three-digit numbers, I think I made a mistake. Let me go back.\n\nFor the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has 10 possible tens digits (0-9), so for each, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, 3 hundreds digits * 10 = 30 for 4 and 30 for 8.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: Tens digits can be 0-8, which is 9 digits. So, for each, 4 appears once, so 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n- 4: 30 + 9 = 39\n\n- 8: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 40 and 39, but that was incorrect. So, I think I made a mistake there. So, correcting that:\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4: 39 times\n\n- 8: 39 times\n\nSimilarly, units place:\n\n- 4: 39 times\n\n- 8: 39 times\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n- 4: 89 times\n\n- 8: 0 times\n\nSo, total for 4: 89 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 167 times.\n\nTotal for 8: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78 times.\n\nWait, 89 + 39 + 39 is 167, right? 89 + 39 is 128, plus another 39 is 167.\n\nAnd 8's total is 78.\n\nSo, the difference is 167 - 78 = 89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90, but now it's 89. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let's recount the hundreds place. When the hundreds digit is 4, the numbers go from 400 to 488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each has 10 tens digits, so 3*10=30. Plus, for hundreds digit 4, 9 tens digits, so 9. So, 30+9=39 for both 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each has 10 tens digits, each with 10 units digits, so 3*10=30. Plus, for hundreds digit 4, 9 tens digits, each with 10 units digits, so 9*10=90? Wait, no, because the units digit is only 0-9, so for each combination, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each has 10 tens digits, each with 10 units digits, so 3*10*1=30 for 4 and 30 for 8. For hundreds digit 4, 9 tens digits, each with 10 units digits, so 9*1=9 for 4 and 9*1=9 for 8. So, total units place: 30+9=39 for both 4 and 8.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's total: 89 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 167\n\n8's total: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nDifference: 167 - 78 = 89\n\nWait, so the difference is 89. But earlier, I thought it was 90. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nWait, let me check the two-digit numbers again. Earlier, I thought that in two-digit numbers, 4 appears 19 times and 8 appears 19 times. Let me confirm that.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nUnits place: For each tens digit (1-9), 4 appears once, so 9 times. Similarly, 8 appears once for each tens digit, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total for two-digit numbers: 10+9=19 for 4, and 10+9=19 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nSingle-digit: 1 for 4, 1 for 8.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's total: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 167 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 + 167 = 187\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing the counts. Wait, no, the three-digit count is already including all three places, so the total for 4 is 167, and for 8 is 78, but wait, no, that's just the three-digit count. I need to add the single and two-digit counts.\n\nWait, no, the 167 and 78 are the totals for three-digit numbers. So, the total for all pages would be:\n\n4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (167) = 1 + 19 + 167 = 187\n\n8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, so the difference is 89. But earlier, I thought maybe 90, but now it's 89. So, the correct answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all counts again to be sure.\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n- 4: 1\n\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- 4: 19\n\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- 4: 167\n\n- 8: 78\n\nTotal:\n\n4: 1 + 19 + 167 = 187\n\n8: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we break down the page numbers into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers and count the occurrences of '4' and '8' in each category.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - '4' appears once.\n   - '8' appears once.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears 10 times (40-49), '8' appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** For each tens digit (1-9), '4' and '8' each appear once, totaling 9 times each.\n   - Total for two-digit pages: '4' appears 19 times, '8' appears 19 times.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears 89 times (400-488), '8' does not appear.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears 39 times, '8' appears 39 times.\n   - **Units place:** '4' appears 39 times, '8' appears 39 times.\n   - Total for three-digit pages: '4' appears 167 times, '8' appears 78 times.\n\n**Total counts:**\n- '4' appears 1 + 19 + 167 = 187 times.\n- '8' appears 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 times.\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should count the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract the two totals to find the difference. Let me start by counting the 4's. \n\nFirst, let's consider single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The only single-digit number with a 4 is 4 itself. So that's one 4. \n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10-99. Here, 4 can appear in the tens place or the ones place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. \n\nFor the ones place: The numbers are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the ones place. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that affect the count? Hmm, actually, when counting digits, each occurrence counts separately. So, 44 would contribute two 4's, but when I'm counting the ones place, I'm only looking at the ones digit. So, in the ones place, each of these numbers contributes one 4. So, 9 4's in the ones place. \n\nWait, but 40-49 have 10 4's in the tens place, and in the ones place, from 14, 24, ..., 94, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the ones place. So, total two-digit 4's would be 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nBut wait, 44 is in both the tens and ones place. So, does that mean I'm double-counting the 4 in 44? No, because when I count the tens place, I'm counting all the 4's in the tens digit, regardless of the ones digit, and when I count the ones place, I'm counting all the 4's in the ones digit, regardless of the tens digit. So, 44 contributes one 4 to the tens place count and one 4 to the ones place count, which is correct because it has two 4's. So, 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488. \n\nLet's break this down into hundreds, tens, and ones places. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nFor hundreds digit 1: 100-199. How many 4's are there in the hundreds place? None, because the hundreds digit is 1. \n\nFor hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, no 4's in the hundreds place. \n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Again, no 4's in the hundreds place. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's from the hundreds place. \n\nNow, let's consider the tens place in three-digit numbers. \n\nFor hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit can be 0-9. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's 14-19, 24-29, ..., 94-99. Wait, but since we're in 100-199, the tens digit can be 0-9, and for each, the ones digit is 0-9. So, for each hundreds group (100-199), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (140-149). Similarly, in 200-299, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (240-249), and so on. But since we're only going up to 488, in the hundreds digit 4 group (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times in each, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. \n\nWait, 100-199: tens digit 4 is 140-149, which is 10 numbers. \n\n200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers. \n\n300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers. \n\n400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, since 449 is within 488. So, that's 10 numbers. \n\nSo, total tens place 4's in three-digit numbers: 4 groups \u00d7 10 = 40. \n\nWait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, but 440-449 is within that, so yes, 10 numbers. So, 40 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers. \n\nNow, the ones place in three-digit numbers. \n\nAgain, for each hundreds group, the ones digit cycles 0-9. So, for each hundreds group, the ones digit 4 occurs once every 10 numbers. \n\nSo, for 100-199: 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 numbers. \n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 204, 214, ..., 294: 10 numbers. \n\n300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394: 10 numbers. \n\n400-488: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, how many is that? Let's see: starting at 404, adding 10 each time. 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 + 10 would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, only 9 numbers. \n\nSo, in the ones place, for 400-488, we have 9 4's in the ones place. \n\nTherefore, total ones place 4's in three-digit numbers: 3 groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) \u00d7 10 + 9 = 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 4's in the ones place, so that's 3\u00d710=30. Then, 400-488 has 9 4's in the ones place, so total 39. \n\nSo, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, ones place 39. Total three-digit 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, single-digit: 1 (correct).\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 40-49: 10 4's, ones place 14,24,...,94: 9 numbers, each contributing one 4, so 9. So, total two-digit 4's: 10 + 9 = 19. That's correct.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times in each group. So, 4 groups \u00d7 10 = 40. But wait, 400-488 is only up to 488, so does the tens digit 4 in 400-488 go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is within 488. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 10. So, 4 groups \u00d710=40. Correct.\n\n- Ones place: For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 4's in the ones place. So, 3\u00d710=30. For 400-488: 404,414,...,484. How many? Let's count: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's. So, total ones place 4's: 30 +9=39.\n\nSo, three-digit 4's: 89 +40 +39=168.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 +19 +168=188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. \n\nI think a similar approach is needed. \n\nSingle-digit page numbers: 1-9. The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself. So, 1 eight.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99. \n\nFor tens place: The numbers are 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nFor ones place: The numbers are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the ones place. But 88 has two 8's, so does that affect the count? Similar to before, when counting digits, each occurrence counts separately. So, in the ones place, each of these numbers contributes one 8, except 88, which contributes two, but when counting the ones place, we're only considering the ones digit. So, 18,28,...,98: 9 numbers, each with one 8 in the ones place. So, 9 8's in the ones place.\n\nWait, but 88 is in both the tens and ones place. So, when we count the tens place, 88 contributes one 8, and when we count the ones place, 88 contributes another 8. So, in total, 88 contributes two 8's, which is correct. So, the count is 10 (tens) +9 (ones)=19 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. For tens place: 80-89: 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. For ones place: 18,28,...,98: 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the ones place. So, total 10 +9=19 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nAgain, let's break it down into hundreds, tens, and ones places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The hundreds digit is 1, so no 8's here.\n\nFor hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 300-399. No 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, tens place in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nWait, let's check each group:\n\n100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers.\n\n200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers.\n\n300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers.\n\n400-488: 480-488: how many numbers? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 8's.\n\n- 200-299: 10 8's.\n\n- 300-399: 10 8's.\n\n- 400-488: 9 8's.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For each hundreds group, the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times, except for the last group, 400-488, where it occurs only 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 3\u00d710 +9=39.\n\nNow, the ones place in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor each hundreds group, the ones digit 8 occurs once every 10 numbers.\n\nSo, for 100-199: 108,118,...,198. That's 10 numbers.\n\n200-299: 208,218,...,298: 10 numbers.\n\n300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10 numbers.\n\n400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count: starting at 408, adding 10 each time. 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, ones place 8's:\n\n- 100-199:10\n\n- 200-299:10\n\n- 300-399:10\n\n- 400-488:9\n\nTotal ones place 8's: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total three-digit 8's: tens place 39 + ones place 39=78.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n\n- Two-digit:19\n\n- Three-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nSingle-digit:1.\n\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (ones)=19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Tens place:39\n\n- Ones place:39\n\nTotal three-digit 8's:39+39=78.\n\nSo, total 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only page 4: 1 occurrence.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: Pages 40-49: 10 occurrences.\n   - Ones place: Pages 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94: 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - Hundreds place: Pages 400-488: 89 occurrences.\n   - Tens place: Each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 40.\n   - Ones place: Each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 occurrences, and 400-488 contributes 9: 30 + 9 = 39.\n   - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\n**Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only page 8: 1 occurrence.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: Pages 80-89: 10 occurrences.\n   - Ones place: Pages 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98: 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - Tens place: Each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 occurrences, and 400-488 contributes 9: 30 + 9 = 39.\n   - Ones place: Each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 occurrences, and 400-488 contributes 9: 30 + 9 = 39.\n   - Total: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\n**Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Let's start with the units place because that's the simplest. For the units digit, how often does 4 and 8 appear? In the range from 1 to 488, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place every 10 numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So 4 and 8 each appear once every 10 numbers. Let me calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete group, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So for 48 groups, that's 48 times for 4 and 48 times for 8. Now, the remaining 8 numbers are 481 to 488. Let me list them: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Looking at the units digits here: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So in total, for the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so they're equal in the units place. Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0 (1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., 9 (90-99). So each tens digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. But since we have 488 pages, let's see how many complete hundreds there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). Let's calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in each part. First, the complete hundreds: each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So for 4, in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4 hundreds would contribute 4*10 = 40 times for 4. Similarly, for 8, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4*10 = 40 times for 8. Now, the remaining 88 pages (401-488). Let's look at the tens digits here. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in this range. Specifically, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: 1, 421-430: 2, 431-440: 3, 441-450: 4, 451-460: 5, 461-470: 6, 471-480: 7, 481-488: 8. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is only 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, but it's only 8 numbers, so does that affect the count? Let me think. The tens digit for 481-488 is 8, and since each tens digit group is 10 numbers, except the last one which is only 8. So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488?\n\nLooking at the tens digit in 401-488:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears once in the 441-450 group, which is 10 times. So that's 10 times for 4 in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages. Similarly, 8 appears in the 481-488 group, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of these 8 numbers. So that's 8 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in the 441-450 group, 441-450 is 10 numbers, so the tens digit is 4 for each of those, so that's 10 times. Similarly, in the 481-488 group, the tens digit is 8 for each of the 8 numbers, so that's 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total for the tens place:\n\n- 4: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from remaining) = 50 times\n- 8: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from remaining) = 48 times\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which doesn't count. From 100-488, the hundreds digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit 1 (100 times)\n- 200-299: hundreds digit 2 (100 times)\n- 300-399: hundreds digit 3 (100 times)\n- 400-488: hundreds digit 4 (89 times, since 488-400+1=89)\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nSo, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit 1, so no 4 or 8 here.\n- 200-299: hundreds digit 2, so no 4 or 8 here.\n- 300-399: hundreds digit 3, so no 4 or 8 here.\n- 400-488: hundreds digit 4, so 4 appears 89 times here.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, from 1-488, the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for the hundreds place:\n\n- 4: 89 times\n- 8: 0 times\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again because 4's are more than 8's, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8, but in the tens place, 4 had 50 and 8 had 48, and in the hundreds place, 4 had 89 and 8 had 0.\n\nSo adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nSo, 188 - 97 = 91. So, 4's are printed 91 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make an off-by-one error.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Similarly for 8: 48 times in the full decades and once in the remaining 8, so 49 times. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40 times.\n\nIn the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in the 441-450 range, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So total 40 + 10 = 50 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place:\n\nIn each full hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40 times.\n\nIn the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in the 481-488 range, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So total 40 + 8 = 48 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-488, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times for 4. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nSo, 4's are printed 91 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just think again: when counting the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so that's 89 times. Correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in 401-488, I correctly identified that 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, that seems correct.\n\nUnits place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times, so no difference there.\n\nTens place: 50 for 4, 48 for 8, so a difference of 2.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8, so a difference of 89.\n\nTotal difference: 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488: 48 full groups and 8 extra numbers.\n   - 4 appears 48 times in full groups and once in the extra (484), totaling 49.\n   - 8 appears 48 times in full groups and once in the extra (488), totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 4 appears 10 times per hundred, 4 hundreds contribute 40 times.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n   - Total for 4: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - 8 appears 10 times per hundred, 4 hundreds contribute 40 times.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages, 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total for 8: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I can separate the counting based on the number of digits in the page numbers. Let me think about each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48, and the same for 8's. But wait, we also have those 8 extra numbers. From 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's is 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Hmm, so in the units place, they are equal. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and similarly for 8 (80-89). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see: from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-490, but wait, we only go up to 488. So, the tens digit in 481-488 is 8. So, in the tens place, for the 401-488 range, how many times does 4 appear? Well, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. But wait, 440 is 440, so that's correct. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in this range. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, but 480 is 480, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in this partial hundred. Therefore, total for the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 8's in the hundreds place are 0. \n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place. \n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nIn the units place, I had 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, plus the extra 8 numbers where 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 48 + 1 = 49 each. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place, each full hundred contributes 10 times each for 4 and 8. So, 4 full hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 40 +10 =50 for 4's and 40 +9=49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's.\n\nAdding them up: 49 +50 +89=188 for 4's, and 49 +49 +0=98 for 8's. The difference is 188 -98=90. \n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can count the occurrences of each digit in each position separately. Let's see, the positions are units, tens, and hundreds. So, for each position (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, from 1 to 480, that's 48 blocks, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the 49th block, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more (at 484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: in each block of 10, 8 appears once, so 48 times from 1-480. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more at 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so in the units place, 8 appears at 488, which is correct. So, units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every block of 100 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and same for 8. So, 4 complete hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 times each. Now, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) have tens digits from 0 to 8. Let's see: from 401-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, tens digit is 1; ... up to 480-488, tens digit is 8. So, in the 401-488 range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Only in 440-449, which is 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, how about 8 in the tens place? That would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), but the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 times. Wait, but from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 times? Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 440-449, and 8 appears 9 times in 480-488.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 4*10 (from the four hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times 4. And 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times 8. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's:40+9=49.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; 400-488, it's 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place:89, and 8's:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 488/10=48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in units place, so 48 each, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units, and 488 has an 8. So, 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in tens place, so 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. 440-449 is 10 times 4, and 480-488 is 9 times 8. So, 4's:40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - Each block contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8 in the units place: 48 each.\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Total complete hundreds in 488 pages: 4.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place: 40 each.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 440-449 contributes 10 occurrences of 4.\n     - 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences of 8.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, no 4 or 8.\n   - Pages 100-399: hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3; no 4 or 8.\n   - Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total Occurrences:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract the two totals to find the difference. Let me try to approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For the units digit, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 also appears once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears in 4, and 8 appears in 8. Similarly, in 11-20, 4 appears in 14, and 8 in 18. So, for each ten numbers, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, since the book has 488 pages, let's see how many complete blocks of ten there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of ten and an additional 8 pages (481-488). \n\nIn each of these 48 blocks, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. Now, let's look at the remaining 8 pages from 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in these, the digit 8 appears once (in 488), and the digit 4 does not appear because the units digits are 1 to 8, and 4 isn't in 481-488. Wait, actually, 484 would have a 4 in the units place, right? Wait, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in 484, the units digit is 4, so that's another 4. So, in the units place for the last 8 pages, we have one 4 (in 484) and one 8 (in 488). So, for the units place, the total 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal, both at 49.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. In the tens digit, the digit 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block for 8 in the tens place is 480-488.\n\nLet me calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-100, there are 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Similarly, from 101-200, it's another 10, and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, let's see how many such blocks there are.\n\nFrom 1-100: 10 numbers with 4 in tens place.\nFrom 101-200: 10 numbers (140-149).\nFrom 201-300: 10 numbers (240-249).\nFrom 301-400: 10 numbers (340-349).\nFrom 401-488: 10 numbers (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, total for 4 in tens place is 10 * 5 = 50. Wait, but 400-499 would have 4 in the hundreds place, but we're only considering up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, for 8 in the tens place. Similarly, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for 8 in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers.\nFrom 101-200: 180-189: 10.\nFrom 201-300: 280-289:10.\nFrom 301-400:380-389:10.\nFrom 401-488:480-488:9.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:50, 8's in tens place:49. So, 4's are more by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. For 8 in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place:89, 8's:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's recount the 4's in the units place. Earlier, I thought units place had 49 4's, but let's verify.\n\nIn the units place, for each ten numbers, 4 appears once. From 1-480, there are 48 blocks of ten, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 48 +1=49, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: same logic, 48 blocks of ten, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in 488, which is the last page, so another 8 in units place. So, 48 +1=49, correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: as calculated earlier, 50 times. Tens place for 8's:49 times.\n\nHundreds place: 4's:89 times, 8's:0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place, correct.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the number of 4's in the hundreds place is indeed 89.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in hundreds place: since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0, correct.\n\nAnother way to think about this: the total number of 4's is the sum of their occurrences in each digit place.\n\nSimilarly for 8's.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it as for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nWait, for units digit:\n\nTotal number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10)*1 + (if the last digit is >=d, then 1 else 0). But since d is 4 and 8, which are less than 10, this applies.\n\nSo, for units digit:\n\nFor 4's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488's units digit is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488's units digit is 8, which is >=8, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nThe formula is floor((N)/100)*10 + (if the last two digits of N are >=d*10, then (last two digits -d*10 +1) else 0).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many complete hundreds are there, and then the partial hundred.\n\nSo, for tens digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place:\n\nEach hundred block contributes 10 times (e.g., 40-49 in 1-100, 140-149 in 101-200, etc.).\n\nNumber of complete hundreds in 488: 4 (since 4*100=400, and 5*100=500>488). So, 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages (400-488). The tens digit in 400-488 is 0-8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 400-488? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nEach hundred block contributes 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages (400-488). The tens digit here can be 0-8. So, the numbers where tens digit is 8 are 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 9.\n\nThus, total 8's in tens place:40 +9=49.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as calculated earlier.\n\nNumber of times 8 appears: since the book ends at 488, there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again to confirm.\n\nStarting with units digit:\n\n- For 4's: as before, 49.\n- For 8's:49.\n\nTens digit:\n\n- 4's:50\n- 8's:49\n\nHundreds digit:\n\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by considering each digit place separately and ensuring I haven't missed anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula for counting digit occurrences. For a given digit d in a specific position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet me recall the formula for counting the number of times a digit d appears in the k-th position (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) up to a number N.\n\nThe formula is:\n\ncount = higher * 10^k + current + 1 if current > d\ncount = higher * 10^k + d + 1 if current == d\ncount = higher * 10^k + 1 if current < d\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use a standard digit counting method.\n\nLet me try to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor 4's:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488 /10)=48\nRemainder:488 %10=8\nIf remainder >=4, add 1, else add 0.\nSince 8>=4, add 1.\nTotal 4's in units:48*1 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:48\nRemainder:8\nIf remainder >=8, add 1, else 0.\nSo, 48*1 +1=49.\n\nSame as before.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100: floor(488 /100)=4\nRemainder:488 %100=88\nThe current digit in tens place is 8 (since 88 is the remainder, which is 8 in tens place).\n\nNow, for digit d=4:\n\nIf current digit >4: then count += (current digit -4) * 10^(k-1)\nIf current digit ==4: count += (current digit) *10^(k-1) +1\nIf current digit <4: count += (current digit +1) *10^(k-1)\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula:\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), split the number into higher, current, and lower parts.\n\nLet me try for 4's in tens place:\n\nN=488\n\nWe're looking at the tens place, so k=2 (since units is k=1, tens k=2, hundreds k=3).\n\nHigher part: floor(488 /100)=4\nCurrent digit: floor((488 %100)/10)=8\nLower part:488 %10=8\n\nNow, for digit d=4:\n\nIf current digit >4: count += (higher +1) *10^(k-1)\nIf current digit ==4: count += higher *10^(k-1) + (lower +1)\nIf current digit <4: count += higher *10^(k-1)\n\nBut wait, I think I might have misremembered the formula. Let me try to think again.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the number of times digit d appears in the tens place up to N is:\n\ncount = higher *10 + (if current >d then 10 else 0) + ... ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times 4 appears in the tens place:\n\nEach time the tens digit cycles from 0-9, 4 appears once every 100 numbers. So, for each complete hundred, 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n\nNumber of complete hundreds in 488:4 (since 4*100=400 <=488 <500).\n\nSo, 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remaining part is 88 (488-400=88). So, in the tens place, from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nThe tens digit cycles from 0-8 in 400-488. So, 4 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449. That's 10 numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 numbers (400-488). The tens digit here goes from 0-8. So, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place:40 +9=49.\n\nSame as before.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89).\n\nFor 8's:\n\nThe hundreds digit would be 8 from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no pages with hundreds digit 8.\n\nSo, 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nI think this is correct.

    "text": " Maybe I should tackle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each place one by one for both digits.\n\nFirst, let me think about the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's would each be equal to the number of complete sets of 10 in the total pages. But wait, 488 isn't a multiple of 10, so I need to adjust for the remaining pages beyond the last complete set of 10.\n\nSo, let's calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place.\n\nNow, let's check the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488). The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, there's one more 4 (at 484) and one more 8 (at 488). So, adding these, the units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's. Wait, that seems correct because in the last 8 pages, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, total units place: 49 each.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me double-check. The units digits in the incomplete set from 481 to 488 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 is page 484, which has a 4 in the units place. Similarly, 488 has an 8. So, yes, that's one more 4 and one more 8. So, units place gives 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range. So, for each of these 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place from the complete hundreds.\n\nNow, let's look at the incomplete hundred from 401 to 488. The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 times. So, in the incomplete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place contributions: 40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +9=49 for 8's.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for the 4's in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8's, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, yes, 10 and 9.\n\nTherefore, total tens place: 4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+9=49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nHow about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, from 1-488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because the book only has 488 pages. The hundreds digits go up to 4 (400-488). So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's = 49 +50 +89= 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's=49 +49 +0=98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 488 pages. Each 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8 in the units place. 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. So, 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, units place gives 48+1=49 4's and 48+1=49 8's.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 4's. 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 8's. So, total tens place: 40+10=50 4's and 40+9=49 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, 89 4's. 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just verify the counts again to be sure.\n\nUnits place:\n- 488 pages. Each 10 pages have one 4 and one 8. 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete sets, 48 4's and 48 8's. The last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, units place:49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. 4 hundreds: 4*10=40 each.\n- 401-488: Tens digits 0-8.\n  - 4's in tens place: 440-449: 10 pages.\n  - 8's in tens place:480-488:9 pages.\n- So, tens place:40+10=50 4's and 40+9=49 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages with hundreds digit 4.\n- 8's: 0.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 pages contain 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 each.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's.\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can count the occurrences of 4 and 8 separately and then find the difference between them. Let me think about each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. But wait, does this hold true all the way up to 488? Let me check. The total number of pages is 488, so the last set of ten would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, in the units place, for each full set of ten pages, both 4 and 8 appear once. But in the incomplete set (480-488), the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, how many full sets of ten are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the number of complete tens is 48 sets (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets). Each of these sets contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in the incomplete set (480-488), as I thought, there's one 4 and one 8. So, adding those, units place gives us 49 fours and 49 eights. Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the 48th set? Maybe I'm complicating it. Let me approach it differently. From 1 to 488, the number of times the units digit is 4 is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units place across all page numbers. Similarly for 8. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of ten, which is 48, each contributing one 4, plus any additional 4s in the incomplete group. Since 488 is the last page, the incomplete group is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's one more 4. So, total 4s in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8s in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place gives 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times. But again, we need to consider up to 488. So, how many hundreds are there? From 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range. So, for each complete hundred, we have 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights. Now, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears once (in 440-449) and the digit 8 appears once (in 480-488). Wait, no, that's not quite right. The tens digit in 401-488 is from 0 to 8, so for each ten's place, it's 40-49, 50-59, etc., but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digits are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, but wait, 450 is beyond 488? No, 450 is less than 488, so yes, 441-450 is within 401-488. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers (481-488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480 is part of the 480-489 range, but 480 is included in the 400s. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: in the 400s, the tens digit can be 0-9, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers (440-449), but wait, 440 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 fours in the tens place. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480 is included, so that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, total fours in tens place: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 10 in the incomplete hundred, so 50 fours. Similarly, eights in tens place: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in the incomplete hundred, so 49 eights. Wait, but wait, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, adding to the previous 40 each, we get 50 fours and 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, eights in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total eights from total fours: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each ten contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- Number of tens: 48 full tens (1-480) and then 481-488 is 8 numbers, but in units place, each ten has one 4 and one 8. So, 48 full tens \u00d7 1 each = 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units: 49 fours and 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 4 hundreds (1-400) \u00d7 10 each = 40 fours and 40 eights.\n- In 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 numbers) and 8 appears in 480-488 (9 numbers).\n- So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours and 40 + 9 = 49 eights. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 never appears. So, 0.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze the occurrence of the digits 4 and 8 in each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of ten consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of ten in 488 pages, contributing 48 fours and 48 eights.\n   - The remaining pages (481-488) add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contains ten occurrences of each digit in the tens place. Thus, each hundred contributes ten fours and ten eights.\n   - With four complete hundreds (1-400), we have 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - In the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears ten times (440-449), and 8 appears nine times (480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to 488.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\n**Summing Up:**\n- **Total fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **Total eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each position, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. In the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of 10 numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0, so 0 appears once, and 1 appears once, etc. But wait, actually, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers. But since we're starting from 1, maybe the first set is a bit different. Wait, no, because page 1 is 1, page 2 is 2, up to page 10, which is 10. So, in the units place, from 1 to 10, digits 1-9 appear once, and 0 appears once. But in the next set, 11-20, the units digits go from 1 to 0 again, so each digit appears once in the units place every 10 numbers. So, for the units place, the number of times a digit appears is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in the total number of pages, plus any extra in the incomplete group.\n\nWait, but the total number of pages is 488, so let's see. For the units place, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in each complete group of 10, each digit from 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for each complete group, 4 appears once and 8 appears once in the units place. So, for 48 complete groups, that's 48 times for 4 and 48 times for 8 in the units place. Then, in the incomplete group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place: 48 +1 = 49 for 4, and 48 +1 = 49 for 8. So, same count in units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99), each appearing 10 times. So, in each set of 100 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, our total pages are 488, so how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages (401-488). Wait, actually, 400 is page 400, so 401-488 is 88 pages. So, in each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each complete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times for 4 and 4*10=40 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the incomplete hundred is 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, the tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nFirst, the tens digit in 401-409 is 0, so no 4 or 8 there.\n\nIn 410-419, the tens digit is 1.\n\n420-429: tens digit 2.\n\n430-439: tens digit 3.\n\n440-449: tens digit 4.\n\n450-459: tens digit 5.\n\n460-469: tens digit 6.\n\n470-479: tens digit 7.\n\n480-488: tens digit 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place in 401-488, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). Wait, no, 480 is the first page, and 488 is the last, so that's 9 pages: 480 to 488 inclusive. Wait, actually, 488 - 480 +1 = 9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So, in the tens place in the incomplete hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8.\n\nWait, let me check that again. For 4 in the tens place, in the complete hundreds, it's 4*10=40. In the incomplete hundred, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 times. So, 40+10=50 for 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place, in the complete hundreds, it's 4*10=40. In the incomplete hundred, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, 40+9=49 for 8 in the tens place.\n\nOkay, so in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 100 times.\n\n200-299: hundreds digit is 2, 100 times.\n\n300-399: hundreds digit is 3, 100 times.\n\n400-488: hundreds digit is 4, 89 times (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages).\n\nWait, actually, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? 89 times.\n\nHow about 8? Well, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the hundreds digits go up to 4. The next would be 500, but we only go up to 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight. So, 48 each. Then, in the incomplete group (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units: 48+1=49 for 4, 48+1=49 for 8. That's correct.\n\nTens place: Complete hundreds (1-400) have 4 sets, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights. So, 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 in 480-488 (9 times). So, 40+10=50 fours, 40+9=49 eights. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 doesn't appear. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's: 49+49+0=98. Difference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 times. That's correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: when calculating the tens place in 401-488, I considered 440-449 as 10 pages, which is correct because 449 is included. But 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, 9 times for 8 in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nI think that's accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Complete groups of 10: 48 groups (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Incomplete group (481-488): 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Complete groups of 100: 4 groups (1-400).\n   - Incomplete group (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Let me start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in every block of 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit, say 4, appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then seeing how many times that digit occurs. Similarly for 8. But wait, the total number of pages is 488, which isn't a multiple of 10, so I might have a partial block at the end. Let me think. The total number of complete blocks of 10 pages is 48 full blocks (since 48*10=480), and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, for the units digit, in each complete block, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total for units place: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so in the units place, they're equal. Now, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 10-19, the tens digit is 1; 20-29, it's 2; and so on up to 90-99, where it's 9. So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds do we have? Let's see: 400-499 would be a hundred, but we only go up to 488. So, up to page 488, we have four complete hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. Wait, no, 1-99 is the first hundred, 100-199 the second, 200-299 the third, and 300-399 the fourth. Then from 400-488, which is another 89 pages, so that's not a complete hundred. So, for each of the four complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8. So, 4 appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place from the complete hundreds. Similarly, 8 appears 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the incomplete hundred from 400-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit in this range is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, 2 for 420-429, 3 for 430-439, 4 for 440-449, 5 for 450-459, 6 for 460-469, 7 for 470-479, 8 for 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 pages, right? So, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 would be pages 440 to 449, which is 10 pages, but since the book goes up to 488, that's fine. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place from 440-449. So, total for 4 in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times. For 8 in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. Now, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for three-digit numbers, i.e., pages 100-488. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for each hundred block, the hundreds digit is constant. So, for 100-199, hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; 400-488, it's 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. So, summarizing: For 4's, in the hundreds place: 89 times, tens place: 50 times, units place: 49 times. Total 4's: 89 + 50 + 49 = 188 times. For 8's, hundreds place: 0 times, tens place: 49 times, units place: 49 times. Total 8's: 0 + 49 + 49 = 98 times. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10: 48 (up to page 480).\n   - 48 blocks \u00d7 1 occurrence = 48 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - Last 8 pages (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (up to page 399).\n   - 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 occurrences = 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - Pages 400-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 100-488: 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188.\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 49 (tens) + 49 (units) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can count the occurrences of each digit separately and then subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Let me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once in the units place every 10 numbers. Similarly, from 11 to 20, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 again. So, for each complete set of 10 numbers, each digit appears once in the units place. \n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. \n\nFor the hundreds place, it's a bit different because the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only considering page numbers starting from 1, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. \n\nNow, let me structure this systematically. I'll count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's:\n\n1. Units place:\n   - For each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - How many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times from the complete blocks.\n   - Now, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once more in the units place here.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - For the tens place, each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - So, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times.\n   - Similarly, from 101-200, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, another 10 times.\n   - Continuing this way, from 201-300, 240-249: 10 times.\n   - From 301-400, 340-349: 10 times.\n   - Now, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n   - So, how many hundreds are there? From 1-400, we have four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place: 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Then, from 401-488, another 10 4's in the tens place (440-449).\n   - So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - As I thought earlier, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is not that high. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, from 401-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 88 pages (since 488 - 400 = 88, but including both endpoints, it's 89 pages). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. \n\nBut when counting the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, 4's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus one more in 484, so 49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, that seems high. Wait, but 488 is a 3-digit number, and each digit place is being considered. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcounting. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should consider each digit place separately without overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a formula for each digit place. For example, for the units place, the number of times a digit d appears is floor(n/10) * 1 + (if the remainder is >= d, then 1 else 0). Similarly for tens and hundreds places, but scaled by 100 and 1000 respectively.\n\nWait, let me try that approach.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 10) = 48, and since the remainder is 8, which is >= 4, so add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48, and the remainder is 8, which is equal to 8, so add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so both 4's and 8's appear 49 times in the units place? That seems possible.\n\nNow, for the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 100) = 4, which is the number of complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 times for the digit in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the remainder after dividing 488 by 100 is 88. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the range 40-49 in the current hundred. So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, add 10. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nfloor(488 / 100) = 4, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThe remainder is 88, so in the tens place, the digit 8 appears in 80-89. But since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89 in each hundred. So, in 1-100: 80-89, 10 times.\n\nIn 101-200: 180-189, 10 times.\n\nIn 201-300: 280-289, 10 times.\n\nIn 301-400: 380-389, 10 times.\n\nIn 401-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the last hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 4 * 10 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 (from the last partial hundred) = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 10 in the last hundred, but actually, it's only 9 because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nNumber of 8's in hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no pages with hundreds digit 8. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me verify this again because 188 4's and 98 8's seems like a big difference. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, perhaps I overcounted the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me think again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's list them:\n\n- 40-49: 10 times\n- 140-149: 10 times\n- 240-249: 10 times\n- 340-349: 10 times\n- 440-449: 10 times\n\nWait, that's five sets of 10, so 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place, as calculated, 49 times.\n\nSo, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nIn the units place: 49 times.\n\nIn the tens place: 49 times.\n\nIn the hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot, but maybe that's correct. Let me check with a smaller number to see if my method works.\n\nFor example, let's take a book with 100 pages. How many 4's and 8's would there be?\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's: floor(100/10)=10, and remainder 0, which is <4, so 10.\n\n8's: floor(100/10)=10, and remainder 0, which is <8, so 10.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's: floor(100/100)=1, so 1*10=10.\n\n8's: floor(100/100)=1, so 1*10=10.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: 0 (since 100 is the last page, hundreds digit is 1, so 4 doesn't appear).\n\n8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 10 +10 +0=20.\n\nTotal 8's: 10 +10 +0=20.\n\nDifference: 0. That makes sense because in 1-100, 4's and 8's should appear equally.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier method, for 100 pages:\n\nUnits place 4's: floor(100/10)=10, remainder 0 <4, so 10.\n\nTens place 4's: floor(100/100)=1, so 10.\n\nHundreds place 4's: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 20.\n\nSame for 8's: 20.\n\nSo, the method works for 100 pages.\n\nNow, let's try 200 pages.\n\nUnits place 4's: floor(200/10)=20, remainder 0 <4, so 20.\n\nTens place 4's: floor(200/100)=2, so 2*10=20.\n\nHundreds place 4's: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 20+20=40.\n\nUnits place 8's: floor(200/10)=20, remainder 0 <8, so 20.\n\nTens place 8's: floor(200/100)=2, so 2*10=20.\n\nHundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 20+20=40.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nThat also makes sense.\n\nNow, let's try 400 pages.\n\nUnits place 4's: floor(400/10)=40, remainder 0 <4, so 40.\n\nTens place 4's: floor(400/100)=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nHundreds place 4's: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 80.\n\nUnits place 8's: floor(400/10)=40, remainder 0 <8, so 40.\n\nTens place 8's: floor(400/100)=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nHundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 80.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nSo, up to 400 pages, 4's and 8's are equal. But from 401-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's where the 4's get an extra count.\n\nSo, in 488 pages, the 4's have an extra 89 in the hundreds place, which is why the total 4's are higher.\n\nTherefore, my calculation seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again in 401-488. So, in the tens place, 8's would be in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, in the tens place, 8's are 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 8's are 49, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Each block of 10 numbers contributes one '4'. There are 48 full blocks (480 pages), contributing 48 '4's. The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more '4' in the units place. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each hundred contributes 10 '4's in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, contributing 40 '4's. From 401-488, the tens digit '4' appears in 440-449, adding 10 '4's. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place, contributing 89 '4's.\n\n   **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Each block of 10 contributes one '8'. There are 48 full blocks, contributing 48 '8's. The last 8 pages add one more '8'. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each hundred contributes 10 '8's. From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, contributing 40 '8's. From 401-488, the tens digit '8' appears in 480-488, contributing 9 '8's. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no pages with '8' in the hundreds place.\n\n   **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra numbers. In each group of 10, the units digit is 4 once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 4 once (484). So total units digit 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, for the units digit 8's: same logic. Each group of 10 has one 8, so 48 groups give 48 times. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, so that's one more 8. So total units digit 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. Now, moving on to the tens place. In the tens digit, every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So total tens digit 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Now for the tens digit 8's: Similarly, every 100 numbers, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, 4 complete hundreds give 4*10=40. In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So total tens digit 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. For the hundreds digit 8, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds digit 8's are 0. Now, let me sum up all the 4's and 8's. Total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occur once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete groups of 10 (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occur 10 times every 100 numbers. 4 complete hundreds give 40, plus 10 in 440-449, totaling 50.\n   - **8's:** Occur 10 times every 100 numbers. 4 complete hundreds give 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** From 400-488, 89 times.\n   - **8's:** Never occurs, so 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should approach this by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's think about the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. So, for example, in the numbers 1-10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. Similarly, in 11-20, the units digits go from 1-0 again, so each digit appears once. So, for the units place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be the total number of groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 full groups, giving 48 fours. But wait, 488 is not a multiple of 10, so the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place, we have 48 full groups (each contributing one 4) plus an extra 4 in 484. Wait, no, 484 is part of the 480-488 group. So, actually, in each group of 10, the 4 appears once, and in the last partial group, if the units digit reaches 4, it appears once more. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times from the full groups, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: same logic. Each group of 10 contributes one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, giving 48 eights. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems the same, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check. For the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. Hmm, maybe that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each set of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digits go from 0 (for 0-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred). So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears once in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place 8's: in each full hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89 in each hundred). So, 4 * 10 = 40 times. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 only once in 480-488? Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. Wait, no, 480 is 480, so the tens digit is 8, and 481-488 have tens digit 8 as well. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, so far, in the tens place, 4's are more by 1.\n\nNow, let's look at the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, the hundreds digit 8 would be in 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 4's: 48 full groups of 10 (48*10=480, so up to 480) gives 48 fours. Then, 481-488: units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once in 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n- 8's: Similarly, 48 full groups (480) gives 48 eights. Then, 481-488: units digit 8 appears once in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) gives 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n- 8's: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. So, 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n- 8's: None, since 800-899 isn't included. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But wait, 480 is included in 401-488, right? So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, that's 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Maybe I can think of the total number of digits printed and see if the counts make sense, but that might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can recount the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another thought: When counting the units place, I considered up to 488, which is correct. Similarly, for the tens place, I considered up to 488, so 401-488 is correct. So, I think my counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- **4's:** Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4. There are 48 full groups (480 numbers) and one more 4 in 484. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n- **8's:** Similarly, each group of 10 contributes one 8. There are 48 full groups and one more 8 in 488. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- **4's:** Each hundred has 10 numbers with a tens digit of 4. Four full hundreds (1-400) give 40, plus 10 in 440-449. Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n- **8's:** Each hundred has 10 numbers with a tens digit of 8. Four full hundreds give 40, plus 9 in 480-488. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- **4's:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n- **8's:** No pages have an 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should approach this by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place and then sum them up. Let me start by considering the units place. For every block of 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So, for the units place, I can calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages and then see how many 4's and 8's that gives me. Then, I can check if there's a partial block left and count those as well. Similarly, for the tens place, each block of 100 pages has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49) and 10 where it's 8 (80-89). So, for the tens place, I can calculate how many full hundreds are in 488 and then see how many 4's and 8's that gives. Again, check for partial hundreds. For the hundreds place, since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book doesn't have any pages from 800 onwards. So, for 8's, the hundreds place contributes 0. Now, let me structure this:\n\n1. Units place:\n   - Total pages: 488\n   - Number of complete blocks of 10: 48 (since 48*10=480)\n   - Each block contributes 1 four and 1 eight, so 48 fours and 48 eights.\n   - Remaining pages: 488 - 480 = 8 pages (481-488)\n   - In these 8 pages, the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n   - So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because in the remaining 8 pages, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, the units place total is 48 fours + 1 = 49 fours, and 48 eights +1 =49 eights.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - Each block of 100 pages has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place (40-49 and 80-89).\n   - Number of complete hundreds in 488: 4 (since 4*100=400)\n   - So, 4 blocks * 10 fours = 40 fours, 4 blocks *10 eights=40 eights.\n   - Now, check the remaining pages after 400: 488 - 400 = 88 pages (401-488)\n   - In these 88 pages, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n   - The tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, our range is 401-488. So, 440-449 is within this range, so that's 10 fours.\n   - Similarly, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times (since 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8).\n   - So, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages: 10 fours and 9 eights.\n   - So, total tens place: 40 +10 =50 fours, 40 +9=49 eights.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - As I thought earlier, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 fours.\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if there were pages from 800-888, but since the book ends at 488, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal fours = 49 +50 +89 = 188\n\nFor eights:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal eights =49 +49 +0 =98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more fours are printed than eights. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 -98 =90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), I considered that the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours. And for 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, I had 48 fours from the 48 blocks, plus 1 from the remaining 8 pages, totaling 49 fours. Similarly for eights.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 blocks give 40 fours, plus 10 more from 440-449, totaling 50 fours. For eights, 4 blocks give 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n\nEights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 =98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90\n\nHmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " Maybe I should separate the counts based on the number of digits, like single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers, and then count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place separately. Let's start with single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the number 4 appears once, and the number 8 appears once. So, so far, 4's count is 1 and 8's count is 1. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place and how many times they appear in the units place. Let's start with the tens place. For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9. So, for the tens digit being 4, the numbers would be 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for the tens digit being 8, the numbers would be 80 to 89, which is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, for the units place in two-digit numbers, the digit can be 0 to 9, and this repeats for each ten's group. So, for each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 14, 24, etc.), and the same for 8 (e.g., 18, 28, etc.). There are 9 ten's groups (10-19 up to 90-99), so the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and the same for 8. So, adding up the two-digit numbers: 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. Now, let's move on to three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because we have three places: hundreds, tens, and units. Let's handle each place separately. First, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book ends at 488. So, for hundreds digit 4, the numbers are from 400 to 488. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), so the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, for 8 in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. Next, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0 to 9, and this varies for each hundred. Let's break it down by each hundred group: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. For each hundred group, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every ten numbers. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), same for 8 (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.). But we have to be careful with the last hundred group, 400-488, because it doesn't go up to 499. Let's calculate for each hundred:\n\n1. 100-199: The tens digit 4 appears in 140-149 (10 numbers), so 4 appears 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in 180-189.\n2. 200-299: Same as above, 4 appears 10 times (240-249), and 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n3. 300-399: Same, 4 appears 10 times (340-349), and 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n4. 400-488: Here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, for the tens digit 4, the numbers would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For the tens digit 8, the numbers would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up the tens place across all hundreds:\n\n- For 4: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n- For 8: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. In 400-488, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times for 8 in the tens place in that group. So, total for 8 in the tens place is 39.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens group. So, for each hundred group, each digit (including 4 and 8) appears 10 times in the units place per hundred. Let's break it down:\n\n1. 100-199: For each tens group (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the units digit 4 appears once per ten, so 10 times in total. Same for 8.\n2. Similarly, 200-299: 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n3. 300-399: 10 times each.\n4. 400-488: Now, this is a bit tricky because 400-488 doesn't cover a full hundred. Let's see: from 400 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. How many complete tens are there? From 400-409, 410-419, ..., up to 480-488. So, the tens go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the end). For each of these tens groups, the units digit 4 appears once, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. Let's see: from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? Let's count the tens groups:\n\n- 400-409: units 4 appears once (404)\n- 410-419: 414\n- 420-429: 424\n- 430-439: 434\n- 440-449: 444\n- 450-459: 454\n- 460-469: 464\n- 470-479: 474\n- 480-488: 484\n\nWait, but 480-488 is only up to 488, so 484 is within that range. So, that's 9 times for 4 in the units place in 400-488. Similarly, for 8 in the units place:\n\n- 400-409: 408\n- 410-419: 418\n- 420-429: 428\n- 430-439: 438\n- 440-449: 448\n- 450-459: 458\n- 460-469: 468\n- 470-479: 478\n- 480-488: 488\n\nSo, that's 9 times for 8 in the units place in 400-488.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? So, how many complete tens groups are there? From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens group, the units digit cycles 0-9, except the last one, which only goes up to 8. So, for each of the first 9 tens groups (0-8), the units digit 4 appears once, so 9 times. Similarly, for 8 in the units place, it appears once in each tens group, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but in the 400-488 range, the units digit 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times as well. So, in the units place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- For 4: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n- For 8: Similarly, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but that seems off because earlier I thought the units digit would be 10 times per hundred, but in the last hundred, it's 9 times. So, yes, 39 times for both 4 and 8 in the units place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place, and 400-488 has 9. So, 10+10+10+9=39 for 4. Similarly for 8, same calculation: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. So, in the units place, 4 appears 39 times, and 8 appears 39 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences for 4 and 8 across all digit places.\n\nFirst, let's total for 4:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Wait, in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds, tens, and units places are separate, so I should add them up.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 times (as calculated earlier)\n- Units place: 39 times\n\nSo, total for 4 in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39 times\n- Units place: 39 times\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right because earlier in the tens place, I think I might have miscalculated. Let me go back.\n\nWait, in the tens place for three-digit numbers, for 4, it's 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times. For 8, it's 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times.\n\nSo, for 4 in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nFor 8 in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4 appears 188 times, and 8 appears 98 times. The question is asking how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me go through each step again.\n\nFirst, single-digit:\n\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89)\n- Units place: 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94), same for 8: 9 times\nTotal for two-digit: 4: 10 + 9 = 19, 8: 10 + 9 = 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n- Tens place:\n  - 4 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 3*10=30\n  - In 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449)\n  - Total for 4: 30 + 10 = 40\n  - For 8:\n    - 10 times in each of the first three hundreds, so 3*10=30\n    - In 400-488, 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n    - Total for 8: 30 + 9 = 39\n- Units place:\n  - For 4: in each hundred, 10 times, so 3*10=30\n  - In 400-488, 4 appears 9 times (as in 404,414,...,484)\n  - Total for 4: 30 + 9 = 39\n  - For 8: similarly, 3*10=30 in first three hundreds, and 9 in 400-488, total 39\n\nSo, three-digit totals:\n\n- 4: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nAdding up all occurrences:\n\n- 4: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n- 8: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once.\n   - 8 appears once.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94), 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - Total for two-digit pages: 4 appears 19 times, 8 appears 19 times.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - Total for three-digit pages: 4 appears 168 times, 8 appears 78 times.\n\n4. **Total occurrences:**\n   - 4: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - 8: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1-0, and 4 appears once (at page 4) and 8 appears once (at page 8). Similarly, from 11 to 20, the units digits again cycle through 1-0, so 4 at 14 and 8 at 18. This pattern continues. So, for each set of 10 pages, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. So, in each of the 48 full sets, we have 1 four and 1 eight in the units place. That gives 48 fours and 48 eights from the units place. Now, the extra 8 pages (481-488) will have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in these, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the total fours from units place are 48 + 1 = 49, and eights are 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but that seems like they are equal, but maybe I made a mistake because 488 is included. Let me check: pages 481-488 are 8 pages, so units digits 1-8. So yes, 4 and 8 each appear once. So units place gives 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each group of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each tens digit from 0 to 9. So, for the tens digit being 4, it appears from 40-49 in each hundred, which is 10 times. Similarly, for the tens digit being 8, it's from 80-89, which is another 10 times. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, for each hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4*10=40 eights. Now, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) would have the tens digit from 0-8. Wait, no, 401-488 is actually 88 pages, but the tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 401-488 includes 440-449 as part of it, right? So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 pages. Similarly, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, that might be a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 pages. The tens digit cycles every 10 pages. So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-489). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's 10 fours in the tens place. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). So, in the tens place, for the 401-488 range, we have 10 fours and 9 eights. So, adding to the earlier counts: total fours in tens place are 4*10 (from each hundred) + 10 = 50 fours. Eights in tens place are 4*10 (from each hundred) + 9 = 49 eights. So, total fours from tens place: 50, eights: 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. The hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear at all because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, in the hundreds place, fours appear 89 times and eights 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit position.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 full sets of 10 pages each, giving 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) add 1 four (484) and 1 eight (488). So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens digit. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449) and 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). So, tens place adds 10 fours and 9 eights. So, total tens place: 40+10=50 fours, 40+9=49 eights. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 fours. No eights in hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nAdding them up: fours: 49 + 50 +89= 188. Eights: 49 +49 +0=98. Difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the 401-488 range again for the tens digit. So, 401-488 is 88 pages. The tens digits in this range go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. For the tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, yes, 10 fours and 9 eights. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to think about the hundreds digit. From 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so 0 fours and 0 eights. From 100-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so no fours or eights in the hundreds place. From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nI think this is correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we determine that there are 188 fours and 98 eights. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Let me start by considering each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. For each position, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. \n\nFirst, let's handle the units place. For any range of numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, for each position, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every block of 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly for the digit 8. So, the number of times a digit appears in the tens place is calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 100 and then multiplying by 10, plus any additional counts from the remaining pages beyond the last full hundred.\n\nFor the hundreds place, it's a bit different because the hundreds digit doesn't change as frequently. Each digit from 1 to 9 appears 100 times in the hundreds place for every block of 1000 numbers. But since our book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit will only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the hundreds place, we can calculate how many times each digit appears by considering how many full hundreds are in 488 and then the remaining pages.\n\nLet me structure this systematically.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor units digit:\n- The number of times 4 appears: We can calculate how many complete groups of 10 are in 488. That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48 with a remainder of 8. Each complete group contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), how many 4's are there in the units place? Looking at 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more 4. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. Each group contributes one 8, so 48 times. In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's one more 8. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check that. When I have 488 pages, the last page is 488. So, when I'm looking at the units digit, the last group is 481-488, which includes 488. So, for 8's, it's correct that there's an extra 8 in the units place. But for 4's, the units digit in 484 is 4, so that's correct. So, both 4's and 8's have 49 occurrences in the units place. So, so far, the count is 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nFor tens digit:\n- The number of times 4 appears: Each full hundred (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, for each hundred, that's 10 occurrences. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, that's 4 full hundreds. So, 4 times 10 is 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place from the full hundreds. Now, we have 88 pages beyond the 400th page, so from 401 to 488. In this range, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490. But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place beyond the 400th page? Let's see, the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, but wait, 440-449 would be pages 440 to 449. But our range is up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's another 10 occurrences. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: Each full hundred has 10 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40 occurrences. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's: 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n- The number of times 4 appears: The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nWait, but wait, 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let me add them up: 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 488 pages, so units digit cycles every 10. 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have 484 as the only 4 in units place, and 488 as the only 8 in units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4's: Each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place. 488 / 100 = 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, total 50. Correct.\n- For 8's: Each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place. 4 full hundreds give 40. In the last partial hundred, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n- 8's: None, since 800 is beyond 488. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for 8's? From 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences, so 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each 10 consecutive numbers contribute one '4'. There are 48 full groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '4's. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more '4'. Total: 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, each 10 numbers contribute one '8'. The remaining 8 numbers include 488, adding 1 more '8'. Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each 100 numbers contribute 10 '4's in the tens place. Four full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 '4's. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10 '4's. Total: 50.\n   - **8's:** Each 100 numbers contribute 10 '8's. Four full hundreds contribute 40 '8's. The last partial hundred includes 480-488, adding 9 '8's. Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Pages 400-488 have 89 numbers, each contributing a '4'. Total: 89.\n   - **8's:** No pages have '8' in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference. Let me start by considering each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. But I need to check how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 more pages (481-488). In each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units digit, 4's and 8's each appear 48 times. But wait, I also have those extra 8 pages beyond 480, which are 481 to 488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, for the units place, total 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), up to 9 (90-99). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, since the book has 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, each hundred has 100 pages, so 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. So, that's four full hundreds and a partial hundred. \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. So, for four hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. Now, for the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in this partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, in the partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nWait, but 480 is page 480, and 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred. Therefore, total for the tens place: 4's are 40 (from four full hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50. 8's are 40 (from four full hundreds) + 9 (from partial) = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's are more by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many times does 4 appear here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. What about 8? The hundreds digit is 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all in this book. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up all the digits:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have 484 and 488, so adding one more 4 and one more 8. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. Four full hundreds: 4*10=40 each. Then, the partial hundred (401-488) has 440-449, which is 10 4's, and 480-488, which is 9 8's. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nAdding up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 for 4's. 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 for 8's. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and 8 additional pages (481-488).\n   - 4's: 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49\n   - 8's: 48 + 1 (from 488) = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (400 pages) and a partial hundred (401-488).\n   - 4's: 4*10 + 10 (from 440-449) = 50\n   - 8's: 4*10 + 9 (from 480-488) = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each position one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's think about the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 also appears once. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4), and 8 appears once (page 8). Similarly, from 11-20, 14 has a 4, and 18 has an 8. So, in each block of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). So, in the units place, for each digit (4 and 8), we can calculate the number of times they appear as follows:\n\nIn each of the 48 complete blocks, each digit appears 48 times? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, each digit appears once per block, so for 48 blocks, each digit appears 48 times in the units place. Then, we have the extra 8 pages (481-488). Let me check the units digits in 481-488: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial block, the units digit 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). Therefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from partial block) = 49. Similarly, the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, each complete block of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 blocks contribute 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 for both. So, no difference in units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each block of 100, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for the digit 4, in the tens place, it appears 10 times in each 100-number block (e.g., 40-49). Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n\nNow, how many complete 100-number blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488.\n\nSo, in each of these 4 complete blocks, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the same for 8. So, 4 blocks * 10 = 40 times each. Now, let's look at the partial block from 401-488. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: 440-449 would have the tens digit as 4, which is 10 times. Similarly, 480-488 has the tens digit as 8, which is 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages. Let me break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nWait, but 480 is included in the 480-488 range, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488.\n\nWait, but 480 is part of the 480-488 range, so the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear in 401-488? It's from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). So, in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place overall:\n\n- 4 appears 4 blocks *10 =40, plus 10 in the partial block, total 50 times.\n- 8 appears 4 blocks *10 =40, plus 9 in the partial block, total 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 -49 =1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-400, each block of 100 has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 40 each. Then, from 401-488, as I broke down, 440-449 gives 10 4's, and 480-488 gives 9 8's. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49. So, yes, 50-49=1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1-9 appears in a block of 100 numbers. For example, 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, and so on.\n\nIn our case, the book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digits possible are 1,2,3,4. Let's see:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit 1\n- 200-299: hundreds digit 2\n- 300-399: hundreds digit 3\n- 400-488: hundreds digit 4\n\nSo, how many times does each hundreds digit appear?\n\n- 1: 100 times (100-199)\n- 2: 100 times (200-299)\n- 3: 100 times (300-399)\n- 4: 89 times (400-488) because 488-400+1=89 pages.\n\nWait, 400 to 488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, let's check if 8 appears in the hundreds place. Since 800 would be the next, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times.\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, the difference here is 89 -0=89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with hundreds digit 4. So, yes, 89 times. And since 800 is beyond 488, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total number of 4's and 8's across all digit positions.\n\nFirst, let's calculate total 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's =49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nNow, total 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's=49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that's 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier in the tens place, I thought the difference was 1, and in the hundreds place, 89, so total difference would be 1 +89=90. That matches.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Each block of 10 contributes 1 4 and 1 8.\n- 488 pages: 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1, so 48 each.\n- Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units:48+1=49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each block of 100 contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 complete blocks (1-400) give 40 each.\n- The last partial block (401-488) has tens digits:\n  - 440-449:10 4's\n  - 480-488:9 8's\n- So, tens:40+10=50 for 4's, 40+9=49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488:89 4's\n- No 8's in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49(units)+49(tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When considering the tens place in the partial block, from 401-488, I broke it down into:\n\n- 440-449:10 4's in the tens place\n- 480-488:9 8's in the tens place\n\nBut wait, is that accurate? Let's see:\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for the last one, which might be shorter.\n\nWait, no. Actually, from 401-488, the tens digits go as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers, since 488-481+1=8)\n\nWait, so from 481-488, that's 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 9.\n\nWait, that's a mistake I made earlier. So, in the partial block, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 9. So, let me correct that.\n\nSo, in the partial block (401-488):\n\n- 440-449: tens digit 4 appears 10 times\n- 480-488: tens digit 8 appears 8 times (since 480 is included, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Wait, that's 9 numbers. So, 480 is part of the 480-488 range, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the partial block, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 8. So, my initial calculation was correct.\n\nWait, but when I broke down 401-488, I thought of 481-488 as 8 numbers, but that's incorrect because 480 is included. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times the tens digit 8.\n\nSo, in the partial block, 4's in tens place:10, 8's in tens place:9.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\n- 4's:40 +10=50\n- 8's:40 +9=49\n\nSo, the difference in tens place is 1.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's:89, 8's:0, so difference 89.\n\nSo, total difference is 1 +89=90.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with hundreds digit 4. So, 89 times. And since the book doesn't go beyond 488, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49(units) +50(tens) +89(hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49(units) +49(tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just think if there's any other way this could be calculated, maybe using a formula or a different approach to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n\nIn any range from 1 to N, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is equal to (N // 10) + (1 if d <= (N % 10) else 0). But since we're dealing with digits 4 and 8, which are both less than 10, we can use this formula.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of blocks. As we did before, each block of 10 contributes 1 to each digit in the units place. So, for 488 pages, that's 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, and then the remaining 8 pages, which contribute 1 each for 4 and 8.\n\nSo, units:48*1 +1=49 for both.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each block of 100 contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 blocks of 100 contribute 40 each. Then, the remaining 88 pages (from 401-488) have their tens digits contributing 10 times for 4 (440-449) and 9 times for 8 (480-488). So, total 50 for 4 and 49 for 8.\n\nFor the hundreds place, as before, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a formula for each digit position:\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's = floor(488/10) + (1 if 4 <= (488 % 10) else 0) = 48 + (1 if 4 <=8 else 0)=48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: floor(488/10) + (1 if 8 <= (488 %10) else 0)=48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's = floor(488/100)*10 + (if (488 %100) >=40 and (488%100) <50, then (488%100 -40 +1) else 0).\n\nWait, let's compute this.\n\nfloor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, 488%100=88.\n\nSince 88 >=40 and 88 <50? No, 88 is greater than 50. So, the number of 4's in the tens place beyond the 400 is 0, because 488 is beyond 449.\n\nWait, but earlier we saw that in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, perhaps the formula is not directly applicable here.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for the tens digit is:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N is:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10\n\nremainder = N % 100\n\nif d < (remainder // 10):\n    count +=10\nelif d == (remainder //10):\n    count += (remainder %10) +1\nelse:\n    count +=0\n\nWait, let me test this formula.\n\nFor digit 4 in tens place up to 488:\n\nN=488\n\ncount = (488//100)*10 =4*10=40\n\nremainder=488%100=88\n\nNow, d=4, so d < (remainder//10)=8? Yes, 4 <8.\n\nSo, count +=10, making total 50.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in tens place:\n\ncount =4*10=40\n\nremainder=88\n\nd=8, which is equal to (remainder//10)=8.\n\nSo, count += (88%10)+1=8+1=9, making total 49.\n\nSo, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, using this formula, we get 50 4's and 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place, the formula would be:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in the hundreds place from 1 to N is:\n\ncount = (N // 1000) * 100\n\nremainder = N % 1000\n\nif d < (remainder //100):\n    count +=100\nelif d == (remainder //100):\n    count += (remainder %100) +1\nelse:\n    count +=0\n\nBut in our case, N=488, so N//1000=0, remainder=488.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\nd=4, remainder//100=4.\n\nSo, since d==4, count += (488%100)+1=88+1=89.\n\nFor digit 8:\n\nd=8, remainder//100=4, which is less than 8, so count +=0.\n\nSo, number of 8's in hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, using the formula, we get 89 4's and 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49(units) +50(tens) +89(hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49(units) +49(tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think this confirms my earlier calculation. So, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 complete blocks (480 pages) contribute 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (page 484) and one 8 (page 488).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - 4 complete blocks (400 pages) contribute 40 each.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) contribute 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's.\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference**: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can approach this by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start with the units place because that might be simpler. \n\nFor the units place, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once, right? Like 4, 14, 24, etc. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, etc. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48, and the number of 8's would also be 48. But wait, I also have the extra 8 numbers from 481 to 488. In those, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's another 8 in the units place (which is 488). So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, so far, in the units place, 4's are 48, 8's are 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times, right? For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 80-89, which is another 10 numbers. So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and then an extra 88 numbers (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens place has 10 4's and 10 8's. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's. Now, in the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. From 401-409, the tens digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's there. From 410-419, the tens digit is 1, so no. Similarly, 420-429: 2; 430-439: 3; 440-449: 4. So, from 440-449, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. Then, 450-459: 5; 460-469:6; 470-479:7; 480-488:8. So, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, in the tens place for the extra 88 numbers, we have 10 4's and 9 8's. \n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50. Total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 48\n  - 8's: 49\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 50\n  - 8's: 49\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n\nNow, adding them all up:\n\nTotal 4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 4's and 49 8's. Then in the tens place, 50 4's and 49 8's. Then in the hundreds place, 89 4's and 0 8's. So, adding up:\n\n4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me think again about the tens place in the extra 88 numbers. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. For 8's, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 9 8's in the tens place for the extra 88 numbers. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so 89 4's, and no 8's in the hundreds place because 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, I think the calculation is correct. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** 48 times (once every 10 numbers, 48 complete blocks)\n   - **8's:** 49 times (once every 10 numbers, plus one extra in 481-488)\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** 50 times (40 per 100 numbers, plus 10 in 440-449)\n   - **8's:** 49 times (40 per 100 numbers, plus 9 in 480-488)\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** 89 times (all numbers 400-488)\n   - **8's:** 0 times\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n- **8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 98 = 89\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each position one by one.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for example, in 1-10, 4 is in 4, and 8 is in 8. Similarly, in 11-20, 4 is in 14, and 8 is in 18. So, for each 10 numbers, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each full set, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Therefore, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this last set, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding that, the total for units place would be 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. Wait, that seems conflicting because 488 is included, so maybe I should check that again.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is the last page, so the last page is 488, which is included in the 481-488 set. So, in that set, units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, the units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's. Hmm, but that seems like they are equal in units place. So, maybe the difference comes from the tens or hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in 40-49, and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in 80-89. But since our book goes up to 488, which is less than 500, we have to consider how many full hundreds we have. From 1-400, there are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these hundreds has a set where the tens digit is 4 and another where it's 8. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for four hundreds, that would be 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 4 * 10 = 40 8's in the tens place. Now, what about the last partial hundred, 401-488? The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, for 8, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but that's only 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 489, but since we're stopping at 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in all those numbers, so it's 9 times. Wait, no, that's not correct. The tens digit is 8 in all numbers from 480 to 489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, adding that to the previous counts, the total for the tens place would be 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (440-449) = 50 4's, and 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (480-488) = 49 8's. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is only 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place are zero.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each position.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting with units place: I thought 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets and 8 extra. Each set contributes one 4 and one 8. So, 48 * 1 = 48 for each, and then in the last set (481-488), units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, total units for 4: 48 + 1 = 49, same for 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times per hundred, 8 appears 10 times per hundred. There are four full hundreds (1-400), so 4 * 10 = 40 for each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens for 4: 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8: 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 never appears here.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the units place, for 488 pages, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is actually floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, maybe I should use a formula for counting digits.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is given by:\n\nunits = (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >= d else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\ntens = (N // 100) * 10 + max(0, (N % 100 - d * 10 + 1))\n\nWait, perhaps using a formula would help avoid mistakes.\n\nLet me try using a formula for each digit position.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4.\n\nUnits place for 4:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place from 1 to 488.\n\nUsing the formula: units = (488 // 10) + (1 if 488 % 10 >= 4 else 0)\n\n488 // 10 = 48, 488 % 10 = 8, which is >=4, so units = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place.\n\nFormula: tens = (488 // 100) * 10 + max(0, (488 % 100 - 4 * 10 + 1))\n\n488 // 100 = 4, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\n488 % 100 = 88, so 88 - 40 + 1 = 49. Since 49 > 0, tens = 40 + 49 = 89? Wait, that can't be right because from 1-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 10 each, so 50 times. Wait, but according to the formula, it's giving 89, which is wrong. So, maybe I applied the formula incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for a specific digit. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I should break it down differently. The number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N is calculated as:\n\ntens = (N // 100) * 10 + min(max(N % 100 - d * 10 + 1, 0), 10)\n\nSo, for d=4, N=488:\n\ntens = (488 // 100) * 10 + min(max(488 % 100 - 4*10 +1, 0),10)\n\n488 // 100 = 4, so 4*10=40.\n\n488 % 100 = 88.\n\n88 - 40 +1 = 49.\n\nmin(max(49,0),10) = min(49,10) = 10.\n\nSo, total tens = 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in tens place:\n\ntens = (488 // 100)*10 + min(max(488%100 - 8*10 +1,0),10)\n\n488//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\n488%100=88.\n\n88 - 80 +1=9.\n\nmin(max(9,0),10)=9.\n\nSo, total tens for 8: 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 4:\n\nFrom 1-488, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor 8 in hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 times.\n\nSo, total for 4:\n\nUnits:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total=49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal for 8:\n\nUnits:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total=49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, so the calculation seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4 would contribute a lot, but 89 seems correct because 400-488 is 89 pages. Let me confirm:\n\n488 - 400 +1 =89. Yes, correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nUnits place both 49 times.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: For each group of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. Now, how many such groups are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of ten and then an extra 8 pages. Wait, but maybe I should think differently. Let me see: for the units place, the number of times 4 appears is equal to the number of times 4 is in the units digit across all page numbers. Similarly for 8.\n\nSo, for units place:\n- The number of 4's is the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488.\n- Similarly, the number of 8's is the number of times 8 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488.\n\nEach full set of ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) contributes exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, how many full sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 full sets and then 8 more pages (481-488). \n\nIn each full set of ten, there's one 4 and one 8. So, for 48 full sets, that's 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Now, for the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the units digit 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times.\n\nHmm, so maybe the difference comes from the tens and hundreds places. Let me check the tens place next.\n\nFor the tens place, the digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly for 8 in 80-89. So, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Wait, no, 400 is the end of the fourth hundred, and then we have 401-488. So, four full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's from the tens place in the full hundreds.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining pages after 400, which are 401-488. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in the 440-449 range, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 4's. Similarly, does 8 appear in the tens place in this range? Yes, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but since 488 is the end, that's 9 pages (480-488), but wait, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 times? Wait, no, actually, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for each of those, so that's 9 times. Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, adding that to the previous counts:\n\nTotal tens place 4's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50.\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, that's a difference of 1 in favor of 4's.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), so 89 times. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, adding them all up:\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations, especially the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 401-488, I considered 440-449 as 10 4's, which is correct, and 480-488 as 9 8's, which is correct because 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, tens place 4's: 50, 8's: 49.\n\nUnits place: 49 each.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 1 in the tens place, but overall, it's 90. Hmm, that seems correct, but maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when I calculated the units place, I had 48 full sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That's correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 times) and 8 for 480-488 (9 times). So, tens place 4's: 40 +10=50; 8's:40 +9=49. So, that's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's, and 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but 90 seems like a lot. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcounting in the hundreds place. Wait, the hundreds digit is only 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so that's 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by considering each digit place separately and using a formula. For example, in the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\nnumber_of_times = (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nBut I think I did that correctly earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I should use a different approach. Let me try to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor units digit 4:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place up to 488:\n\nEach 10 numbers contribute one 4. So, 488 // 10 = 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, check the remainder: 488 % 10 = 8. Since 8 >=4, add 1 more. So, total 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8 in units place: 488 //10=48, and 488%10=8 >=8, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor tens digit 4:\n\nEach 100 numbers contribute 10 times 4 in the tens place. So, 488 // 100 =4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, the remainder is 88. So, in the remaining 88 numbers, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly for 8 in tens place:\n\n488 //100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nRemainder:88. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor hundreds digit 4:\n\nOnly from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor hundreds digit 8:\n\nSince 488 <800, it never appears, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When I calculated the hundreds place, I considered 400-488 as 89 pages, which is correct because 488-400+1=89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 50 4's and 49 8's, so that's a difference of 1.\n\nIn the units place, both have 49, so no difference.\n\nSo, overall, the difference is 89 (hundreds) +1 (tens) =90.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that the hundreds place contributed 89 more 4's, and the tens place contributed 1 more 4, so total 90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nCalculating total 4's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I might have made a mistake earlier when I thought the difference was 1, but no, the hundreds place contributes a significant number of 4's, so the difference is indeed 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Determine the range of page numbers:** The book has pages from 1 to 488.\n\n2. **Count occurrences of each digit in each place (units, tens, hundreds):**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - For 4: Each group of 10 pages contributes one 4. There are 48 full groups (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488). In the units place, 4 appears once in the extra pages (page 484). Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n     - For 8: Similarly, 8 appears once in the extra pages (page 488). Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - For 4: Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (400 pages) contributing 40. In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), 440-449 contributes another 10. Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n     - For 8: Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The remaining 88 pages include 480-488, contributing 9 8's. Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - For 4: Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n     - For 8: No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n3. **Sum the counts:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n4. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should count the number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference between them.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 include a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with an 8. So, actually, the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So, that would be 48 times. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 480, the units digit cycles every 10, so 480/10 = 48, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears once every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: from 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll check each place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, that's 49 times. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 480, units digit cycles 48 times, so 48 eights, and then from 481 to 488, the units digit goes up to 8, so that's one more 8 at 488. So, total 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. Let's count how many full ranges we have. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges. The first four are full, each contributing 10 eights, and the last one is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 4 ranges \u00d7 10 + 1 range \u00d7 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me verify: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49+49=98. That seems right.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I calculated units for 8, I thought from 1 to 480, there are 48 eights, and then 488 adds one more, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, I had 5 ranges, but the last one was only 9 numbers, so 49 in total.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 187. So, the number of 4's is 187, and 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the units place, I had 48. But from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The first number is 4, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Wait, that would mean 49 times. But earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, if the last number with 4 in the units place is 484, which is 4 + 10*(48) = 484, so that's 49 numbers: from n=1 to n=49, so 49 times. But wait, 484 is within 488, so that's correct. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I said 48. So, let me correct that.\n\nSo, units place for 4's: 49 times.\n\nTens place for 4's: earlier I thought 50 times, but let me check again. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d710=50. Since 440-449 is within 488, that's correct. So, 50 times.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, 49+50=99, plus 89=188. So, 188 fours.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, let's check again.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 49 times, as before.\n\nTens place for 8's: 49 times, as before.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me go through each digit place again carefully.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, how many times? The first 4 is at 4, then 14, 24,...,484. So, how many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d710=50. Since 440-449 is within 488, that's correct. So, 50 times.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. From 1 to 488, the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many? The first 8 is at 8, then 18,28,...,488. So, the last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 times.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last range has 9 numbers (480-488). So, total is 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again. Maybe I should use a formula or a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to count digits is to consider each digit place separately and calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nFor a number from 1 to N, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is floor(N/10) + (1 if the units digit of N is >=d else 0). Similarly for tens, hundreds, etc.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to use a more systematic approach.\n\nLet me try to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place from 1 to 488.\n\nThe number of complete groups of 10 is floor(488/10)=48. Each group contributes one 4. So, 48. Then, check the remainder: 488 mod 10=8. Since 8 >=4, we add 1 more. So, total 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place. Each group of 100 contributes 10 times the digit in the tens place. So, number of complete groups of 100 is floor(488/100)=4. Each contributes 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, the remaining 88 numbers: from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, but wait, in the last partial group, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 within 400-488, which is 10 numbers: 400-409. Wait, but 400-409 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nWait, but 488 is 488, so from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 more, making it 50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's in hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48 groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, check remainder: 488 mod 10=8. Since 8 >=8, add 1. So, total 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 8's in tens place: floor(488/100)=4 complete groups, each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, the remaining 88 numbers: from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 more. So, total 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 8's in hundreds place: from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49+0=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach. Maybe list out the counts for each digit place again.\n\nAnother way: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor 4: as above, 49 times.\n\nFor 8: 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4: 50 times.\n\nFor 8: 49 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4:89 times.\n\nFor 8:0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. From 1 to 488, this occurs 49 times (including 484).\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, '4' appears 89 times.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** '8' appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (including 488).\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times (with the last range being 480-488, contributing 9 times).\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's appear since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's minus number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each place one by one for both digits.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the same for 8. But wait, since we're starting from 1, the first block is 1-10, so the units digit for 4 appears at 4, and for 8 at 8. Then, each subsequent block of 10 will have another 4 and 8 in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages (481-488). So, in each complete block, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Now, the partial block from 481 to 488: let's list the units digits here. 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial block, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding to the units place, total 4's from units are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so so far, units place gives equal numbers of 4's and 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every block of 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times, and 8 for 80-89, also 10 times. So, in each block of 100, we have 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Now, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488. Let's calculate the 4's and 8's in the tens place for each.\n\nFor each complete block of 100, we have 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks would give 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's. Now, the partial block from 401-488. Let's see the tens digits here. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). Wait, no, actually, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: 1, ..., 481-488: 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, in 401-488, 440-449 is within this range. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but our range ends at 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488), so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. Wait, but wait, 480 is included in 401-488, so the tens digit 8 starts at 480, which is part of the partial block. So, in the partial block, tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) +10=50, and 8's: 40 +9=49. So, in the tens place, we have 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's correct. The tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages because 480 is included, and 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 times. So, yes, 50 4's and 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. The hundreds digit 8 never appears because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488 and doesn't go up to 500 or beyond. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place calculation. When I was counting the tens digit 8 in the partial block, I thought it was 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers. But wait, 480 is included in the range 401-488, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's correct. So, 9 times for 8's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, the partial block from 481-488 includes 484 and 488, so that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let me calculate the total number of 4's and 8's again.\n\nUnits place:\n- 48 complete blocks of 10: 48*1=48 4's and 48 8's.\n- Partial block: 481-488: 484 and 488, so 1 4 and 1 8.\nTotal units:48+1=49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 complete blocks of 100: 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's.\n- Partial block 401-488: 440-449 is 10 4's, and 480-488 is 9 8's.\nTotal tens:40+10=50 4's, 40+9=49 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires comparing the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 complete blocks (480 pages) give 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete blocks (400 pages) give 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The partial block 401-488 includes 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's think about the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once every 10 pages. But wait, in our case, the page numbers start at 1, so the first page is 1, and the units digits go from 1 to 9, then 0 in 10, then 1 in 11, and so on. Wait, no, actually, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often over a span of 10 numbers. But since our pages start at 1, the first page is 1, so the first units digit is 1, then 2, up to 9, then 0 at 10, then 1 at 11, and so on. So, for every 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. But since we're starting at 1, the first 0 in the units place is at page 10, so from 1 to 10, the digits 1-9 and 0. So, for each digit in the units place, how many times does it appear? Let me think.\n\nThe total number of pages is 488, so let's see how many complete groups of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra pages. So, in each complete group of 10, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for 48 complete groups, each digit appears 48 times in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 pages, which would be 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, digits 1 through 8 each appear once more, and 9 and 0 don't appear in the units place in these last 8 pages.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me correct that. The last 8 pages would be 481 to 488, so their units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, digits 1 through 8 each get an extra count in the units place, but 9 and 0 don't. So, for the units place, the number of times each digit appears is 48 times for digits 0-9, plus an additional count for digits 1-8. So, for digits 1-8, they appear 49 times, and for digits 9 and 0, they appear 48 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because in the first group (1-10), the units digits are 1-9 and 0, so each digit from 0-9 appears once. Then, for each subsequent group of 10, the same applies. So, up to page 480, which is 48 groups of 10, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages, the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each get an extra count, making it 49 times for digits 1-8, and 48 times for 0 and 9.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place? For each digit d from 0 to 9, the number of times it appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus one if the digit is less than or equal to the remaining pages beyond the last complete decade.\n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, for each digit d from 0 to 9, the count is 48 times, plus 1 if d <= 8, because the remaining 8 pages have units digits from 1 to 8. So, digits 1-8 appear 49 times each, and 9 and 0 appear 48 times each in the units place.\n\nWait, but 0 appears in the units place only when the page number is a multiple of 10, like 10,20,...,480. So, from 1 to 480, that's 48 times, and from 481 to 488, 0 doesn't appear in the units place. So, 0 appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, 9 appears in the units place at 9,19,29,...,479. How many times is that? Let's see, from 1 to 480, every 10 pages, 9 appears once. So, 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, 9 doesn't appear in the units place, so 9 appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nSo, for the units place, digits 1-8 each appear 49 times, and 0 and 9 appear 48 times. So, for 4's and 8's, in the units place, 4 appears 49 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nBut since our book ends at 488, which is less than 500, we have four hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so let's see.\n\nWait, from 1 to 99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, each appearing 10 times. From 100-199, the tens digit again cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times. Similarly, 200-299, same thing. 300-399, same. Then, 400-488: the tens digit goes from 0-8, because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, for 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, each digit from 0-8 appears 9 times in the tens place (since 488 is the last page, and 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, but let me check that.\n\nWait, actually, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit d from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? For d=0: pages 400-409, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For d=1: 410-419, 10 pages. Similarly, up to d=7: 470-479, 10 pages. Then, d=8: 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and digit 8 appears 9 times in the 400-488 range.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of times each digit appears in the tens place across all page numbers.\n\nFirst, from 1-99: each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 10 times each.\n\nFrom 100-199: same, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 200-299: same, 10 times each.\n\nFrom 300-399: same, 10 times each.\n\nFrom 400-488: as above, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for each digit in the tens place:\n\nDigits 0-7: 10 (from 1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times each.\n\nWait, no, wait. From 400-488, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times. So, for digits 0-7, total in tens place is 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times each.\n\nFor digit 8 in the tens place: from 1-99, 10 times; 100-199, 10 times; 200-299, 10 times; 300-399, 10 times; and from 400-488, 9 times. So total 10+10+10+10+9=49 times.\n\nSimilarly, digit 9 in the tens place: from 1-99, 10 times; from 100-199, 10 times; from 200-299, 10 times; from 300-399, 10 times; and from 400-488, 0 times, since 490-499 would be the 9 in the tens place, but we only go up to 488. So, digit 9 in the tens place appears 40 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 1-99, the tens digit 9 appears in 90-99, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 100-199, the tens digit 9 appears in 190-199, which is 10 times. Same for 200-299, 290-299, 10 times. 300-399, 390-399, 10 times. But in 400-488, the tens digit 9 would be in 490-499, but since we stop at 488, digit 9 in the tens place doesn't appear at all in 400-488. So, total for digit 9 in the tens place is 10+10+10+10=40 times.\n\nSo, summarizing the tens place:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 50 times each.\n- Digit 8: 49 times.\n- Digit 9: 40 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. From 1-99, there is no hundreds digit, so it's effectively 0, but since we're only considering the hundreds place, maybe we can consider it as 0, but in reality, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit printed. So, perhaps we should count the hundreds digit only from page 100 onwards.\n\nSo, from 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times.\n\nFrom 200-299, hundreds digit is 2, appearing 100 times.\n\nFrom 300-399, hundreds digit is 3, appearing 100 times.\n\nFrom 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times (since 400-488 is 89 pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nWait, let me check that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 1: 100 times (100-199)\n- Digit 2: 100 times (200-299)\n- Digit 3: 100 times (300-399)\n- Digit 4: 89 times (400-488)\n- Digits 5-9: 0 times, since we don't go beyond 488.\n\nDigits 0: Well, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so 0 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 1: 100\n- 2: 100\n- 3: 100\n- 4: 89\n- 5-9: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up the total number of times each digit appears in all three places: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4.\n\nIn the units place, digit 4 appears 49 times.\n\nIn the tens place, digit 4 appears 50 times (since in the tens place, digits 0-7 each appear 50 times, so 4 is included in that).\n\nIn the hundreds place, digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, total for digit 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nNow, for digit 8.\n\nIn the units place, digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nIn the tens place, digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nIn the hundreds place, digit 8 appears 0 times, since the hundreds digits go up to 4.\n\nSo, total for digit 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, digit 8 doesn't appear because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4, and 4 only goes up to 488, so no 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, digit 8 appears:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 98 times.\n\nSo, digit 4 appears 188 times, and digit 8 appears 98 times.\n\nThe question is, how many more 4's are printed than 8's? So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 4 appears 49 times.\n- 8 appears 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4 appears 50 times.\n- 8 appears 49 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times.\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me check each part again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, plus an extra 1 for digits 1-8, making it 49 times each. So, 4 and 8 each appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-99: each digit 0-9 appears 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-199: same, 10 times each.\n\nFrom 200-299: same.\n\nFrom 300-399: same.\n\nFrom 400-488: digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times.\n\nFor digit 8 in the tens place: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nDigit 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nDigit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, 4 appears 188 times, 8 appears 98 times, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I feel like the hundreds place for 4 is contributing a lot. Let me think: 400-488 is 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times, which is correct. So, that's a significant contribution.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits printed. Let's see, pages 1-9: 9 pages, 1 digit each: 9 digits.\n\nPages 10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each: 180 digits.\n\nPages 100-488: 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 pages, 3 digits each: 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, total digits from 1-488: 1356.\n\nNow, if digit 4 appears 188 times, and digit 8 appears 98 times, the difference is 90, which would mean that 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For each digit d, the number of times it appears is floor(488 / 10) + (1 if d <= (488 % 10) else 0).\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so for units digit:\n\nEach digit d from 0-9 appears 48 times, plus 1 if d <= 8.\n\nSo, digits 0-8 appear 49 times, and 9 appears 48 times.\n\nThus, 4 and 8 each appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the tens place is calculated as:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, for 488 pages, how many hundreds do we have? 4 full hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n\nIn each full hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nIn the partial hundred (400-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 9 or 10 times?\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages. Let's see, from 400-409: 10 pages, tens digit 0.\n\n410-419: 10 pages, tens digit 1.\n\n...\n\n470-479: 10 pages, tens digit 7.\n\n480-488: 9 pages, tens digit 8.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for each digit in the tens place:\n\nDigits 0-7: 4 full hundreds * 10 + 10 = 50 times each.\n\nDigit 8: 4 full hundreds *10 +9= 49 times.\n\nDigit 9: 4 full hundreds *10 +0=40 times.\n\nSo, yes, as before.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for 4: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89: 188.\n\nFor 8: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears equally in the units place every 10 pages.\n   - Total pages: 488.\n   - Number of complete decades: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Remainder: 8 pages (481-488).\n   - Each digit 0-8 appears once more in the units place of the remaining 8 pages.\n   - Thus, digits 1-8 appear 49 times each, and 0 and 9 appear 48 times each.\n   - **Count for '4' and '8' in units place:** 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n   - For 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and a partial hundred (400-488).\n   - In each full hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - In the partial hundred (400-488), digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and digit 8 appears 9 times.\n   - **Count for '4' in tens place:** 50 times.\n   - **Count for '8' in tens place:** 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - Pages 1-99: No hundreds digit.\n   - Pages 100-199: Digit '1' appears 100 times.\n   - Pages 200-299: Digit '2' appears 100 times.\n   - Pages 300-399: Digit '3' appears 100 times.\n   - Pages 400-488: Digit '4' appears 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - **Count for '4' in hundreds place:** 89 times.\n   - **Count for '8' in hundreds place:** 0 times.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Digit '4':** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times.\n   - **Digit '8':** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (count of '4') - 98 (count of '8') = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should count the occurrences of each digit separately and then subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, both 4 and 8 will appear once every 10 numbers. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4), and 8 appears once (page 8). Similarly, from 11-20, 14 and 18 would each have a 4 and an 8 in the units place. So, for each group of 10 pages, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. \n\nNow, how many such groups are there? Since the book has 488 pages, that's 48 full groups of 10 pages (from 1-480) and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, for the units digit, in the 48 full groups, there are 48 instances of 4 and 48 instances of 8. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, page 484 has a 4 in the units place, and page 488 has an 8. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place. Therefore, total units digit 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49, and units digit 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, the count is equal for both 4 and 8.\n\nNext, I should check the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each set of 100 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in pages 40-49 (10 times) and 8 in pages 80-89 (10 times). So, in each 100 pages, there are 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. \n\nNow, the book has 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's. \n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages are from 401-488. Let's break this down. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let me see: pages 401-410 have a tens digit of 0, 411-420 have 1, 421-430 have 2, 431-440 have 3, 441-450 have 4, 451-460 have 5, 461-470 have 6, 471-480 have 7, and 481-488 have 8. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages (441-450). Similarly, 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 pages (481-488). So, in the tens place, in the last 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, but since we start at 401, it's 441-450. So, that's 10 pages. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. Wait, 480 is page 480, which is in the 401-488 range. So, 480-488 has 9 pages, but wait, 480 is included, right? So, 480 is page 480, and 488 is the last page. So, from 480-488, that's 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, no, 480 is actually 480, so the tens digit is 8, but 480 is part of the 480-489 range. Wait, but 480 is page 480, which is within 401-488. So, the tens digit is 8 in pages 480-488, which is 9 pages, but wait, 480 is included, so that's 9 pages. But wait, 480 is page 480, and 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in this last segment. But earlier, I thought it was 8 times. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, let me recount. From 401-488, the tens digits are as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-490: tens digit 8, but we only go up to 488, so it's 481-488.\n\nSo, in 481-488, the tens digit is 8, and that's 8 pages (481-488). Wait, 481-488 is 8 pages, right? 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, that's 8 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times in this last segment. So, total in the tens place: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (for 4's in 441-450) = 50 4's, and 40 (from first 400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 would have 9 pages, but now I'm seeing that 481-488 is 8 pages. So, maybe 480 is in the 480-488 range, but 480 is page 480, which is part of the 480-488 range. Wait, but 480 is page 480, which is in the 480-488 segment. So, does that mean 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 pages, which would mean the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. But wait, in the tens place, 480 is 480, so the tens digit is 8, right? So, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. But earlier, I thought it was 8. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The pages from 480 to 488 inclusive are 9 pages: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, that's 9 pages, each with a tens digit of 8. Therefore, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in this segment. So, in the first 400 pages, 40 8's in the tens place, plus 9 in the last 88 pages, totaling 49 8's in the tens place. Similarly, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 441-450, so 10 in the last 88 pages, plus 40 from the first 400, totaling 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, in the tens place, 4's: 50, 8's: 49. So, 50 vs. 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 481-488 is 8 pages, but actually, 480 is included, so it's 9 pages. So, 9 8's in the tens place in the last 88 pages. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's: 50, 8's: 49.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, not 8. So, in the hundreds place, 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Pages 400-488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the counts for each digit.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place. Earlier, I thought units place for 4's and 8's were both 49. Let me confirm that.\n\nUnits place: For each 10 pages, 1 4 and 1 8. There are 48 full tens (1-480), so 48 each. Then, in 481-488, units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So that's correct.\n\nTens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Did I count correctly in the tens place? Let me recount.\n\nIn the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would be 40 each. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 441-450 (10 pages) and 8 in 480-488 (9 pages). So, 10 + 40 = 50 for 4's in tens place, and 9 + 40 = 49 for 8's in tens place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 49 8's in tens place. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any other place where 8 could appear? Like, in the hundreds place, 8 would be pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8's only appear in units and tens places.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1-488, how many 4's and 8's in units place?\n\nEach 10 pages have one 4 and one 8. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's, and same for 8's. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, as above, 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, 8's: 98. Difference: 90.\n\nWait, but let me think if I counted correctly in the tens place for the last 88 pages. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, but since we start at 401, it's 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, 10 4's in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). So, 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the last 88 pages, 10 4's and 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place: 40 (from first 400) + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's = floor(488 / 10) + (1 if 488 % 10 >= 4 else 0). Wait, no, that's not the right formula. Wait, actually, for units digit, in each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, for n pages, number of 4's in units place is (n // 10) + (1 if n % 10 >=4 else 0). Similarly for 8's.\n\nSo, for 488 pages:\n\nUnits place 4's: 488 // 10 = 48, plus 1 because 488 % 10 = 8 >=4, so 49.\n\nUnits place 8's: 488 // 10 = 48, plus 1 because 488 %10 >=8, so 49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place: For each hundred, 10 times. So, 488 // 100 = 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in tens place, so 4 *10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 more. So, total 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: 4 full hundreds contribute 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more. So, total 49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98 =90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total groups of 10 pages in 488 pages: 48 full groups, contributing 48 occurrences of each digit.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more '4' (page 484) and one more '8' (page 488).\n   - **Total '4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total '8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - In the first 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - '4' appears in the tens place for pages 441-450 (10 times).\n     - '8' appears in the tens place for pages 480-488 (9 times).\n   - **Total '4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total '8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - The digit '8' never appears in the hundreds place as the book ends at page 488.\n   - **Total '4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total '8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total Occurrences:**\n- **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should count the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract the two counts to find the difference. Let me start by counting the number of 4's in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers. In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is in there, which is another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 instances of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: from 0-99, there's one block (40-49). From 100-199, another block (140-149). From 200-299, another (240-249). From 300-399, another (340-349). From 400-488, the block would be 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but from 400-488, the block is only 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's fine. So, tens place 4's: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's indeed 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. Units and tens seem okay too. So total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, every ten numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of ten, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's another one. So units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Each full block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which contributes 9. So, how many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 is one, 180-189 is two, 280-289 is three, 380-389 is four, and 480-488 is the fifth block. So, the first four blocks are full, each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. The fifth block contributes 9 8's (from 480 to 488). So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4's are 188, and 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the blocks.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49, correct because 48 full tens plus one more in the last 8 numbers.\n- Tens: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens plus one in 488, so 49. Correct.\n- Tens: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40. Plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for 4's was 89, which is correct, but maybe I should check if 488 is included. Since 488 is the last page, yes, it's included in the hundreds place count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this by considering each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nAnother way: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 appears and subtract the number of times 8 appears.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For each position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated by dividing the total number by 10 and considering the remainder.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, the remainder is 8, so in the last partial cycle, numbers 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, units 8's: floor(488 / 10) = 48, each contributing one 8, so 48. Remainder 8, so in 481-488, units digit 8 appears once (488). So units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor tens digit, each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for 488, we can think in terms of hundreds.\n\nNumber of full hundreds: 4 (0-399), and then 488 is in the 400-488 range.\n\nFor digit 4 in tens place:\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds (0-399), that's 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It appears once in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 440-449, which is fully included, so 10 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 times. So total tens 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in tens place:\n\nIn each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8 (in 480-488). So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 times.\n\nSo total tens 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor digit 4 in hundreds place:\n\nNumbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nFor digit 8 in hundreds place:\n\nNumbers from 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but since we only go up to 488, there are 0.\n\nSo, hundreds 4's: 89, hundreds 8's: 0.\n\nNow, adding up:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, I think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of ten (1-480) contribute 48 fours. The last 8 pages (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) each contribute 10 fours. Total: 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours. Total: 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets contribute 48 eights. The last page 488 adds 1 more. Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 40 eights. Pages 480-488 add 9 more. Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No eights. Total: 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can separate the counts based on the number of digits. Let me start by counting the number of 4's and 8's in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For single-digit pages, only page 4 has a 4, and page 8 has an 8. So that's 1 each. For two-digit pages, the units place cycles every 10 numbers. So from 10-19, the units digit is 4 once (14) and 8 once (18). Similarly, from 20-29, it's 24 and 28, and so on up to 90-99. Since there are 9 sets of 10 in the two-digit numbers (10-99), each digit from 0-9 appears once in the units place per set. So for the units place in two-digit numbers, there are 9 4's and 9 8's. Wait, but actually, the two-digit numbers are from 10 to 99, which is 90 numbers, so 9 sets of 10. So each digit 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place. But wait, from 10-99, the units digits go from 0-9 for each ten's place. So yes, 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For single-digit pages, there's no tens digit, so 0. For two-digit pages, the tens digit is from 1-9. So, for each ten's place, the digit 4 appears once in each set of 10, but actually, the entire 40-49 range has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Similarly, the 80-89 range has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So that's 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place for two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, for three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let's consider the hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, 200-299: 2, 300-399:3, and 400-488:4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89), so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place and 0 8's.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. Let's break it down by each hundred. \n\n100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149), and similarly 8 for 10 numbers (180-189). Since there are 10 hundreds? Wait, no, from 100-199, it's just one hundred. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers and 8 for 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, same thing: 10 numbers with tens digit 4 and 10 with 8. Same for 300-399. Now, for 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, but let's see. From 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, for the tens digit 4, we have 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because the book ends at 488. So, in 400-488, tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nSo, let's calculate the total for the tens place in three-digit numbers. \n\nFor 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So that's 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 4's and 30 8's. \n\nFor 400-488: 10 4's and 9 8's. \n\nSo total in tens place for three-digit numbers: 30 +10 =40 4's and 30 +9=39 8's. \n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, in each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the units digit is 4 once every 10 numbers, so 10 times per hundred. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred. \n\nBut for 400-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so let's see. From 400-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units place? \n\nEach ten's group (like 400-409, 410-419, etc.) has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. From 400-480, that's 8 groups (400-409 up to 470-479), each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. So that's 8\u00d71=8 4's and 8\u00d71=8 8's. Then, from 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8, so 480-488 includes 484 (one 4) and 488 (one 8). So that's 1 more 4 and 1 more 8. \n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the units digits are 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total in 400-488: 8 +1=9 4's and 8 +1=9 8's in the units place. \n\nBut wait, for each hundred, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, the units digit 4 appears 10 times each, so 3\u00d710=30 4's. Similarly, 8 appears 3\u00d710=30 times. \n\nIn 400-488, units digit 4 appears 9 times (as calculated) and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nSo total units digit in three-digit numbers: 30 +9=39 4's and 30 +9=39 8's. \n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. \n\nFor 100-199: units digit 4 appears in 104,114,...,194: that's 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times. Same for 200-299 and 300-399. \n\nFor 400-488: units digit 4 appears in 404,414,...,484. From 400-488, how many such numbers? Let's see: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 408,418,...,488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's also 9 times. \n\nSo, total units digit in three-digit numbers: 3\u00d710=30 +9=39 4's and 3\u00d710=30 +9=39 8's. \n\nWait, but that seems a bit conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me confirm: 100-199,200-299,300-399 each have 10 4's and 10 8's in units place, so 30 each. Then 400-488 adds 9 each, so total 39 each. \n\nSo, total 4's in units place across all page numbers: single-digit (1) + two-digit (9) + three-digit (39) = 1+9+39=50. \n\nSimilarly, total 8's in units place: single-digit (1) + two-digit (9) + three-digit (39) =1+9+39=50. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So units place has equal number of 4's and 8's. \n\nNow, moving to the tens place. \n\nIn single-digit pages, tens digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's. \n\nIn two-digit pages, as I thought earlier, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49) and 8 for 10 numbers (80-89). So that's 10 4's and 10 8's. \n\nIn three-digit pages: \n\nFrom 100-399: each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 3\u00d710=30 each. \n\nFrom 400-488: tens digit 4 appears in 440-449: 10 numbers, and tens digit 8 appears in 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). \n\nSo, total tens place in three-digit numbers: 30 +10=40 4's and 30 +9=39 8's. \n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: two-digit (10) + three-digit (40) =50. \n\nTotal 8's in tens place: two-digit (10) + three-digit (39)=49. \n\nNow, moving to the hundreds place. \n\nIn single-digit and two-digit pages, hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's. \n\nIn three-digit pages: \n\nFrom 100-399: hundreds digit is 1,2,3, so no 4's or 8's. \n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times (since 488-400+1=89). \n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place:89. \n\nTotal 8's in hundreds place:0. \n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across all places. \n\nTotal 4's: units (50) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) =50+50+89=189. \n\nTotal 8's: units (50) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=50+49+0=99. \n\nSo, the difference is 189 -99=90. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. \n\nLet me recount:\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Single-digit:1 4,1 8.\n\n- Two-digit:9 4's,9 8's.\n\n- Three-digit:30 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488)=39 each.\n\nTotal units:1+9+39=50 for 4's, same for 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Single-digit:0.\n\n- Two-digit:10 4's,10 8's.\n\n- Three-digit:30 (from 100-399) +10 (from 400-488 for 4's) +30 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488 for 8's).\n\nWait, no, earlier I had:\n\nThree-digit tens place: 30 4's (from 100-399) +10 (from 400-488) =40 4's.\n\nAnd 30 8's (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488) =39 8's.\n\nSo total tens place:40 4's,39 8's.\n\nAdding two-digit tens place:10 4's,10 8's.\n\nTotal 4's in tens place:40+10=50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place:39+10=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488:89 4's.\n\n- 0 8's.\n\nSo total 4's:50 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=189.\n\nTotal 8's:50 (units) +49 (tens) +0=99.\n\nDifference:189-99=90.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- **4's:** 1 (single-digit) + 9 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 50\n- **8's:** 1 (single-digit) + 9 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 50\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- **4's:** 10 (two-digit) + 40 (three-digit) = 50\n- **8's:** 10 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- **4's:** 89 (three-digit)\n- **8's:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 50 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 189\n- **8's:** 50 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 99\n\n**Difference:** 189 - 99 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should separate the counts based on the number of digits in the page numbers. Let's start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. \n\nStarting with the units place. For single-digit page numbers, the units digit is the number itself. So from 1 to 9, the digit 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. For two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So in each set of 10 numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. There are 9 sets of 10 in the two-digit numbers (10-99), so that's 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. But wait, actually from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. But I already counted the single-digit numbers, so maybe I should add those separately. Wait, no, the single-digit numbers are from 1-9, and the two-digit numbers are 10-99. So for the units place, in single-digit, 4 and 8 each appear once. In two-digit, each appears 9 times. So total in units place: 4 appears 1 + 9 = 10 times, and 8 appears 1 + 9 = 10 times. \n\nNow, moving to the tens place. For single-digit numbers, there's no tens digit, so nothing to count there. For two-digit numbers, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. From 10-99, each tens digit from 1 to 9 appears 10 times. So for the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (in 40-49) and 8 appears 10 times (in 80-89). \n\nFor three-digit numbers, from 100-488. The tens place here can be from 0-9 for each hundred. So let's see. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 only goes up to 488, not 499. \n\nFirst, let's consider the tens place in three-digit numbers. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 100 numbers. So for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and the same for 8. But wait, in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 400-488 includes 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. So the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So for the hundreds 100-399, each has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place. But for 400-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (400-409), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So total for tens place in three-digit numbers: 4 appears 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 + 10 = 40 times, and 8 appears 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 + 9 = 39 times. Wait, no, actually, each hundred from 100-399 has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place. So that's 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 each. Then in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (400-409), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So total for tens place: 4 appears 30 + 10 = 40 times, and 8 appears 30 + 9 = 39 times. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit cycles 0-9, so each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So for each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 each. Then in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So for 400-409, the tens digit is 0, but wait, no, 400-409 has tens digit 0, 410-419 has tens digit 1, etc. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 400-409: the tens digit is 0, 410-419: tens digit is 1, 420-429: tens digit is 2, 430-439: tens digit is 3, 440-449: tens digit is 4, 450-459: tens digit is 5, 460-469: tens digit is 6, 470-479: tens digit is 7, 480-488: tens digit is 8. So in the tens place for 400-488, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So yes, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times. So total for tens place: 4 appears 30 + 10 = 40, 8 appears 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, let's move to the hundreds place. For single-digit and two-digit numbers, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so 0 occurrences. For three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, and there are 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. The hundreds digits go from 1 to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So 8's count in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 10 times\n- Tens place: 40 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 10 + 40 + 89 = 139 times.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 10 times\n- Tens place: 39 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 10 + 39 + 0 = 49 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 139 - 49 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Single-digit: 4 appears once (page 4), 8 appears once (page 8).\n- Two-digit: 10-99, each ten has one 4 and one 8 in units place. There are 9 tens (10-99), so 9 each. So total units place: 1 + 9 = 10 for 4, same for 8.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Two-digit: 10-99, each ten has one 4 and one 8 in tens place. So 9 each. Wait, no, from 10-99, the tens digits are 1-9, each appearing 10 times. So for tens place, 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So that's 10 each.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in two-digit numbers, the tens place for 4 and 8 each appear 9 times, but now I'm thinking it's 10 times. Wait, no, from 10-99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So for each tens digit, it's 10 numbers. So for 40-49, that's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, 80-89 is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times. So in two-digit numbers, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So total for tens place:\n\n- 4: 10 (two-digit) + 40 (three-digit) = 50?\nWait, no, I think I confused something earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in two-digit numbers (10-99), the tens place for 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and for 8, it's 10 times (80-89). So that's 10 each.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, from 100-488, the tens place:\n\n- For hundreds 100-399: each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place. So 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 each.\n- For 400-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo total for tens place in three-digit numbers: 4 appears 30 + 10 = 40 times, 8 appears 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSo total for tens place overall: 4 appears 10 (two-digit) + 40 (three-digit) = 50 times, and 8 appears 10 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in two-digit numbers, the tens place for 4 and 8 each appear 10 times, so adding that to the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in three-digit numbers, 4 appears 40 times in the tens place, 8 appears 39 times. So adding the two-digit counts:\n\n4: 10 (two-digit) + 40 (three-digit) = 50\n\n8: 10 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49\n\nHmm, that seems different from my initial calculation. So total 4's: units (10) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 149\n\n8's: units (10) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 59\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with my earlier total. I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recast this.\n\nLet me structure it properly:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 1-9: 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n- 10-99: each ten has one 4 and one 8 in units place. There are 9 tens (10-99), so 9 each.\n- 100-488: each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in units place. There are 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so units digit cycles 0-9 eight times (for 400-479) and then 480-488. So in 400-479, units digits 0-9 each appear 9 times (since 479 - 400 +1 = 80, which is 8 sets of 10). Wait, no, 400-479 is 80 numbers, which is 8 sets of 10, so units digits 0-9 each appear 8 times. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so units digits 0-8 appear once each. So for 400-488, units digit 4 appears 8 times (from 400-479) plus once in 484, so 9 times. Similarly, 8 appears 8 times in 400-479 (408, 418, etc.) plus once in 488, so 9 times.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place across all page numbers.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a formula for digit counting.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n can be calculated as floor(n/10) * 1 + (if the units digit of n is >= d, add 1). Similarly for tens, hundreds, etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to break it down as follows:\n\nTotal number of pages: 488.\n\nLet's count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- For units digit, each digit 0-9 appears equally often, except possibly the last partial set.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48 complete sets, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once.\n\nSo for units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: 48 * 1 + (if the last partial set includes 4, add 1). The last partial set is 481-488, which includes 484, so add 1. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 * 1 + (if the last partial set includes 8, add 1). The last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488, so add 1. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 10 for single and two-digit, but using this method, it's 49. That can't be right because 49 is way higher than the actual count. Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 many times.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So the number of times 4 appears in units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times, plus 1 if the remainder is >=4. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1 =49.\n\nSimilarly for 8: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if remainder >=8, which it is (8>=8), so 48 +1=49.\n\nSo units place: 4's=49, 8's=49.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nSimilarly, each digit 0-9 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So for 4 complete hundreds, each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So in 401-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8, each appearing 9 times (since 488 - 400 = 88, which is 8 full tens and 8 units). Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8 full tens (400-409 is 10 numbers, but starting from 401, it's 401-410, which is 10 numbers, but 401-488 is 88 numbers, so 8 full tens (401-410, 411-420, ..., 481-490), but 488 is the last page, so the last partial ten is 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe a better way is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place from 401-488.\n\nThe tens digit in 401-488 can be 0 (for 401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., 8 (481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears only in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, no, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo for each tens digit from 0 to 7, it appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nTherefore, total tens place counts:\n\n- 4's: 4 complete hundreds \u00d710 =40, plus 10 in 401-488 =50\n- 8's: 4 complete hundreds \u00d710=40, plus 8 in 401-488=48\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times. So total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +8=48.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in tens place were 39, but now it's 48. I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recast:\n\nFrom 1-400, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 1-400, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So 4 hundreds \u00d710=40 each for 4 and 8.\n\nThen from 401-488, as above, 4 appears 10 times in tens place (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nSo total tens place:\n\n- 4's:40 +10=50\n- 8's:40 +8=48\n\nSo units place: 49 each.\n\nTens place: 50 for 4, 48 for 8.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 100-399: hundreds digit is 1,2,3. So 4 and 8 don't appear here.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So 4 appears 89 times (since 488 -400 +1=89). 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo hundreds place:\n\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nNow, adding up all digit places:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:48\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+48=97\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 139 and 8's were 49, but that was a miscalculation. Now, using this method, 4's are 188 and 8's are 97, so the difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The units place from 1-488: 4's=49, 8's=49.\n\nTens place: 4's=50, 8's=48.\n\nHundreds place:4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the difference was 90, but now it's 91. I must have made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, let me confirm with another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if 488 mod10 >=4: 488 mod10=8>=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if 488 mod10 >=8: 8>=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)*10 + (if (488 mod100) >=40, then (488 mod100 -40)/10 +1 else 0).\n\nWait, this is a formula I found online for digit counting.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nFor the tens place, the number of times digit d appears is:\n\n- Complete groups: floor(n / 100) * 10\n- Partial group: if the tens digit of n is >d, add 10; if it's equal to d, add (n mod100 +1).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the formula:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in tens place up to n:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10\nremainder = n % 100\nif remainder >= 10*d +10:\n    count +=10\nelif remainder >=10*d:\n    count += remainder -10*d +1\nelse:\n    pass\n\nSo for d=4:\n\nn=488\n\ncount = 488 // 100 =4, so 4*10=40\n\nremainder=488%100=88\n\n10*d +10=50\n\nSince 88 >=50, count +=10 \u2192 40+10=50\n\nSo 4's in tens place:50\n\nSimilarly for d=8:\n\ncount=4*10=40\n\nremainder=88\n\n10*d +10=90\n\nSince 88 <90, check if remainder >=10*d=80.\n\n88 >=80, so count +=88 -80 +1=9\n\nSo total 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in tens place were 48. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, using this formula, for d=8:\n\ncount=4*10=40\n\nremainder=88\n\nsince 88 >=80, count +=88 -80 +1=9 \u2192 total 49.\n\nBut earlier, when I counted manually, I thought 8's in tens place were 48. So which is correct?\n\nWait, let's see: from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-400: each hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 hundreds \u00d710=40.\n\nFrom 401-488: the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So 9 times.\n\nSo total 40 +9=49.\n\nSo the formula is correct, and my earlier manual count was wrong. So 8's in tens place:49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, but that's incorrect. It's 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488.\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers (including both 480 and 488). So 9 times.\n\nSo total 8's in tens place:40 +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in tens place: from 1-400, 40 times, and from 401-488, 10 times (440-449), so total 50.\n\nSo now, units place:49 each.\n\nTens place:4's=50, 8's=49.\n\nHundreds place:4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in tens place were 49, so total 8's would be 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSo difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier with the formula, I got 8's in tens place as 49, so total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought 8's in tens place were 48, I got 97, but that was wrong.\n\nSo correct counts:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more.\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's:49, 8's:49.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:50, 8's:49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Let me start by analyzing each position one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's go through each position.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in every block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, it cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. How many hundreds do we have? From 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0-8 in the 400s. So, the tens digit 4 appears once in 440-449, which is 10 times. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 401-488: the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, for the tens digit 4, it occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So that's another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488: the tens digit goes up to 8, so 440-449 is within that range. So yes, that's 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the 400s, which is from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, yes, each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so hundreds digit is 4 for each of these, so 89 times. So, units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds:89. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I think the process is similar.\n\nStarting with the units place. Again, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are in 488? 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, in each hundred, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each hundred, that's 10 times. How many hundreds do we have? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, in each of the 4 hundreds, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, 480 has tens digit 8, 481 has 8, up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488: the tens digit goes from 0-8. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is included, and 488 is the end. So, that's 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the 800s, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place never has an 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last 8 numbers (481-488) where 484 has a 4 in units, so 1 more, total 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so total 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 488, which is 1 more, total 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's in 401-488. The tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is included, so 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. That's correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSo, yes, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any edge cases. For example, in the units place for 4's, does 484 count as one? Yes, because it's in the units place. Similarly, for 8's, 488 is counted once in the units place.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: for each digit position, count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet me try another approach to confirm.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, which it is, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=8, which it is, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 100) = 4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus in the last partial hundred, how many times does 4 appear in tens place? From 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So total 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: floor(488 / 100)=4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: if the hundreds digit is 4, which is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: hundreds digit 8 would be from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and the number of 8's separately and then subtract the two totals to find the difference. Let's start with the 4's. I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 pages. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48. But wait, the last block is from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. In this block, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Each complete block of 10 contributes one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers, and in the units place, 484 has a 4, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me confirm that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place again. Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, that's 48 blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, from 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes one block of 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all, so that's 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Each has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 8's. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For the tens place, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 (from the first four hundreds) plus 9 is 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, when I counted the 4's in the hundreds place, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the units place again. For the 8's, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 48 full blocks (1-480) contribute 48 8's, and then from 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the units place, it's the same: 48 full blocks (1-480) contribute 48 4's, and then from 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, from 1-400, we have four blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 4's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, from 1-400, we have four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 8's. That's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I should consider the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages numbered 800 or above, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just think again if there's any overlap or if I missed any numbers. For example, in the units place, when counting 4's, I considered 484 as one occurrence, and in the tens place, 440-449 as 10 occurrences. Similarly, for 8's, 488 in the units place and 480-488 in the tens place. I think that's all covered.\n\nAnother way to check is to write a small program or use a different counting method, but since I'm doing it manually, I think this is accurate.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every block of 10 numbers contributes one 4.\n   - From 1 to 480: 48 blocks \u2192 48 fours.\n   - From 481 to 488: 484 has a 4 \u2192 1 four.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every block of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours (e.g., 40-49).\n   - From 1 to 400: 4 blocks \u2192 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours.\n   - From 400 to 488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 fours.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every block of 10 numbers contributes one 8.\n   - From 1 to 480: 48 blocks \u2192 48 eights.\n   - From 481 to 488: 488 has an 8 \u2192 1 eight.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights (e.g., 80-89).\n   - From 1 to 400: 4 blocks \u2192 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights.\n   - From 400 to 488: 480-488 \u2192 9 eights.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 eights.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should count the occurrences of 4 and 8 separately and then find the difference. Let me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, for 4's in the units place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete group of 10, 4 appears once in the units place. So that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, each group of 10 has one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. The extra 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits up to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nHmm, so so far, both 4's and 8's in units place are equal, 49 each. So the difference so far is zero. Now, let's move to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. So, for each 100 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 times 10 is 40. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place 10 times in each hundred (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 times 10 is 40.\n\nNow, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-409: tens digit is 0.\n410-419: tens digit is 1.\n420-429: tens digit is 2.\n430-439: tens digit is 3.\n440-449: tens digit is 4. So that's 10 times.\n450-459: tens digit is 5.\n460-469: tens digit is 6.\n470-479: tens digit is 7.\n480-488: tens digit is 8. So from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times? Wait, no, each tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers (480-488). So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, in the extra 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's: 49. So difference here is +1 for 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. \n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit represents 100 numbers. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, it's 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). So, 89 times.\n\nThe digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate: 49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages. For units digit 4: every 10 pages, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 times, plus in the last partial set (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units place, so 49 total. Similarly, 8's in units: same, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), for 4's in tens place, 440-449: 10 times. For 8's, 480-488: 9 times. So 4's: 40+10=50; 8's: 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 4's from 400-488: 89 times. 8's: none.\n\nAdding up: 4's: 49+50+89=188; 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occur once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, giving 48 occurrences. Plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, occur once every 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred has 10 occurrences. 4 hundreds contribute 40. In 401-488, 440-449 adds 10, totaling 50.\n   - **8's:** Each hundred has 10 occurrences, contributing 40. In 401-488, 480-488 adds 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Pages 400-488 have 89 occurrences.\n   - **8's:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nSumming up:\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
