    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each of these places across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each position as we count upwards. So, in the units place, for every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit appears once. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once.\n\nNow, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each complete group of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. Therefore, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, and the same for 8's, so 48 as well.\n\nBut wait, there are 8 extra numbers after 480: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Let me check the units digits in these. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these 8 numbers, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, for the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, no difference here.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo, for each of the 4 complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 10, so 4*10=40. Similarly, for 8's, it's 4*10=40.\n\nNow, let's check the incomplete hundred from 401-488. The tens digits here range from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Looking at 440-449, which is 10 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the tens digits go up to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 times. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this last partial hundred.\n\nTherefore, for the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. The number of 8's is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. That's a difference of 1 in favor of 4's.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, it's 10 numbers except for the last one if it's cut short. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8, it's 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers. So, yes, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred. So, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50. 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are more by 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears, since the book has 488 pages. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 page numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. That's a difference of 89 in favor of 4's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nNow, for the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8. Then, in the tens place, 4's were 50 and 8's were 49. In the hundreds place, 4's were 89 and 8's were 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me think again about the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, how many times does it appear? For example, tens digit 0 appears in 401-410, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 1 appears in 411-420, etc., up to 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 10\n- 1: 10\n- 2: 10\n- 3: 10\n- 4: 10 (440-449)\n- 5: 10\n- 6: 10\n- 7: 10\n- 8: 9\n\nSo, total numbers in 401-488: 88 numbers, which matches 488 - 400 = 88.\n\nSo, for the tens digit 4, it's 10 times, and 8 is 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For each digit place, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated based on higher digits and lower digits. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 400-488 range. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's total is 188, 8's is 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and see if I get the same result.\n\nCalculating the number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 488 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have one 4 in the units place (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: For each 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, 488 / 100 = 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449). So, total in tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: As before, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 +89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: Same as 4's, 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: For each 100, 10 times for 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, 8 in the tens place appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 40 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe using a formula for digit frequency.\n\nIn general, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as follows:\n\nnumber_of_d_units = (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(N % 10 - d + 1, 0), 1)\n\nWait, maybe that's too formulaic, but perhaps I can use it to verify.\n\nWait, for N=488, for digit 4 in units place:\n\nnumber_of_4_units = (488 // 10) * 1 + min(max(488 % 10 - 4 + 1, 0), 1)\n= 48 * 1 + min(max(8 -4 +1,0),1)\n= 48 + min(max(5,0),1)\n= 48 +1=49. That matches.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in units place:\n\nnumber_of_8_units = (488 //10)*1 + min(max(488%10 -8 +1,0),1)\n=48 + min(max(8-8+1,0),1)\n=48 + min(max(1,0),1)\n=48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place, the formula is a bit more involved. The number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N is:\n\nhigher = N // 100\ncurrent = (N // 10) % 10\nlower = N % 10\n\nif d < current:\n    count = (higher + 1) * 10\nelif d == current:\n    count = higher * 10 + lower + 1\nelse:\n    count = higher * 10\n\nWait, let's test this for d=4 in the tens place, N=488.\n\nhigher = 488 //100 =4\ncurrent = (488//10)%10=8%10=8\nlower =488%10=8\n\nSince d=4 < current=8:\n\ncount = (higher +1)*10 = (4+1)*10=50.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation of 50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in the tens place:\n\nhigher=4\ncurrent=8\nlower=8\n\nSince d=8 == current=8:\n\ncount= higher *10 + lower +1=4*10 +8+1=40+9=49.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nFor the hundreds place, the formula is similar.\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in hundreds place from 1 to N:\n\nif d < (N // 100):\n    count = 100\nelif d == (N // 100):\n    count = N % 100 + 1\nelse:\n    count =0\n\nWait, for d=4 in hundreds place, N=488:\n\nhigher = N //100 =4\nif d=4 == higher=4:\n    count= N%100 +1=88 +1=89.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nFor d=8 in hundreds place:\n\nhigher=4 <8, so count=0.\n\nSo, using these formulas, we get the same results as before, which confirms that our counts for 4's and 8's are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. The same goes for 8's.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n1. Units place: In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's on page 4; from 11-20, it's on page 14, and so on. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each complete block, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit 4 appears on page 484. So, that's 1 more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, the tens digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, this happens in every hundred, like 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, which means there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the next hundred (401-488). Each complete hundred has 10 occurrences of the tens digit 4. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let's see, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's another 10 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's correct. So, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit 4 appears in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each has a hundreds digit of 4, so yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit 8 appears on page 488. So, that's 1 more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: The tens digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.), and then the last partial hundred is 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. That's from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so each of those 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive) contributes an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9 times.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit 8 would appear in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because I thought maybe the hundreds place would contribute, but since the book doesn't go beyond 488, it's correct. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full decades + 1 in 481-488 = 49\n- Tens: 4 full centuries (each contributing 10) = 40, plus 10 in 440-449 = 50\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488)\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full decades + 1 in 488 = 49\n- Tens: 4 full centuries (each contributing 10) = 40, plus 9 in 480-488 = 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct. So, 98 total 8's.\n\nAnd for 4's, the hundreds place is 89, which is correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of times 4 appears in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for 8. Maybe I can handle each place separately.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. The same goes for 8. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each complete block, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, that's 48 times for each digit. Now, for the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, the units place contributes equally to both digits, 49 each.\n\nMoving on to the tens place: Here, the digit 4 or 8 will appear in the tens place for a block of 100 numbers. For example, in the 40-49 range, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in the 80-89 range, the tens digit is 8 for all 10 numbers. So, each complete hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place and 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit. Now, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Wait, no, actually, 400 is the end of the fourth hundred. So, from 401 to 488, that's 88 numbers. Let me correct that: the remaining pages after the fourth hundred (301-400) are 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, in the tens place for these 88 numbers, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. But wait, 401-488 is part of the 400-499 range. So, the tens digit in this range is 0-9 for each hundred, but we're only going up to 488. So, let's think about the tens place in 401-488.\n\nIn 401-409, the tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8 in the tens place. In 410-419, the tens digit is 1, again no 4 or 8. Similarly, 420-429: tens digit 2, no. 430-439: tens digit 3, no. 440-449: tens digit 4, so that's 10 occurrences of 4. Then 450-459: tens digit 5, no. 460-469: tens digit 6, no. 470-479: tens digit 7, no. 480-488: tens digit 8, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for each of these 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit contributes 10 times 4 and 9 times 8.\n\nSo, adding that to the earlier 40 each from the complete hundreds, the total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the complete hundreds (1-400), each hundred contributes 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 times) and 8 for 480-488 (9 times). So, yes, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. Therefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let me summarize:\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: For each 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1 =49 for 4, same for 8. That's correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place. 4 hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 times) and 8 for 480-488 (9 times). So, 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, hence 89 times 4. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up: 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188. 8's:49 +49 +0=98. Difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those. So, that's 89 times 4. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again in the 401-488 range. So, 401-488 is 88 numbers. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the tens place for each hundred. So, for 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit 1; ... up to 480-488, tens digit 8.\n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times 4. The tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 9 times 8. So, that part is correct.\n\nWait, but in 401-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so the numbers are 401 to 488. So, the tens digit in 401-488: for each ten, like 401-410, 411-420, etc., up to 480-488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. The first page is 1, so units digits go from 0-9 in each block of 10, except maybe the first block which starts at 1. Wait, actually, in the first block (1-9), the units digits are 1-9, so 0 doesn't appear. But when counting the number of 4's and 8's in the units place, for each block of 10, starting from 1-10, 11-20, etc., each block of 10 has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place, except the first block (1-9) which has no 0, but does have 4 and 8 if they exist. Wait, in 1-9, 4 appears once (page 4) and 8 appears once (page 8). So, actually, every block of 10 pages, whether starting at 1 or 11, etc., will have exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, in 488 pages, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in each complete block, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so 48 times each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units digits: 48 +1=49 for 4, and same for 8. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 1-99, there's no hundreds digit, so 4 and 8 can't appear in the hundreds place. From 100-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so 4 and 8 don't appear there either. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times (400-488 inclusive). 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, adding up the counts:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49 +50=99; 99+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for the 401-488 range. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times 4. Then, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times 8. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about 401-488 again. 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 in the tens place. Correct.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 9th number in that range. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nHmm, seems correct. So, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to calculate this. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)*1 + (if the last partial block has a 4 in units place, add 1). Similarly for 8's.\n\nSo, floor(488/10)=48, so 48 times each, plus check the last 8 numbers (481-488). The units digits are 1-8, so 4 is present once (484), and 8 is present once (488). So, 48+1=49 for both.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)*10 + (if the last partial hundred has tens digit 4, add the count). Similarly for 8's.\n\nfloor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40 for each. Then, check the last 88 numbers (401-488). In the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, in the 400-499 range, the tens digit is 0-9 for each hundred. But we're only going up to 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For tens digit 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total for tens place: 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+9=49 for 8.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)*100 + (if the last partial thousand has hundreds digit 4, add the count). But since 488 is less than 1000, floor(488/1000)=0, so 0*100=0. Then, check if the hundreds digit is 4 in the remaining numbers. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89 times 4. For 8's, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units(49) + tens(50) + hundreds(89) = 188\n8's: units(49) + tens(49) + hundreds(0) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each set of ten numbers. For example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1-0, so 1 appears once, 2 once, etc., up to 0 once. So, for each complete set of ten numbers, each digit appears once in the units place. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each complete set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once. So, for 48 complete sets, that's 48 times 4's and 48 times 8's in the units place.\n\nBut wait, in the last partial set (481-488), how many 4's and 8's are there in the units place? Let's list them: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding that, the units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. Wait, but that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake here. Wait, no, actually, for each complete set of ten, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so in each set, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, 48 sets give 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. So, units place: fours = 49, eights = 49.\n\nWait, but that seems like the same number, so maybe the difference comes from other places. Let me check the tens place now.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each set of 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), etc., up to 9 (90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages (401-488). So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours and 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the last partial hundred, 401-488? Let's see how the tens digit behaves here. The numbers go from 401 to 488, so the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), up to 8 (481-488). So, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except for the last one, which is 8 and appears 8 times (since 481-488 is 8 numbers). Wait, no, actually, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times (since 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488). Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 10 numbers.\n\n411-420: tens digit is 1, 10 numbers.\n\n421-430: tens digit is 2, 10 numbers.\n\n431-440: tens digit is 3, 10 numbers.\n\n441-450: tens digit is 4, 10 numbers.\n\n451-460: tens digit is 5, 10 numbers.\n\n461-470: tens digit is 6, 10 numbers.\n\n471-480: tens digit is 7, 10 numbers.\n\n481-488: tens digit is 8, 8 numbers (since 481-488 is 8 numbers).\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times (in 441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (in 481-488). So, the tens place in the last partial hundred contributes 10 fours and 8 eights.\n\nSo, adding up the tens place:\n\nFrom the full hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights.\n\nFrom the partial hundred: 10 fours and 8 eights.\n\nTotal in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, and 40 + 8 = 48 eights.\n\nSo, tens place contributes 50 fours and 48 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in 300-399 and 400-488. Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 300-399: that's 100 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 3, not 4. Wait, no, 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so 4 doesn't appear here. Wait, no, 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be where 8 appears in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the digits.\n\nFor fours:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 50\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nWait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89: 99 + 89. 90 + 80 is 170, 9 + 9 is 18, so total 188.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 48\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, so fours: 188, eights: 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check my calculations again, because maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, plus the last 8 numbers (481-488) contributing one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 + 1 = 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights. So, 4*10=40 fours, 4*10=40 eights. Then, the last partial hundred (401-488) has tens digits from 0 to 8, with 4 appearing 10 times (441-450) and 8 appearing 8 times (481-488). So, adding 10 fours and 8 eights. So, total tens: 40+10=50 fours, 40+8=48 eights. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. No eights in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, fours total: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nEights total: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more fours than eights.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the tens place in the last partial hundred. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, for each tens digit, how many times does 4 appear? In 441-450, that's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, yes, 10 fours and 8 eights in the tens place of the last partial hundred. So, 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 8 = 48 eights. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check: total number of digits. Let's see, from 1-9: 9 numbers, 1 digit each: 9 digits.\n\n10-99: 90 numbers, 2 digits each: 180 digits.\n\n100-488: 389 numbers, 3 digits each: 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, total number of fours: 188.\n\nTotal number of eights: 97.\n\nSo, 188 + 97 = 285. That leaves 1356 - 285 = 1071 digits for other numbers. That seems plausible, but maybe not necessary for the problem.\n\nWait, another way: perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check that again. From 1-99, hundreds digit is 0, so no fours or eights there. From 100-399, hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so no fours or eights. From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of fours printed is 188, and the number of eights is 97, so the difference is 91.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I was calculating the units place, I considered 488 as the last page, so in the units place, from 1-488, how many complete tens are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete tens, and 8 extra numbers. So, each complete ten has one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units fours: 48 + 1 = 49, units eights: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so the last number is 488, which is correct. So, yes, units place is correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all parts, so I'm confident the answer is 91.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once in every set of ten consecutive numbers.\n   - Total complete sets of ten in 488 pages: 48 sets (1-480).\n   - Each set contributes one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - Partial set (481-488): '4' appears once (484), '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears ten times in every set of hundred consecutive numbers.\n   - Total complete hundreds in 488 pages: 4 sets (1-400).\n   - Each hundred contributes ten '4's and ten '8's in the tens place.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488):\n     - '4' appears ten times (441-450).\n     - '8' appears eight times (481-488).\n   - Total '4's in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's in tens place: 4*10 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place within 488 pages.\n   - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total '8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}."

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by separating the problem into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers. \n\nStarting with single-digit pages: 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for single-digit pages, the count of 4's is 1 and the count of 8's is also 1.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers:\n- The tens digit cycles from 1 to 9. So, for each ten's digit, there are 10 numbers (e.g., 10-19, 20-29, etc.).\n- For the digit 4 in the tens place, the numbers are 40-49. That's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n- Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, the numbers are 80-89. That's another 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers:\n- The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.).\n- For each ten's group, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Since there are 9 ten's groups (10-99), the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place.\n- Similarly, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the units place as well.\n\nWait, but hold on, from 10-99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 ten's groups (10-19, 20-29,...,90-99). So, for each digit (4 and 8), in the units place, they each appear 9 times. So, adding up, for two-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\nWait, but that would mean 19 each, so no difference in two-digit numbers. But let me double-check. For example, in the tens place, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Similarly, 80-89 is 10 8's. In the units place, for each ten's group, 4 and 8 each appear once, so 9 times each. So yes, 10+9=19 for each digit in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. I'll need to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place separately.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, for the hundreds place:\n- When the hundreds digit is 1: 100-199. In this range, the hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's here.\n- When the hundreds digit is 2: 200-299. Similarly, no 4's or 8's in the hundreds place.\n- When the hundreds digit is 3: 300-399. Again, no 4's or 8's in the hundreds place.\n- When the hundreds digit is 4: 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place, 8's never appear because the highest hundreds digit is 4, so 8's in the hundreds place would be from 800 onwards, which isn't part of this book. So, 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're considering 100-488, the tens digit will vary accordingly.\n\nI think it's better to break this down by each hundreds group and then see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFirst, for hundreds digit 1 (100-199):\n- The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, and for each tens digit, there are 10 numbers (e.g., 100-109, 110-119, etc.).\n- For the tens digit 4: 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n- Similarly, for the tens digit 8: 180-189. That's another 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nNext, hundreds digit 2 (200-299):\n- Same logic applies. For tens digit 4: 240-249, 10 occurrences.\n- For tens digit 8: 280-289, 10 occurrences.\n\nHundreds digit 3 (300-399):\n- Tens digit 4: 340-349, 10 occurrences.\n- Tens digit 8: 380-389, 10 occurrences.\n\nHundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n- Here, the tens digit can go from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, let's see:\n  - For tens digit 4: 440-449. That's 10 numbers.\n  - For tens digit 8: 480-488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place here.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but when the tens digit is 8, the units digits go from 0 to 8, making 9 numbers (480-488). So, yes, 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, adding up the tens place occurrences for each hundreds group:\n- For 4's in tens place: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 10 (hundreds 4) = 40 occurrences.\n- For 8's in tens place: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, that's 40 for 4's and 39 for 8's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, I'll break this down by hundreds group.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1 (100-199):\n- The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens group.\n- For each tens group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well.\n- Since there are 10 tens groups (0-9), each digit (4 and 8) appears 10 times in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299):\n- Same as above: 10 occurrences each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nHundreds digit 3 (300-399):\n- Again, 10 each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nHundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n- Here, the tens digit can go from 0 to 8, but the units digit goes from 0 to 9 except when the tens digit is 8, where it only goes up to 8 (since the book ends at 488). Wait, no, actually, when the hundreds digit is 4 and the tens digit is 8, the units digits go from 0 to 8 (480-488). So, for the units place in hundreds digit 4:\n  - For each tens group (0-9, except when tens is 8, where units only go up to 8), the digit 4 appears once in the units place per tens group, except maybe the last one.\n  - Let me think: For each tens group from 0 to 7, the units digits go from 0 to 9, so 4 appears once in each. For tens group 8, units go from 0 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total for 4 in units place for hundreds digit 4 is 9 (tens groups 0-8) each contributing 1 occurrence. Wait, no, wait: from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, the units digits go from 0 to 9 except when tens digit is 8, where units go up to 8.\n\nWait, so for the units place in hundreds digit 4:\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 units digits (0-9), so 4 appears once in each, so 8 times (tens 0-7) \u00d7 1 = 8.\n- For tens digit 8: Units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So total for 4 in units place is 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place in hundreds digit 4:\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 units digits, so 8 appears once in each, so 8 times \u00d7 1 = 8.\n- For tens digit 8: Units digits 0-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total for 8 in units place is 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nWait, but wait, when tens digit is 8, units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, yes, 9 occurrences for both 4 and 8 in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, but let me check: for hundreds digit 4, the units digits for 4 would be at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. Similarly, 8's would be at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's also 9 times. So, yes, 9 each.\n\nSo, adding up the units place occurrences across all hundreds groups:\n- For 4's: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39.\n- For 8's: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39.\n\nWait, but hold on, that seems off because for hundreds digit 4, units place for 4's is 9 and for 8's is 9, but for hundreds digits 1-3, it's 10 each. So, 10+10+10+9=39 for both 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the tens place for hundreds digit 4, 8's only had 9 occurrences because the last page is 488, which cuts off at 488. So, in the units place, it's the same for 8's in hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me make sure I'm adding correctly.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers:\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 10 (hundreds 4) = 40\n  - 8's: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39\n  - 8's: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 79\n- 8's: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for hundreds digit 4. Earlier, I thought that for 4's in tens place, it's 10 numbers (440-449), which is correct. For 8's, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, yes, tens place for 4's is 10 and for 8's is 9 in hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 79\n- 8's: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4's: 79\n- 8's: 78\n\nTotal 4's = 1 + 19 + 79 = 99\nTotal 8's = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, so total 4's are 99 and 8's are 98, so 99 - 98 = 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding up the three-digit counts. Let me recheck:\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n- Tens place: 4's = 40, 8's = 39\n- Units place: 4's = 39, 8's = 39\n\nWait, hold on, earlier I thought that in three-digit numbers, I should also include the hundreds place. So, perhaps I made a mistake by only considering tens and units place for three-digit numbers. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, earlier, I considered hundreds place separately and found that 4's appear 89 times in the hundreds place. Then, for tens and units, I had:\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 40\n- 8's: 39\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 39\n- 8's: 39\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers would be 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\nSimilarly, total 8's in three-digit numbers would be 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nWait, that's different from what I had earlier. So, I think I missed adding the hundreds place earlier, which is a big mistake.\n\nSo, let's correct that.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nSo, total 4's = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, that seems like a big difference. Let me make sure I didn't overcount.\n\nWait, let's go through each part again carefully.\n\nSingle-digit pages (1-9):\n- 4 appears once (page 4)\n- 8 appears once (page 8)\n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99):\n- Tens place:\n  - 4 appears in 40-49: 10 times\n  - 8 appears in 80-89: 10 times\n- Units place:\n  - For each ten's group (10-19, 20-29,...,90-99), 4 appears once in units place. There are 9 ten's groups (10-99), so 9 times.\n  - Similarly, 8 appears 9 times in units place.\n- So, total 4's in two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19\n- Total 8's in two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19\n\nThree-digit pages (100-488):\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4 appears in 400-488: 89 times\n  - 8 never appears in hundreds place\n- Tens place:\n  - For hundreds digit 1: 140-149 (10 times)\n  - For hundreds digit 2: 240-249 (10 times)\n  - For hundreds digit 3: 340-349 (10 times)\n  - For hundreds digit 4: 440-449 (10 times)\n  - Total 4's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\n  - For hundreds digit 1: 180-189 (10 times)\n  - For hundreds digit 2: 280-289 (10 times)\n  - For hundreds digit 3: 380-389 (10 times)\n  - For hundreds digit 4: 480-488 (9 times, since 480-488 is 9 numbers)\n  - Total 8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n- Units place:\n  - For hundreds digit 1: in each ten's group (100-199), 4 and 8 each appear once in units place across 10 numbers. So, 10 times each.\n  - Similarly for hundreds digits 2 and 3: 10 each.\n  - For hundreds digit 4: in each ten's group from 400-488, except the last one (480-488), units digits go up to 9, except for 480-488 where units go up to 8.\n    - For 400-479: units digits go from 0-9 for each ten's group, so 4 appears once per ten's group. There are 8 ten's groups (400-409, 410-419,...,470-479), so 8 times.\n    - For 480-488: units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once (at 484)\n    - So, total 4's in units place for hundreds digit 4: 8 + 1 = 9\n    - Similarly, 8's in units place for hundreds digit 4: 8 (from 400-479) + 1 (at 488) = 9\n  - So, total 4's in units place: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39\n  - Total 8's in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nSo, three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nAdding up all page numbers:\n- Total 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n- Total 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 1, but that was before I realized I had missed the hundreds place in three-digit numbers. So, the correct difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. Maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4:1, 8:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4:19, 8:19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8's: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I think this method will help me count the occurrences systematically.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of 4's in each position.\n\n1. Units place: For the units digit, every 10 consecutive numbers will have exactly one 4. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there between 1 and 488?\n\nWell, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Since every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place, the number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a digit, I should take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. Hmm, but wait, 484 is 484, so that's 48 times. But wait, let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many terms are there? The first term is 4, and the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so I made a mistake earlier. It should be 49 times, not 48. Because 484 is the 49th term. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens digit, every 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. But since the book only goes up to 488, I need to check if 440-449 is included and whether 480-488 affects this count.\n\nWait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 occurrences. Similarly, 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is another 10, and 340-349 is another 10. Then, 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, does 480-488 affect this? Because 480-488 has 8's in the tens place, but 4's in the tens place would be up to 449. So, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, for the hundreds digit, the 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, how many numbers is that? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nWait, let me confirm that again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms are there?\n\nThe first term is 8, the last term is 488. Common difference is 10. So, number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: For the tens digit, every 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, how does this affect the count?\n\nWait, let me think. Each full hundred block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full hundreds (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and the last partial hundred contributing 9.\n\nSo, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the tens place calculation again. For each hundred block, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. There are four such blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. Each of these has 80-89, 180-189, etc., contributing 10 each. So, 4*10=40. Then, the last block is 400-488, which includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40+9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the 4's count again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnd for 8's: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, I might have missed something. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there.\n\nAnd for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, the counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188-98=90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for 4's, I considered up to 440-449, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, I considered up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place in that last partial hundred. So, 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each, and 9 in the last, totaling 49. That seems right.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n1. **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one '4'. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers have 10 '4's in the tens place.

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the answer.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for 8's. \n\nStarting with the units place for 4's: In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each block, 4 appears once, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is within 481-488. So, that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, for the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49 is one block, then 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait, the last block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. Starting with units place: Similar to 4, in every block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 occurrence, so 48 times. Plus, in the last partial block (481-488), does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8, so that's one more. So, total 48 +1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nTens place for 8: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences in the tens place. Let's count the blocks:\n\n80-89: 10 numbers\n180-189: 10\n280-289: 10\n380-389: 10\n480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 times.\n\nWait, so each block except the last one has 10, but the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but each has 8 in the tens place, so 9 times. So, total 40 +9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, so the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 is the only one with a 4 in units place, so 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 5x10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 488/10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last block (481-488), 488 is the only one with 8 in units place, so 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4x10=40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again about the tens place for 8's. The last block is 480-488. How many numbers are there? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). Each of these has 8 in the tens place, so 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** In every block of 10, 4 appears once. There are 48 full blocks (488 / 10 = 48.8), contributing 48 occurrences. The last partial block (481-488) adds 1 more (484). Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. 48 full blocks contribute 48, with the last block adding 1 (488). Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9. Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, I can calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and taking the integer part. But since 488 isn't a multiple of 10, I'll have to adjust for the remaining pages.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to count how many full groups of 10 there are and then check the remaining pages. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups and 8 remaining pages. Each full group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), I need to check if any of these have a 4 in the units place. Looking at 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place. That's one more. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, the remaining pages are 481-488, which is 8 pages. In these, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, yes, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49 in each hundred. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, in the first hundred (1-100), it's pages 40-49: 10 times. In the second hundred (101-200), it's 140-149: another 10 times. Similarly, in the third hundred (201-300), it's 240-249: 10 times. In the fourth hundred (301-400), it's 340-349: 10 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488? Wait, no, 440 is within 401-488, but 449 is also within that range. So, that's another 10 pages. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is greater than 401 and 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 times. So, how many hundreds are we considering? Let me think again.\n\nWait, 488 is the total number of pages. So, the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, let me check each step again.\n\nWait, units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Hmm, that seems high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, similar to the 4's, but let's check.\n\nTotal pages: 488. Divided by 10 is 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, same as 4's in units place. Interesting.\n\nNow, tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. Specifically, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages: 80-89 in each hundred. So, how many hundreds do we have? 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488.\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times each, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the 800s, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check: units place 49, tens place 49, so 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, counting 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), 484 has a 4, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 is another 10, so +10, total 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages, 488 has an 8, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: Each of the first four hundreds contributes 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. In the last partial hundred (401-488), 480-488 is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since we don't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the difference seems quite large. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and see if the counts make sense.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor 4's: As before, 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 has a 4, so +1, total 49.\n\nFor 8's: 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 488 has an 8, so +1, total 49.\n\nSo, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 is another 10, so +10, total 50.\n\nFor 8's: Each of the first four hundreds contributes 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. In 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49.\n\nSo, tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nFor 8's: 0, since we don't reach 800.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, so it seems consistent. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each place one by one, calculating how many times 4 and 8 appear in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (e.g., 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then an extra 8 pages. In each of these 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial block (pages 481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, page 484. So, that's one more. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, each block of 10 has one 8, so 48 times. In the last partial block, the units digits go up to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Wait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the units place contributes equally to both digits.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. In the tens digit, each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, that's 10 times in each 100-number block. Similarly, for 8, it's also 10 times per block.\n\nNow, how many complete 100-number blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of these 4 blocks, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times per block, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, looking at the last partial block (401-488). The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, how many times does it appear? Pages 440-449 would have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's valid. So, that's another 10 times for 4 in the tens place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, the tens digit in 488 is 8, which we'll handle in the 8's count.\n\nWait, but I'm only considering the tens place here. So, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's only in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens place 4's are 40 (from the four blocks) + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, in each complete block, it's 10 times, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. In the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in pages 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). Wait, 480 is included, right? So, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 in all of these, so that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. In the last partial block, 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, when the tens digit is 8, the pages are 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, for the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, that's a difference of +1 for 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the hundreds place, how many times does it appear? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 pages. So, that's 89 occurrences.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place, looking at the same range, 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, not 8. So, in the hundreds place, 8 never appears because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times. That's a big difference.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each. Then, in the last partial block (pages 481-488), units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 +1 =49 for 4, and 48 +1=49 for 8. That's correct.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4's: Each 100-number block has 10 occurrences in the tens place. 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contribute 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more. So, total 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: Each 100-number block has 10 occurrences. 4 blocks give 40. In 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in pages 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). So, 9 more, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times. Correct.\n- 8's: None, as the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit never reaches 8. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\n\nDifference: 188 -98 =90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 -400 +1 =89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for the tens place in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages because 480 is included. So, 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nI think I did everything right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 pages have 48 full blocks of 10, contributing 48 each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n   - 4 blocks (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - The last 88 pages (401-488) add 10 more 4's (440-449) and 9 more 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences of 4.\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the answer.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of ten and then 8 extra numbers. In each of these 48 groups, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in every group of 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, and 340-349. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, up to 488, so the last range is only up to 488, not 499. So, in each of the first four ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), there are 10 4's in the tens place. That's 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the range 400-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 40-49, that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Similarly, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 340-349, which is another 10. So, that's 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, the 4's in the tens place would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10. So, yes, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many times does 4 appear here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is the sum of 4's in units, tens, and hundreds places. So, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, for every group of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1 occurrence of 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nFirst, in 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nIn 100-199: 180-189 is another 10.\n\nIn 200-299: 280-289 is another 10.\n\nIn 300-399: 380-389 is another 10.\n\nIn 400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.\n\nWait, that's 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place count. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought the units place for 8's was 49, and the tens place was 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. For the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 8's? Every 10 numbers, there's one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so that's one more 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, as calculated, 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in units. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 times, plus one more in the last partial group (484). So, 49.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Up to 400-488. So, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10. So, 5\u00d710=50. Wait, earlier I thought it was 4 ranges, but actually, 40-49 is in 0-99, 140-149 in 100-199, 240-249 in 200-299, 340-349 in 300-399, and 440-449 in 400-488. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10. So, 50. So, that's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49, as before.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10\u00d74 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, difference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just check if I didn't double-count or miss any ranges.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 10 each, 5 ranges, 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four are 10 each, the last is 9, so total 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits: 49 each, correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nSo, yes, 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of 4's. I'll consider each position in the page numbers separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4); in 11-20, it appears once (page 14); and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every block of 100 numbers, the digit in the tens place cycles from 0 to 9 for each set of 10 numbers. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full hundreds in 488 pages: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, the remaining pages are 401-488. In this range, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 pages. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, in 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; up to 481-490, but since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages. So, that's 10 fours. So, total fours in the tens place are 40 (from the four full hundreds) plus 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. The first four hundreds (1-400) each have 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 fours. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nSo, total fours in all positions: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that can't be right because 488 pages can't have 188 fours. Wait, maybe I'm overcounting.\n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe I'm adding wrong. Let's recalculate.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens blocks, each contributing 1 four, so 48, plus the extra 8 pages where 484 has a 4, so 49 fours.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 fours, so total 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, but that seems high. Let me think: 488 pages, so the maximum number of digits is 3, so total digits are 488*3 = 1464. But I'm only counting the number of 4's, which is 188. That seems plausible.\n\nNow, let me calculate the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, similar to the 4's, but let's see. From 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 48 full tens (1-480), and then 8 more pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full tens, there's one 8, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, in each block of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in the range 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 fours? Wait, no, we're counting 8's. So, yes, 9 times 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place in 401-488 had 9 8's, so 40 + 9 = 49 in tens place. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, no, units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188. So, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing 1 four, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit 4 appears once (484), so total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 fours, so total 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing 1 eight, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit 8 appears once (488), so total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: None, since 488 < 800, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89, yes.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's total: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I feel like 90 might be too high. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately using a formula.\n\nFor any digit d in a certain position, the number of times it appears can be calculated based on higher digits and lower digits.\n\nBut perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, I can think of each digit place separately.\n\nWait, another approach: For each position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 appears and the number of times 8 appears, then sum them up.\n\nLet me try that again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's: For each block of 10, one 4. Total blocks: floor(488 / 10) = 48, with a remainder of 8. So, 48 * 1 = 48, plus in the last partial block (481-488), check if 4 is in the units place. 484 is in this range, so +1. Total: 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's: 48 * 1 = 48, plus in the last block, 488 has 8 in units, so +1. Total: 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: For each block of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100, 10 times 4 in the tens place. Number of full hundreds: floor(488 / 100) = 4, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNumber of 8's: Similarly, for each 100, 10 eights in the tens place. 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but since our book ends at 488, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, so I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I think this approach will make it easier to count without missing any numbers.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4); in 11-20, it appears once (page 14), and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, I can figure out how many complete sets of 10 there are and then see if there's a partial set at the end.\n\nTotal number of complete sets of 10 in 488 pages is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we're dealing with complete sets, it's 48 complete sets, and then 8 extra numbers (from 481 to 488). In each complete set of 10, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the last partial set (481-488), I need to check if there's a 4 in the units place. Looking at 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only number where the units digit is 4. So that's one more 4. Therefore, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 40-49. So, in each set of 100, there are 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete sets of 100 and a partial set of 88 numbers (from 400 to 488). \n\nIn each complete set of 100, there are 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 sets would give 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial set from 400 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. The 4's in the tens place in this partial set would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's using the same method.\n\nStarting with the units place. As before, every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 pages mean 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial set from 481-488: the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is the only number with an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. Therefore, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers every 100 pages, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each set of 100, there are 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 complete sets of 100 in 488 pages, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the partial set from 400-488: the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The 8's in the tens place here would be from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 in 484, total 49. That seems right.\n- Tens place: 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 10 in 440-449, total 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. Total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That adds up.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 in 488, total 49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 9 in 480-488, total 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n- Total 49 + 49 = 98. That adds up.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, yes, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Similarly, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place for 4's: In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each full block, there's one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included. So, that's another 1 occurrence. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place for 4's: In every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such blocks are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so the first block is 1-99, then 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in the 1-99 block, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (40-49). In the 100-199 block, 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349 each contribute 10. Now, the last block is 400-488. Here, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks (including the 1-99 block) each contributing 10, so 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so that's fine. So, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 4's: This occurs only in the numbers 400-488. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place for 8's: Similar to 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 occurrence, so 48. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's another 1 occurrence. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place for 8's: In every block of 100, the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times. So, in 1-99, it's 80-89 (10 times). In 100-199, 180-189 (10). Similarly, 280-289, 380-389, and in 400-488, 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, how many blocks have a full 10 occurrences? The first four blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, the last block (400-488) contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the block 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears 188 times, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full tens blocks (each contributing 1) + 1 in the last partial block = 49.\n- Tens: 5 blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) each contributing 10, except the last one which is only up to 488. Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's fine. So, 5 * 10 = 50.\n- Hundreds: 89 times (from 400 to 488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full tens blocks + 1 in the last partial block = 49.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n- Hundreds: 0, as the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering single-digit page numbers. These are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, the count so far is 4:1, 8:1.\n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place and the units place separately.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers:\n- The tens digit cycles from 1 to 9, each appearing 10 times (e.g., 10-19, 20-29, etc.).\n- So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, there are 10 numbers (40-49), each contributing one 4. That's 10 fours.\n- Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, there are 10 numbers (80-89), contributing 10 eights.\n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers:\n- The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten (e.g., 10-19, 20-29, etc.).\n- So, for each ten, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 14, 24, ..., 94). There are 9 tens (10-99), so that's 9 fours.\n- Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in each ten, so 9 eights.\n\nAdding this up for two-digit numbers:\n- Fours: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- Eights: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\nWait, but hold on, when I consider two-digit numbers, the range is 10-99, which is 90 numbers. So, for the units place, from 10 to 99, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 9 times in the units place. So, 9 fours and 9 eights. That makes sense.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, I have 19 fours and 19 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, and the tens and units digits can vary.\n\nI think I should break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places separately.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place:\n- The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- For each hundreds digit, the number of times it appears is determined by how many numbers are in that hundred. From 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n- So, for the hundreds digit:\n  - 1 appears 100 times (100-199)\n  - 2 appears 100 times (200-299)\n  - 3 appears 100 times (300-399)\n  - 4 appears 89 times (400-488) because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n- So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all because the hundreds digit can't be 8 in this range.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n- The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 10 times for each units digit (0-9).\n- So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly for 8.\n- However, we have to consider that the last hundred (400-488) might not go up to 499, so we need to check if the tens digit for 4 and 8 are fully covered.\n\nWait, let me think again. For the tens place:\n- For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each (once for each units digit).\n- So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n- But for the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digits go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, does the tens digit 8 appear in 480-488? Yes, it does. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 480-488 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for 400-488, the digit 8 appears 9 times, while in the other hundreds, it appears 10 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. The tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the last hundred, and 10 times in each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399).\n\nSimilarly, the digit 4 in the tens place appears 10 times in each hundred, including the last one (400-488), because 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each of the four hundreds, but actually, 400-488 is the fourth hundred, so yes, 10 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the tens digit cycles every 10. So, for the tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's fine.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n- Digit 4 appears 10 times in each of the four hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), so 4 * 10 = 40 fours.\n- Digit 8 appears 10 times in the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and 9 times in the last hundred (400-488), so 3*10 + 9 = 39 eights.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. In 100-199, the tens digit 8 appears in 180-189, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, 280-289, 10 numbers. In 300-399, 380-389, 10 numbers. In 400-488, 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 eights in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the tens place, it's 10 in each hundred, including 400-488, so 4 * 10 = 40 fours.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers:\n- For each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194 in 100-199), and similarly for 8.\n- However, we need to check if in the last hundred (400-488), the units digit 4 and 8 appear the same number of times.\n\nWait, in 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten up to 480-488. So, for each ten, the units digit 4 and 8 appear once each. Let's see:\n\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit 4 appears 10 times, and the same for 8, except in the last hundred, we might have a partial set.\n\nWait, no, because 400-488 includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers. The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, so in each ten, 4 and 8 appear once. Since 89 divided by 10 is 8 full tens and 9 extra numbers. So, for the units digit 4 and 8, in the last hundred, they each appear 8 times in the full tens, and then in the last partial ten (480-488), the units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in total, for the last hundred, units digit 4 appears 8 + 1 = 9 times, and 8 appears 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) and then 480-488. So, in each full ten, 4 and 8 appear once each in the units place, so 8 times each. Then, in 480-488, units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total for units digit 4: 8 + 1 = 9, and for 8: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, in the units place:\n- For the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights.\n- For the last hundred (400-488), it contributes 9 fours and 9 eights.\n- So, total fours in units place: 3*10 + 9 = 39\n- Total eights in units place: 3*10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me check again. For each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, so in each hundred, the units digit 4 appears 10 times. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 fours in the units place. For 400-488, it's 8 full tens (400-479) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. In each full ten, 4 appears once in the units place, so 8 times. Then, in 480-488, 4 appears once (484). So, total in 400-488: 8 + 1 = 9 fours in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place, in each full ten, it appears once, so 8 times, and in 480-488, it appears once (488). So, total 9 eights in the units place for 400-488.\n\nTherefore, total fours in units place across all hundreds:\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nSimilarly, eights in units place:\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\nTotal: 39\n\nSo, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times each.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4:\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 (10 in each of the four hundreds)\n- Units place: 39\nTotal fours in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nFor 8:\n- Hundreds place: 0 (since hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4)\n- Tens place: 39 (10 in first three hundreds, 9 in last)\n- Units place: 39\nTotal eights in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. In the tens place, for 8, it's 10 in each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), which is 3*10=30, plus 9 in the last hundred (400-488), so total 39. Similarly, in the units place, it's 39. So, 39 + 39 = 78. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's add up all the fours and eights from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nTotal fours:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nTotal eights:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with single-digit:\n- 4:1, 8:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- Tens place: 10 fours, 10 eights\n- Units place: 9 fours, 9 eights\nTotal: 19 each\n\nThree-digit:\n- Hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights\n- Tens place: 40 fours, 39 eights\n- Units place: 39 fours, 39 eights\nTotal fours: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal eights: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding up all:\n- Fours: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n- Eights: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers of the 488-page book.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - Digit 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - Digit 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - **Total for Two-Digit Pages:**\n     - 4: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n     - 8: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n     - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times in each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), totaling 40 times.\n     - 8 appears 10 times in the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39 times.\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39 times.\n     - 8 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39 times.\n   - **Total for Three-Digit Pages:**\n     - 4: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n     - 8: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\n4. **Summing Up All Pages:**\n   - **Total 4's:**\n     - Single-digit: 1\n     - Two-digit: 19\n     - Three-digit: 168\n     - **Total:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n   - **Total 8's:**\n     - Single-digit: 1\n     - Two-digit: 19\n     - Three-digit: 78\n     - **Total:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and similarly, the digit 8 appears once. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, for the units place, in each of the 48 complete sets, 4 and 8 each appear once. That gives 48 times for 4 and 48 times for 8 in the units place. Now, for the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding those, the total for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4 and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. Wait, but that can't be right because 488 is included, so maybe I should check that again. Wait, actually, the 48th set ends at 480, so the next set is 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, in 481-488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, the total units digits for 4 is 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (484) = 49. Similarly, for 8, it's 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (488) = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, since the book goes up to 488, we have four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488.\n\nSo, for each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the same for 8. So, that's 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 times each = 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, 440-449 would be where the tens digit is 4, but wait, 401-488 includes 440-449, right? So, that's 10 times. Similarly, for 8, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is included. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 401-488. So, adding that to the previous 40, the total for 4 in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8, it's 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For the tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, yes, 9 times. So, total for tens place: 4's = 40 (from first four hundreds) + 10 = 50; 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me go through each step again.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each ten has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each.\n- The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, 48 + 1 = 49 for 4 and 8, same for 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n- There are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 for each digit.\n- In 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n- The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page.\n- So, total for 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n- For 8: 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0 times. That's correct.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for the last partial hundred. Let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of page numbers is 488. Let's see how many digits are there in total. Pages 1-9: 9 pages, 1 digit each: 9 digits. Pages 10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each: 180 digits. Pages 100-488: 389 pages, 3 digits each: 1167 digits. Total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits. Now, the total number of 4's and 8's should be less than or equal to 1356, but that's a rough check.\n\nWait, but in our calculation, total 4's are 188, 8's are 98. So, 188 + 98 = 286 digits accounted for, which is much less than 1356, so that's fine.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any digits. Each digit is counted in its respective place, so units, tens, hundreds, so no overlap. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a given digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s take N = 488.\n\nFor units place:\n- The number of complete groups of 10 is floor(488 / 10) = 48.\n- Each group contributes 1 occurrence of d in the units place, so 48.\n- Then, the remainder is 488 % 10 = 8.\n- If d <= remainder, add 1 more. So, for d=4, since 4 <=8, add 1. Similarly for d=8, since 8 <=8, add 1.\n- So, units place for 4: 48 + 1 = 49; for 8: 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n- The number of complete groups of 100 is floor(488 / 100) = 4.\n- Each group contributes 10 occurrences of d in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40.\n- The remainder is 488 % 100 = 88.\n- Now, in the current group (the last partial hundred), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 88 is less than 99).\n- The number of times d appears in the tens place in the last partial group is:\n   - If d < current tens digit (which is floor(88 /10) =8), then it's 10 times.\n   - If d == current tens digit, then it's (88 %10) +1 times.\n   - If d > current tens digit, then it's 0.\n- For d=4:\n   - Since 4 <8, it's 10 times in the last partial group.\n   - So, total tens place for 4: 40 +10=50.\n- For d=8:\n   - Since 8 ==8, it's (88%10)+1=8+1=9 times.\n   - So, total tens place for 8:40 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n- The number of complete groups of 1000 is floor(488 /1000)=0.\n- Each group contributes 100 occurrences of d in the hundreds place, but since we have 0 groups, it's 0.\n- The remainder is 488.\n- The hundreds digit in the last partial group is floor(488 /100)=4.\n- So, if d=4, it appears 488 - 400 +1=89 times.\n- If d=8, since 8 >4, it appears 0 times.\n- So, hundreds place for 4:89; for 8:0.\n\nAdding up:\n- For 4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n- For 8:49 +49 +0=98\n- Difference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - **Total:** 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n   - Four full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - In 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 fours, and 480-488 adds 9 eights.\n   - **Total:** 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, contributing 89 fours.\n   - The hundreds digit is never 8.\n   - **Total:** 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 appears 90 more times than the digit 8 in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by calculating how many 4's there are. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4). Similarly, in 11-20, it appears once (at page 14), and so on. \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, the total number of groups of 10 is 48 (because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but we take the integer part). However, the last group (481-488) isn't a complete group of 10, so I need to check if there's an extra 4 in the units place there. Let me see, the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the last group, so 4 does appear once in 484. So, total number of 4's in the units place is 48 groups * 1 = 48, plus 1 from the last partial group, totaling 49.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. If the total number of pages is 488, then the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 48*10=480), and the remaining 8 pages (481-488). So, in the units place, each complete group contributes 1 four, so 48 fours. In the remaining 8 pages, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once more (at 484). So, total units place fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in groups of 100. For example, in 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 occurrences. Similarly, in 140-149, another 10, and so on. \n\nHow many such groups are there up to 488? Let's see: The first group is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), then 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 groups. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all five groups are complete. So, tens place fours: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs from page 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. The count here is from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, hundreds place fours: 89.\n\nAdding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Similar to fours, in each group of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, number of complete groups of 10 is 48, contributing 48 eights. The last partial group is 481-488, which includes 8 in the units place at 488. So, units place eights: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in groups like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last group is 480-488. Let's see how many complete groups there are. The first group is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, the first four groups are complete, each contributing 10 eights, and the last group contributes 9 eights. So, tens place eights: 4*10 +9=40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would occur from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds places with 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours:\n\n- Units: 48 groups of 10, each contributing 1 four, plus 1 in the last partial group: 48+1=49.\n- Tens: 5 groups of 10 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 fours: 5*10=50.\n- Hundreds: 89 numbers from 400-488, each contributing 1 four: 89.\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 48 groups of 10, each contributing 1 eight, plus 1 in the last partial group (488): 48+1=49.\n- Tens: 4 complete groups (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 eights each: 4*10=40. Plus the last group 480-488, which has 9 eights (480-488, but 488 is the last page, so 488 has 8 in the tens place, so from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights. So, total tens eights: 40+9=49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 consecutive numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 4.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 (480 pages), contributing 48 fours.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more four.\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each group of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 5 such groups (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total in tens place: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 each have a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - This is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 contributes 1 occurrence of 8.\n   - 48 complete groups (480 pages) contribute 48 eights.\n   - The remaining pages (481-488) include 488, adding 1 more eight.\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each group of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 complete groups (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 40 eights.\n   - The last group (480-488) has 9 eights (480-488).\n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the digit 8 appears once (e.g., 8, 18, 28, etc.). Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each full block, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and the units digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, the count of 4's and 8's is the same. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit in the tens place appears 10 times in each hundred block. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). \n\nHow many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488. \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the same for 8. So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place and 40 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, looking at the partial hundred from 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, but in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a full hundred, but in this partial block, from 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8. So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits are 0 (for 401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4: that would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times in a full hundred, but in this case, the last set (tens digit 8) only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. For the tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50, and the total number of 8's is 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because the partial hundred is 401-488, which is 88 numbers. So, in the tens place, for each digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? Let me think again.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except for the last one, which only goes up to 488. So, for the tens digit 0: 401-410, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, for tens digit 1: 411-420, 10 times, and so on up to tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this partial hundred.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, adding to the full hundreds: 4 full hundreds contribute 40 each for 4 and 8. Then, the partial hundred adds 10 for 4 and 9 for 8. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has the hundreds digit fixed. So, for each hundred block, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1-488, each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing 1 each, so 48 each. Then, in 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), same for 8 (80-89). So, 4 full hundreds give 40 each. Now, in the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 10 and 9. So, the total for 4's in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8's, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, correct.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: in the hundreds place, only 4 appears, and it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the digits:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nCalculating total 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1-488, there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490, but wait, 488 is less than 490, so actually, it's 48 full decades up to 480, and then 481-488. So, 48 full decades contribute 48 times, and in 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: For each 100 numbers, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. From 1-400, there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 40 times. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nCalculating total 8's:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, each 10 numbers, 8 appears once. From 1-488, 48 full decades contribute 48 times, and in 481-488, 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each 100 numbers, tens digit 8 appears 10 times. From 1-400, 4 full hundreds contribute 40 times. In 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 8 never appears, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach to make sure.\n\nAlternative approach: For each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal number of units digits from 1-488: 488 numbers.\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial block.\n\nNumber of times a digit appears in units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 occurrence per digit, plus the remainder.\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8.\n\nSo, for digits 0-8, each appears 48 + 1 times (since the remainder is 8, digits 1-8 appear one extra time). Wait, no, actually, when you have a remainder of 8, the digits 1-8 in the units place get an extra count. But since we're starting from 1, not 0, the first page is 1, so the units digits go from 1 to 9 in the first block, then 0-9 in each subsequent block.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place = number of complete decades (48) * 1 (for each decade) + extra if d is <= remainder.\n\nWait, but the first block is 1-9, which is a bit different. So, perhaps it's better to separate the first 9 pages and then the rest.\n\nBut maybe this complicates things. Alternatively, let's consider that from 1-488, each units digit from 0-9 appears floor(488 / 10) = 48 times, plus an extra for digits 1-8 because 488 mod 10 = 8, so digits 1-8 get an extra count.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\n- Digits 1-8: 48 + 1 = 49 times each.\n- Digits 9 and 0: 48 times each.\n\nWait, but 0 can't be in the units place for page 1, but from 10 onwards, 0 appears in units place. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't perfect because page 1 is 1, not 01, so the first page is 1, not 01. So, perhaps the count for 0 in the units place is different.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place except for the first block.\n\nFrom 1-9, units digits are 1-9, each appearing once.\n\nFrom 10-488, it's 479 numbers (488 - 9 = 479), which is 47 full decades (10-470) and a partial decade (471-488).\n\nWait, 479 / 10 = 47.9, so 47 full decades and a partial of 9 numbers.\n\nIn each full decade (10-19, 20-29, ..., 470-479), each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, 47 full decades contribute 47 times each for digits 0-9 in the units place.\n\nThen, the partial decade is 471-488, which is 18 numbers (since 488 - 471 + 1 = 18). Wait, no, 471 to 488 is 18 numbers? Let me check: 488 - 471 = 17, plus 1 is 18. So, the units digits here go from 1-8 (since 471 ends with 1, and 488 ends with 8). So, digits 1-8 appear once each, and digits 9 and 0 do not appear in this partial decade.\n\nTherefore, total units place counts:\n\n- For digits 1-8: 1 (from first block) + 47 (from full decades) + 1 (from partial decade) = 49 each.\n- For digits 9 and 0: 1 (from first block) + 47 (from full decades) + 0 (from partial decade) = 48 each.\n\nSo, in the units place, digits 1-8 appear 49 times each, and 0 and 9 appear 48 times each. So, for 4 and 8, which are among 1-8, they each appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-9, the tens digit is 0, so no contribution. From 10-488, we have 479 numbers, which can be broken into hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears equally across the decades.\n\nNumber of full hundreds: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place (e.g., 10-19: tens digit 1, 20-29: tens digit 2, etc.), so 10 times per digit per hundred.\n\nSo, 4 full hundreds contribute 4 * 10 = 40 times each for digits 0-9 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the partial hundred is 401-488, which is 88 numbers. The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except for the last one, which appears 9 times.\n\nWait, no. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for the last, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for digits 0-8, they each appear 10 times in the tens place in the partial hundred, except for 8, which appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers, so 88 / 10 = 8 full decades (401-410, 411-420, ..., 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last decade is 481-488, which is 8 numbers instead of 10.\n\nWait, no, 401-488 is 88 numbers, so 8 full decades (401-410, 411-420, ..., 481-490, but 481-490 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so the last decade is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times in their respective decades (401-410: tens 0, 411-420: tens 1, etc., up to 471-480: tens 7). So, 10 times each.\n\n- For tens digit 8: appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 9 times. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for these 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, perhaps my initial thought was correct.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears in a block of 10 numbers, except the last one, which is shorter.\n\nSo, 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers.\n\n411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers.\n\n...\n\n471-480: tens digit 7, 10 numbers.\n\n481-490: tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. Wait, but 481-490 would be 10 numbers, but we're stopping at 488, so it's 8 numbers. Therefore, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the units place in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so 9 times.\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Let's count:\n\nFrom 401-488:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers.\n\n- 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers.\n\n- 421-430: tens digit 2, 10 numbers.\n\n- 431-440: tens digit 3, 10 numbers.\n\n- 441-450: tens digit 4, 10 numbers.\n\n- 451-460: tens digit 5, 10 numbers.\n\n- 461-470: tens digit 6, 10 numbers.\n\n- 471-480: tens digit 7, 10 numbers.\n\n- 481-490: tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but 480 is included in the previous block (471-480), so 480 has tens digit 8? Wait, no, 480 is part of the 480-488 range. Wait, no, 480 is part of the 480-488 block, which is the last block before 488. So, 480 is included in the tens digit 8 block.\n\nWait, let me list them:\n\n- 480: tens digit 8\n\n- 481: tens digit 8\n\n- 482: tens digit 8\n\n- 483: tens digit 8\n\n- 484: tens digit 8\n\n- 485: tens digit 8\n\n- 486: tens digit 8\n\n- 487: tens digit 8\n\n- 488: tens digit 8\n\nSo, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Therefore, in the partial hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- For digits 0-7: each appears 10 times in the partial hundred.\n\n- For digit 8: appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, from 401-488:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (440-449)\n\n- 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place overall:\n\n- 4 appears 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50 times.\n\n- 8 appears 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 (from partial) = 49 times.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - There are 48 full decades (1-480) contributing 48 occurrences each for 4 and 8.\n   - In the partial decade (481-488), both 4 and 8 appear once.\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each for 4 and 8.\n   - In the partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 for 4 and 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 for 4 and 0 for 8.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 appears 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the single-digit numbers (1-9), the digit 4 appears once. Then, in the two-digit numbers, for every block of 10 numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So from 10-99, there are 9 blocks of 10, but wait, actually, it's 90 numbers, which is 9 blocks of 10. But in each block, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so the digit 4 appears once per block. So that's 9 times in the units place for two-digit numbers. But wait, from 10-99, the units digit 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94). Then, for the three-digit numbers, from 100-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, for each hundred, like 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488, in each hundred, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194). But since we're only going up to 488, the last hundred is 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So in the units place for 400-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So 404, 414, ..., 484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 494, which is beyond 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, so that's 9 times. So adding up, units place: 1 (single-digit) + 9 (two-digit) + 9 (three-digit) = 19 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the three-digit numbers, for hundreds 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 units digits of 4, right? So 100-199: 104,114,...,194 \u2192 10 times. Similarly, 200-299: 204,214,...,294 \u2192 10 times. 300-399: 304,314,...,394 \u2192 10 times. Then 400-488: as before, 9 times. So that's 10+10+10+9=39 times in the units place.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So for the units digit:\n\n- 1-9: 1 time (4)\n- 10-99: 9 times (14,24,...,94)\n- 100-199: 10 times (104,114,...,194)\n- 200-299: 10 times (204,214,...,294)\n- 300-399: 10 times (304,314,...,394)\n- 400-488: Let's see, from 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. So 9 times.\n\nSo total units digit 4's: 1 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but 100-199 is 100 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the units place. Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399. Then 400-488 is 89 numbers, but only 9 times 4 in the units place. So total units digit 4's: 1 + 9 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't have that.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times\n- 140-149: 10 numbers, so 10 times\n- 240-249: 10 times\n- 340-349: 10 times\n- 440-449: 10 times, but wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 10 times.\n\nSo that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 times. Then 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 times.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, but we're interested in how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place, which is once for each number from 400-488. So that's 89 times.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds:\n\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- 1-9: 8 appears once (page 8)\n- 10-99: in each block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place, so 9 blocks (10-99) gives 9 times\n- 100-199: 108,118,...,198 \u2192 10 times\n- 200-299: 208,218,...,298 \u2192 10 times\n- 300-399: 308,318,...,398 \u2192 10 times\n- 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count these. 408 is the first, then 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers. So 9 times.\n\nSo total units digit 8's: 1 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nNow, tens place for 8:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times\n- 180-189: 10 times\n- 280-289: 10 times\n- 380-389: 10 times\n- 480-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but only 480-488 includes the tens digit 8. Wait, actually, in the tens place, 480-488 is part of the 480s, so the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So from 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So that's 9 times.\n\nSo total tens digit 8's: 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8:\n\nIn the hundreds place, 8 appears in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds digit 8's: 0 times.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds:\n\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. So total 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188. So the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits: 1 (1-9) + 9 (10-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 1+9=10, 10+10=20, 20+10=30, 30+10=40, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nTens: 10 (40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits: 1 (8) + 9 (18,28,...,98) + 10 (108,...,198) +10 (208,...,298) +10 (308,...,398) +9 (408,...,488). So 1+9=10, +10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. Correct.\n\nTens: 10 (80-89) +10 (180-189) +10 (280-289) +10 (380-389) +9 (480-488). So 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo difference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount, especially in the higher ranges. Let me verify with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: In each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1-488, how many blocks of 10? 48 full blocks (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). So units digit 4's: 48 times (from 1-480) plus 1 more if 484 is within 481-488, which it is. So 48+1=49. Wait, but earlier I had 49, which matches.\n\nTens place: In each block of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1-488, how many hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-400) and 88 numbers (401-488). So in each hundred, 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So total tens digit 4's: 40+10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, each number has 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 numbers. So 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: Similarly, in each block of 10, 8 appears once. From 1-488, 48 full blocks (1-480) and 8 extra (481-488). So units digit 8's: 48 times (from 1-480) plus 1 if 488 is included, which it is. So 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: In each block of 100, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). From 1-488, how many such blocks? 4 full hundreds (1-400), and in each, 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So 9 more. So total tens digit 8's: 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, no 8's in the hundreds place up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo difference: 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I think this approach will help me avoid missing any numbers and make the counting systematic.\n\nFirst, I'll count the number of 4's in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Since the book goes up to 488, I need to figure out how many such groups there are.\n\nWait, let's see: The total number of pages is 488. So, how many complete groups of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each of these 48 groups, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has ten numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are.\n\nStarting from 40-49: that's one block. Then, 140-149: another. 240-249: another. 340-349: another. 440-449: another. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks is that? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then each hundred has another. So from 0-99: 40-49, that's one. Then 100-199: 140-149, that's two. 200-299: 240-249, three. 300-399: 340-349, four. 400-488: 440-449, five. So, five blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: Here, the digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Let's calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every group of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of ten are there? As before, 48 complete groups (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). So, 48 occurrences of 8 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more (in 488). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in blocks of ten numbers where the tens digit is 8. These blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Let me check how many such blocks there are.\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89, that's one block. 100-199: 180-189, two. 200-299: 280-289, three. 300-399: 380-389, four. 400-488: 480-488, five. So, five blocks in total. Now, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page), so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place there.\n\nSo, calculating the total 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last block, totaling 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 to 899. However, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSubtracting: 187 - 98 = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for both digits. For 4's, in the tens place, I had five blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I had five blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks each contribute 10 8's, so 4\u00d710=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: For 4's, 48 groups of ten, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) don't include a 4 in the units place, so total 48.\n\nFor 8's in the units place: 48 groups of ten, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last group (481-488) includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place: For 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. For 8's, none because 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, yeah, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should check a smaller range to see if my method works. Let's say a 20-page book. How many 4's and 8's?\n\nPage numbers 1-20.\n\n4's: Units place: 4,14 => 2 times. Tens place: 40-49, but 20 is less than 40, so 0. Hundreds place: 0. Total 4's: 2.\n\n8's: Units place: 8,18 => 2 times. Tens place: 80-89, which is beyond 20, so 0. Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's: 2.\n\nDifference: 2 - 2 = 0. That seems correct because in 1-20, 4's and 8's appear the same number of times.\n\nAnother test: 40-page book.\n\n4's: Units place: 4,14,24,34 => 4 times. Tens place: 40-49, but since it's 40, that's 10 times (40-49). So, 4 + 10 = 14 4's.\n\n8's: Units place: 8,18,28,38 => 4 times. Tens place: 40-49 doesn't have 8's in the tens place, but 80-89 is beyond 40, so 0. So, total 8's: 4.\n\nDifference: 14 - 4 = 10. Let me count manually:\n\nPages 1-40:\n\n4's: 4,14,24,34,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49. That's 14 times.\n\n8's: 8,18,28,38. That's 4 times.\n\nDifference: 14 - 4 = 10. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for smaller numbers, so it's likely correct for 488 pages as well.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting Digit 4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** In every group of ten numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete groups of ten (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), contributing 48 occurrences. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any more 4's in the units place. Total: 48.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are five such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences. Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. There are 89 such numbers (488 - 400 + 1). Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting Digit 8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similarly, 8 appears once every ten numbers. With 48 complete groups, that's 48 occurrences. The last group (481-488) adds one more (488). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The first four blocks contribute 10 each (40 total). The last block (480-488) contributes 9. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488). Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** There are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once. So, for 48 complete blocks, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, which is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, actually, the 8's count is 48 (from the complete blocks) plus 1 (from 488), so 49. Similarly, 4's in units place is 48 + 1 (from 484), so 49. So, both 4's and 8's in the units place are 49 each. Hmm, that's interesting. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every block of 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. But wait, actually, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 10 times per hundred. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 10 times per hundred.\n\nSince there are 4 complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and the same for 8's, 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred from 401-488, we need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place. The tens digit in this range is 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). Wait, actually, 481-488 is part of the tens digit 8, so the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488. But how many numbers is that? From 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the partial hundred. But wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for the entire block of 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. So, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480 is part of the previous hundred? No, 401-488 is the partial hundred, so 480 is included here. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But wait, 480 is part of the 401-488 range, so yes, 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Therefore, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial hundred. However, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the partial hundred, 4's in tens place: 10, and 8's in tens place: 9.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place: 4 * 10 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial hundred) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 4 * 10 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from partial hundred) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0, but we don't count it. So, starting from 100 onwards, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book has 488 pages.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 in the hundreds place would require the hundreds digit to be 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8, so 48 each. Then, the partial block 481-488 has 484 and 488, so 1 each. So, total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 to 4 and 10 to 8, so 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), 4's in tens place are from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. 8's in tens place are from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, 40 +9=49 for 8's. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 4's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. 8's in hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. For example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once in the units place for every 10 numbers. So, I can calculate how many times each digit appears in the units place by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering the remainder if necessary.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n\nFor the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 9 appears 100 times in a block of 1000 numbers. But since our book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit will only go up to 4, as 488 is less than 500. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Therefore, each hundreds digit from 1 to 4 appears 100 times except for 4, which might appear fewer times because we don't go up to 499.\n\nWait, actually, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Hmm, but I think I might be complicating things. Maybe I should handle each digit place separately, considering how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me structure this by first calculating the number of 4's and 8's in the units place, then in the tens place, and finally in the hundreds place. Then I can sum them up for each digit and find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor units digit:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers. So, for 488 pages, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Let's divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once as well (8, 18, 28, etc.). So, for each group of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place.\n\nSo, for 48 complete groups, the number of 4's in units place is 48, and the same for 8's. Now, we have 8 extra numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Looking at the units digits here, we have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place contributes equally to both 4's and 8's. Hmm, interesting.\n\nMoving on to the tens place:\n\nFor the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every block of 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per 100 numbers.\n\nNow, our total number of pages is 488, which is 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nSo, for each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Therefore, for each hundred block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSince there are 4 complete hundreds, each digit 4 and 8 will appear 10 times per hundred, so 4*10=40 times each in the tens place from the complete hundreds.\n\nNow, we have the remaining 88 pages: 401-488. Let's see how the tens digit behaves here. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in this range. Specifically, 401-410: tens digit 0; 411-420: tens digit 1; 421-430: tens digit 2; 431-440: tens digit 3; 441-450: tens digit 4; 451-460: tens digit 5; 461-470: tens digit 6; 471-480: tens digit 7; 481-488: tens digit 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: when the tens digit is 4, that's from 441-450, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, that's from 481-488, which is 8 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, in the incomplete hundred block (401-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place:\n\nFor 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nFor 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 48 times. So, 4's have 2 more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is only present in page numbers from 100 onwards. So, for 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're only considering digits 4 and 8, they don't appear in the hundreds place for these pages.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 4 and 8 don't appear here.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, again no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, same thing.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears here. The number of times 4 appears in the hundreds place is the number of pages from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAs for 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. Therefore, 8's count in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place:\n\n4's: 89\n\n8's: 0\n\nNow, let's add up the counts from each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 50\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 48\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nTotal pages 488, so 48 full tens and 8 extra. Each full ten contributes 1 to both 4 and 8 in the units place. So, 48 each, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 each for 4 and 8. 4 hundreds, so 40 each. Then in the last partial hundred (401-488), 4's tens digit occurs 10 times (441-450) and 8's occurs 8 times (481-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's occur 89 times (400-488), 8's don't occur at all. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check again. 188 - 97: 188 - 90 is 98, minus 7 more is 91. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Total page numbers: 488.\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Complete groups of 10: 48, contributing 48 each to 4's and 8's.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute 1 each to 4's and 8's.\n   - Total units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds (4 sets): 40 each for 4's and 8's.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 4's tens digit: 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8's tens digit: 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's appear in 400-488: 89 times.\n   - 8's do not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. I need to figure out how many such groups there are in 488 pages.\n\nWait, but 488 is not a multiple of 10, so I'll have to adjust for the last partial group. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups and 8 extra numbers. So, for the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place = 48 (from the full groups) + 1 (since in the last group, 484 has a 4 in the units place). Wait, no, actually, in the last group from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 full groups give 48 times each for 4 and 8, plus 1 more for each in the last partial group. So, total 49 times each? Wait, no, let me correct that. Each full group of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full groups contribute 48 each. The last partial group (481-488) has 8 numbers, so units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 +1 = 49 for 8. So, same number in units place. Hmm, so no difference there.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), etc., up to 9 (90-99). So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and similarly, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, which is 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, no, 488 is 400 + 88, so actually, 401-488 is 88 pages. So, let me break it down.\n\nFirst, for the hundreds place, but wait, the hundreds place is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, but 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is only 1,2,3,4, none of which are 8. So, hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. That's a difference of 89 right there. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, yes, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 pages. So, that's 89 times 4 in the hundreds place, and 0 times 8. So, that's a big difference already.\n\nNow, moving back to the tens place. Let's calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all page numbers.\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, each of these hundreds contributes 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 4 hundreds (1-400), that's 4 times 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. Now, from 401-488, we have an additional 88 pages. Let's see how the tens digit behaves here.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, the tens digits in 401-488 are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each of these digits appears 10 times except maybe the last one, which might be less because we stop at 488.\n\nWait, 401-410: tens digit is 0 (10 numbers)\n411-420: tens digit is 1 (10 numbers)\n421-430: tens digit is 2 (10 numbers)\n431-440: tens digit is 3 (10 numbers)\n441-450: tens digit is 4 (10 numbers)\n451-460: tens digit is 5 (10 numbers)\n461-470: tens digit is 6 (10 numbers)\n471-480: tens digit is 7 (10 numbers)\n481-488: tens digit is 8 (8 numbers, since 481-488 is 8 pages)\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, adding this to the previous 40 times each from 1-400, we get:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times. So, difference here is 2 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times each, so 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then from 401-488, 441-450 adds 10 more 4's, and 481-488 adds 8 8's. So yes, 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+8=48 for 8's. So, 50 vs 48, difference of +2 for 4's.\n\nNow, let's check the units place again, but wait, earlier I thought both 4 and 8 appeared 49 times each in the units place, but let me confirm that.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\nEach group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, which gives 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48+1=49 for 4, and 48+1=49 for 8. So, same number in units place, no difference.\n\nNow, let's consider the hundreds place again. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1. 200-299: 2. 300-399:3. 400-488:4. So, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 pages (400-488), as we calculated earlier, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's =89, 8's=0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's =49+50+89= 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's=49+48+0=97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the tens place, I had 50 for 4's and 48 for 8's, which is correct. Units place both at 49, hundreds place 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188 for 4's.\n\n49+48+0=97 for 8's.\n\n188-97=91. So, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 40 from 1-400 plus 10=50 for 4's, and 40 plus 8=48 for 8's. Correct.\n\nUnits place:48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each. Then, last partial group 481-488, which adds 1 each. So, 49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I was calculating the tens place from 401-488, I considered that 481-488 has 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, which is correct. So, 8 times in the tens place for 8's in that range.\n\nSimilarly, 441-450 is 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place.\n\nSo, yes, 50 for 4's and 48 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo, final answer:91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full groups, contributing 48 each.\n- The last partial group (481-488) adds 1 each.\n- Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit.\n- From 1-400: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 each.\n- From 401-488: 441-450 adds 10 for 4's, and 481-488 adds 8 for 8's.\n- Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 400-488 (89 pages) contributes 89 for 4's.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n- Total 4's: 89\n- Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Occurrences:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by calculating how many times each digit appears in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each digit separately, first for 4's and then for 8's.\n\nStarting with the 4's:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is the number of such sets. The total number of pages is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is not a multiple of 10, so the last set is 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So, actually, it's 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, plus one more 4 in the 484th page. Wait, no, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but the last page is 488, which is beyond 480. So, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 49. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so that's 48. Then from 481 to 488, the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nBut wait, the book goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449, which is entirely within 488. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, in the units place, 8 appears once in each set of 10, so 48 times, plus one more at 488, so total 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many 8's in the tens place:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 - 480 + 1 = 9)\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so that's correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one '4'. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-480) plus one more '4' at 484, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers have a decade where the tens digit is '4' (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each contributing 10 '4's. There are 5 such decades up to 440-449, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Pages 400-488 each have '4' in the hundreds place, totaling 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting '8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4's, every 10 numbers contribute one '8', totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers have a decade where the tens digit is '8' (80-89, 180-189, etc.), each contributing 10 '8's. The last range is 480-488, contributing 9 '8's, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No pages have '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** Subtract the number of '8's from '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' appears 90 times more than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of times the digit 4 appears. I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. The same goes for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10, and then an extra 8 pages. But since we're only counting the units place, each block contributes one 4. So, 48 times 1 is 48. But wait, the last block goes up to 488, so in the 48th block, we have 480-488. The units digit 4 appears once here as 484. So, that's 48 times in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 0-99), 1, 2, 3, or 4. But the hundreds digit can't be 0 for pages 1-99, but for the tens place, it's still valid. Wait, actually, the tens digit can be 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 times 10 is 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is entirely within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of 8's.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to the 4's, for every block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Plus, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once as 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 instances of the digit 8 in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: 80-89 (first block), 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each with 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 89 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 times (from 4,14,...,484)\n- Tens: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) each contributing 10, so 5*10=50\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers\n\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49 times (48 full blocks, plus 488)\n- Tens: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40\n- Hundreds: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49+40=89.\n\nDifference: 187-89=98.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, there are 98 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 89. The difference is 98.\n\n$\\boxed{98}$"

I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each position across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, every 10 consecutive numbers will have exactly one 4 and one 8. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4) and 8 appears once (page 8). This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. So, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages and then multiply by 1 for each digit (4 and 8).\n\nBut wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and a partial group from 481 to 488. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1 (for each group) plus any extra 4's in the partial group. Let's check the partial group: 481-488. The units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8. So, in each group of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once, so 48 groups give 48 each, and then the last partial group adds one more each, making it 49 for both. So, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Similarly, from 101-200, it's another 10 times each, and so on.\n\nNow, the total number of hundreds in 488 is 4 (since 4*100=400, 5*100=500 which is beyond). So, how many complete hundreds do we have? Let's see:\n\n- From 1-99: tens place for 4 and 8 each appears 10 times.\n- From 100-199: same, 10 each.\n- From 200-299: same, 10 each.\n- From 300-399: same, 10 each.\n- From 400-488: Now, here, the tens place goes from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for 4 and 8 in the tens place, let's see.\n\nWait, but from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, for 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place from 400-488.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, from 400-488, 8 appears 9 times, while 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449).\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For the digit 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is included, so 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, across all page numbers:\n\n- For 1-99: 10 each (4 and 8)\n- 100-199: 10 each\n- 200-299: 10 each\n- 300-399: 10 each\n- 400-488: 10 for 4, 9 for 8.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n- 4's in tens place: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 10*4 +10 = 50.\n\nWait, no, wait: 1-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 for 4's.\n\nFor 8's in tens place:\n\n1-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digits go from 0 (for 1-99) to 4 (for 400-488). So, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 times.\n\nThe digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4's and 8's across all digit positions.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, units place: 488 pages. For units digits, each digit 0-9 appears equally in each position, except possibly the last partial group.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups (each of 10 pages) and 8 remaining pages (481-488). So, in each full group, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 groups * 1 = 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1 =49 for both 4 and 8. That's correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. From 1-99: 10 each. 100-199: 10 each. 200-299:10 each. 300-399:10 each. Now, 400-488: the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449: 10 numbers. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488: 9 numbers. So, 4's in tens place: 10*4 (from 1-399) +10 (from 400-449) = 50. 8's in tens place: 10*4 (from 1-399) +9 (from 480-488) = 49. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488). 8 never appears in hundreds place. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98 =90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by separating the problem into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\nFirst, single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear exactly once. So, for single-digit pages, there's 1 four and 1 eight. So, the difference here is 1 - 1 = 0. So, no difference in single-digit pages.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in both places.\n\nLet's start with the tens place. For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9. So, for the tens digit being 4, the numbers are 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 80 to 89, which is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens group. So, in each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 14, 24, etc.). There are 9 such sets (10-99), so the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the units place (e.g., 18, 28, etc.).\n\nWait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 9 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 9 times each. So, in two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, the difference in two-digit numbers is 19 - 19 = 0. So, again, no difference here.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. These are a bit more complex because each number has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. I need to consider each place separately for digits 4 and 8.\n\nLet's start with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, when the hundreds digit is 4, the numbers range from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest hundreds digit is 4, so 8's don't appear here.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9. Let's break it down:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 100 numbers. In each of these groups, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place: In each group, 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). So, for each of the three groups, that's 10 times each, so 3*10 = 30 times. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: 10 times per group, so 3*10 = 30 times.\n\nNow, for the hundreds group 400-488: The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last number). So, the digit 4 in the tens place would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. The digit 8 in the tens place would be in 480-488, but wait, 488 is the last number, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. Wait, but let me check: From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the end. So, in the hundreds group 400-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- Digit 4: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40 times\n- Digit 8: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. For hundreds groups 1, 2, 3, each has 100 numbers, so 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 3*10=30 each. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total for 4 in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40. For 8: 30 + 9 = 39. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, for each hundreds group, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens group. Let's break it down:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each group has 100 numbers, so in each group, the digit 4 appears in the units place 10 times per ten numbers, so 10 times per group. Since there are three groups, that's 3*10=30 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times per group, so 3*10=30 times.\n\nFor the hundreds group 400-488: The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens group. Let's see how many full tens groups there are. The hundreds group 400-488 includes tens digits from 0 to 8. For each tens digit (0-8), the units digit goes from 0-9. So, for each of these 9 tens groups (0-8), the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so 9 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in each of these 9 tens groups, so 9 times. Wait, but let me check: From 400-488, the last number is 488, so the tens digit goes up to 8, and for each tens digit, units digits go from 0-9 except when the tens digit is 8, where units digits go up to 8 (since 488 is the last number). Wait, no, actually, when the tens digit is 8, the units digits go from 0-8, because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens group 8 (480-488), the units digits go from 0-8, which is 9 numbers. So, in this case, the digit 8 in the units place appears once in each tens group except the last one. Wait, no, actually, for each tens group, regardless of the last number, the digit 4 and 8 in the units place will appear once per tens group, except possibly the last one if it's cut short.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place from 400-488.\n\nThe number of three-digit page numbers is 488 - 100 + 1 = 389, but that's not necessary here. Instead, let's consider the units digit. For each tens group (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488), the units digit cycles 0-9 except for the last group, which might be shorter.\n\nSo, for each of the tens groups from 400-409 up to 470-479, each has 10 numbers, so units digits 0-9. So, in each of these, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. There are 8 such tens groups (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479), so 8 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nThen, the last tens group is 480-488, which has 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the units place, digits 0-8 appear. So, in this group, the digit 4 appears once (484), and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, in this group, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place.\n\nSo, total for the units place in 400-488:\n\n- Digit 4: 8 (from 400-479) + 1 (from 480-488) = 9 times\n- Digit 8: 8 (from 400-479) + 1 (from 480-488) = 9 times\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because from 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in each tens group once, except maybe the last one. Wait, no, actually, in the last tens group (480-488), the units digit 4 appears at 484, so that's one occurrence. Similarly, 8 appears at 488. So, yes, 9 times each.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 400-479, there are 8 tens groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 8 each. Then, in 480-488, we have 484 and 488, so one each. So, total 9 each. So, in the units place for 400-488, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, combining all three-digit numbers:\n\n- Units place: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times for 4\n- Units place: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times for 8\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Wait, earlier I considered that in 100-399, each hundreds group contributes 10 times for each digit in the units place, so 3*10=30 for 4 and 30 for 8. Then, in 400-488, the units place for 4 is 9 times and for 8 is 9 times. So, total units place for 4: 30 + 9 = 39, and for 8: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times, as we calculated, and 8 appears 9 times. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 times\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78 times\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times because from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-399: 3 groups, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place, so 3*10=30 each\n- 400-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place; 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place\nSo, total tens place:\n- 4: 30 + 10 = 40\n- 8: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nIn the units place:\n\n- 100-399: 3 groups, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the units place, so 3*10=30 each\n- 400-488: 400-479 has 8 tens groups, each contributing 1 time for 4 and 1 time for 8 in the units place, so 8 each; and 480-488 contributes 1 each, so total 9 each\nSo, units place:\n- 4: 30 + 9 = 39\n- 8: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nNow, let's sum up all page numbers:\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, in single-digit, 4 and 8 each appear once. Two-digit, 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19; same for 8's. Three-digit: 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168; 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once.\n   - 8 appears once.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n   - Total 4's: 19, Total 8's: 19.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - Total 4's: 168, Total 8's: 78.\n   - Difference: 168 - 78 = 90.\n\n**Total across all pages:**\n- 4's: 188\n- 8's: 98\n- Difference: 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by calculating how many times the digit 4 appears in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for the digit 8. \n\nStarting with the units place for 4's. In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 pages. So, in each full block, the units digit 4 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once (page 484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place for 4's. In every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 40-49, each of those 10 numbers has a 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488. In each full block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times. So, adding that, the total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNext, the hundreds place for 4's. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place for 8's. Similar to 4's, in every block of 10, the digit 8 appears once. So, 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 pages. So, 48 times in the units place, plus once in the partial block (page 488). So, units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place for 8's. In every block of 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, like 80-89. So, 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each contributing 10 times, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place for 8's. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks \u00d7 1 = 48, plus 1 in 481-488, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 full blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 10 in 440-449, total 50.\n- Hundreds: 89 times (400-488).\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks \u00d7 1 = 48, plus 1 in 488, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 full blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.

I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in both places.\n\nStarting with the tens place: The tens digit cycles from 1 to 9. For each tens digit, there are 10 numbers (e.g., 10-19, 20-29, etc.). So, for the tens digit being 4, there are 10 numbers where the tens place is 4: 40-49. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, there are 10 numbers: 80-89. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: For each set of ten numbers (like 10-19), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 14, 24, 34, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (e.g., 18, 28, 38, etc.). Since there are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and the same for 8. Wait, actually, let me correct that. From 10 to 99, there are 9 decades (10-19, 20-29,...,90-99). Each decade has one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 9 times each. So, units place contributes 9 for 4 and 9 for 8.\n\nAdding up the two places for two-digit numbers: Tens place gives 10 for 4 and 10 for 8, units place gives 9 for each. So, total for two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19 for 4, and 10 + 9 = 19 for 8. So, the difference from two-digit numbers is 19 - 19 = 0.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. These have hundreds, tens, and units places. I'll need to analyze each place separately.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 4 appears only in the pages 400-488. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because the highest hundreds digit is 4 (as the book ends at 488). So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. Here, the tens digit can be from 0 to 9 for each hundred. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all three-digit pages from 100 to 488.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. For hundreds digit 1 (100-199):\n   - The tens digit can be 0-9, and for each tens digit, there are 10 units digits (0-9).\n   - So, for each hundreds group (100-199), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149) and similarly for 8 (180-189). So, each contributes 10 counts.\n\n2. For hundreds digit 2 (200-299):\n   - Same as above, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (240-249) and 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\n3. For hundreds digit 3 (300-399):\n   - Again, tens digit 4 appears 10 times (340-349) and 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\n4. For hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n   - Here, the tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can't go beyond 8 because 490-499 would be beyond 488.\n   - So, for tens digit 4 in 400-488: The tens digit is 4, so the numbers are 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, does 449 exist? Since the book ends at 488, 449 is okay because 449 < 488. So, 10 times for 4.\n   - Similarly, for tens digit 8 in 400-488: The numbers would be 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8, but the units digit goes from 0 to 8, which is 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for this group.\n\nSo, adding up the tens place counts:\n\n- For 4: 10 (from 100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40 times.\n- For 8: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. For the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 39 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Here, for each hundreds and tens combination, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each occurrence of the tens digit, the units digit 4 and 8 will each appear once per ten numbers.\n\nLet's again break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1 (100-199):\n   - For each tens digit (0-9), the units digit 4 appears once (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194) and 8 appears once (108, 118, ..., 198).\n   - There are 10 tens digits, so 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2 (200-299):\n   - Same as above: 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3 (300-399):\n   - Again, 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n   - Here, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, as before.\n   - For each tens digit, the units digit 4 and 8 will each appear once, except when the units digit would exceed the page limit (i.e., in 480-488, units digits go only up to 8).\n   - Let's see: For each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times do 4 and 8 appear in the units place?\n   - For tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 numbers, so units digits 0-9. So, 4 and 8 each appear once per tens digit.\n   - For tens digit 8: The units digits go from 0 to 8 (since the last page is 488). So, units digits 4 and 8 will each appear once, except that 8 appears only once (at 488). Wait, no: For tens digit 8, units digits go from 0 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place for tens digit 8.\n   - So, for hundreds digit 4:\n     - Tens digits 0-7: 8 tens digits, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8, so 8 each.\n     - Tens digit 8: 1 each for 4 and 8.\n     - So, total units place counts for 4: 8 + 1 = 9\n     - Similarly, for 8: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. For hundreds digit 4:\n\n- For tens digits 0 to 7: Each has units digits 0-9, so 4 and 8 each appear once per tens digit. There are 8 tens digits (0-7), so 8 times each for 4 and 8.\n- For tens digit 8: Units digits go from 0 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 1 each.\n- So, total for units place in hundreds digit 4: 8 + 1 = 9 for 4, and 8 + 1 = 9 for 8.\n\nSo, adding up all the units place counts:\n\n- For 4: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n- For 8: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier in the tens place, 8 had 39, and now units place also has 39. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. For hundreds digit 4, units place:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: 8 tens digits, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8. So, 8 each.\n- Tens digit 8: 1 each for 4 and 8.\n- So, total units place for 4: 8 + 1 = 9\n- Similarly, for 8: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nSo, adding across all hundreds:\n\n- 100-199: 10 each\n- 200-299: 10 each\n- 300-399: 10 each\n- 400-488: 9 each\n- Total for units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 for both 4 and 8.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent because in the tens place, 8 had 39, and units place also 39, but 4 had 40 in tens and 39 in units. Wait, no, let me re-examine.\n\nWait, no, in the tens place, for 4, it was 40 times, and for 8, it was 39 times. In the units place, both 4 and 8 have 39 times. So, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nWait, that seems off because 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 for 4's, and 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 for 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. For hundreds digit 4, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40 times. Correct.\n\nIn the units place, for 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times\n- Units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times\n- So, total 8's: 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, but that doesn't include the hundreds place, which is 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nNow, adding up all the digits from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n- 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 = 90, which seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in adding up the three-digit counts. Let me go back.\n\nWait, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n- 8's: hundreds place (0) + tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit:\n\n- 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) = 20\n- 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) = 20\n\nSo, total 4's: 20 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 20 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check if I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, for the units place, I think I might have double-counted. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, no, the units place in three-digit numbers is correctly calculated as 39 for both 4 and 8. Similarly, tens place for 4 is 40 and for 8 is 39.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit units place again.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1, 2, 3: Each has 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the units place, so 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 each.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: units place for 4 is 9 times, as calculated earlier, and same for 8.\n\nSo, total units place for 4: 30 + 9 = 39\nSimilarly, units place for 8: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nSame for tens place:\n\n- For 4: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40\n- For 8: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- single-digit:1\n- two-digit:19\n- three-digit:168\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\n- single-digit:1\n- two-digit:19\n- three-digit:78\nTotal:1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly in the three-digit numbers. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: Instead of breaking it down into single, two, and three-digit numbers, perhaps I can consider all page numbers from 1 to 488 and count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\nSo, for each digit place, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet's start with the units place.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor numbers from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n\nTotal number of complete blocks of 10 in 488 numbers: 48 full blocks (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each block of 10, units digits 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 \u00d7 1 = 48 times each.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488): The units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total units place:\n\n- 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 for three-digit units place. Hmm, perhaps this method is more accurate.\n\nWait, but in the previous method, I had 39 for three-digit units place, but this method gives 49. There's a discrepancy here. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the previous method was wrong because I was only considering three-digit numbers, but this method includes all numbers from 1-488, which includes single and two-digit numbers as well. So, perhaps this is a better approach.\n\nSimilarly, let's do the same for tens place.\n\nTens place:\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nSo, for numbers 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there?\n\n- 1-99: 100 numbers\n- 100-199: 100 numbers\n- 200-299: 100 numbers\n- 300-399: 100 numbers\n- 400-488: 89 numbers\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\nIn each complete hundred (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each digit 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for each hundred, 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8.\n\nSo, for 4 hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nNow, for the incomplete hundred (400-488), which has 89 numbers. The tens digits here go from 0-8 (since 488 is the last number). So, for each tens digit from 0-8, the tens digit appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, in the tens place for 400-488:\n\n- Tens digit 4: appears 10 times (440-449)\n- Tens digit 8: appears 9 times (480-488)\n- Other digits: irrelevant for our count.\n\nSo, in the incomplete hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n- 4's: 4 \u00d7 10 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 400-449) = 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because 400-488 is part of the three-digit numbers, but when considering all numbers up to 488, the tens digit in 400-488 is as above.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The tens digit in 400-488:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each appears 10 times (e.g., 400-409, 410-419,...,470-479)\n- For tens digit 8: Appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, for 4's in tens place:\n\n- In complete hundreds (1-399): 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n- In 400-488: tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449)\n- So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n\nFor 8's in tens place:\n\n- In complete hundreds: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n- In 400-488: tens digit 8 appears 9 times\n- So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nNow, units place:\n\nAs calculated earlier, units place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: 100-199, 100 numbers. So, 1 appears 100 times in the hundreds place.\n- Similarly, 2 appears 100 times in 200-299.\n- 3 appears 100 times in 300-399.\n- 4 appears 89 times in 400-488.\n\nSo, for 4's in hundreds place: 89 times\nFor 8's in hundreds place: 0 times, since the highest hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, adding up all digit places:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was breaking it down into single, two, and three-digit numbers, I also got 188 - 98 = 90. So, that seems consistent.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the units place calculation.\n\nWait, in the units place, using the block method, I had 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, total units place:48 +1 =49 each.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, using the hundreds block method, each complete hundred contributes 10 each for 4 and 8. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 4\u00d710=40 each. Then, in 400-488, tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place:40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n8's:49 +49 +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier when I broke it down into single, two, and three-digit numbers, I also got the same result, so I think it's correct.\n\nBut let me just verify with a smaller example to see if the method is correct.\n\nSuppose we have a 28-page book. Let's count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nPage numbers:1-28.\n\n4's: page 4,14,24 \u2192 3 times\n8's: page 8,18,28 \u21923 times\nDifference:0\n\nUsing the method:\n\nUnits place:\n- Blocks of 10:2 full blocks (1-10,11-20). Each contributes 1 to 4 and 1 to 8. So, 2 each.\n- Remaining 8 pages (21-28): units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (24), 8 appears once (28)\nTotal units:2+1=3 each\n\nTens place:\n- Blocks of 100: not applicable here.\n- For 1-28, the tens digits are 0-2.\n- For tens digit 4: none, so 0\n- For tens digit 8: none, so 0\nWait, but in 1-28, the tens digits are 0 (1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-28). So, 4 and 8 don't appear in the tens place.\nSo, tens place:0 each.\n\nHundreds place:0 each.\n\nSo, total 4's:3, 8's:3. Difference:0. Correct.\n\nAnother test: book with 48 pages.\n\n4's: pages 4,14,24,34,44 \u21925 times\n8's: pages 8,18,28,38,48 \u21925 times\nDifference:0\n\nUsing the method:\n\nUnits place:\n- Blocks of 10:4 full blocks (1-10,11-20,21-30,31-40). Each contributes 1 to 4 and 1 to 8. So, 4 each.\n- Remaining 8 pages (41-48): units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (44), 8 appears once (48)\nTotal units:4+1=5 each\n\nTens place:\n- Blocks of 100: not applicable.\n- For 1-48, the tens digits are 0-4.\n- Tens digit 4: appears in 40-48, which is 9 numbers. So, tens digit 4 appears 9 times.\n- Tens digit 8: doesn't appear because the highest tens digit is 4.\nSo, tens place:9 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:0 each.\n\nSo, total 4's:5 (units) +9 (tens) =14\n8's:5 (units) +0 (tens)=5\nWait, but that contradicts the actual count where 4's and 8's are both 5.\n\nWait, so there's a mistake in this method. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 1-48, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-48, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (5) + tens (9) =14\n8's: units (5) + tens (0)=5\nSo, difference:14-5=9\n\nBut in reality, 4's and 8's are both 5, so difference is 0.\n\nThis suggests that the method is overcounting 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, so where's the mistake?\n\nAh, I think I'm confusing the tens digit in the page numbers with the actual digit counts. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 1-48:\n\n- Pages 1-9: tens digit is 0, so 0 times for 4 and 8.\n- Pages 10-19: tens digit 1, so 0 times for 4 and 8.\n- Pages 20-29: tens digit 2, so 0 times.\n- Pages 30-39: tens digit 3, so 0 times.\n- Pages 40-48: tens digit 4, which appears 9 times (40-48).\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's:9, 8's:0.\n\nBut in reality, in the page numbers, the digit 4 appears 5 times, and 8 appears 5 times.\n\nSo, the method is overcounting because it's considering the tens digit, but the actual count of 4's and 8's is based on all digit places.\n\nWait, so perhaps the method should be to count each digit place separately, but not add them up as separate counts.\n\nWait, in the 48-page example, using the digit place method:\n\nUnits place:5 each\nTens place:9 for 4, 0 for 8\nHundreds place:0 each\n\nSo, total 4's:5 (units) +9 (tens) =14\n8's:5 (units) +0 (tens) =5\nDifference:9\n\nBut actual count is 5 each, so difference 0.\n\nThis suggests that the method is incorrect because it's treating each digit place separately and adding them, but in reality, each page number is a number, and the digits are part of the same number.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is that in the tens place, when we count 9 times for 4, we're counting the digit 4 in the tens place, but in reality, each occurrence is a separate digit, so it's correct to add them.\n\nWait, but in the 48-page example, the actual number of 4's is 5, but the method gives 14. So, clearly, the method is wrong.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because in the 48-page example, the 4's in the units place are 4,14,24,34,44:5 times. The 4's in the tens place are 40-48:9 times, but that's 9 times the digit 4 in the tens place, which would be pages 40,41,...,48, which is 9 pages where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 9 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nBut in reality, in the page numbers, the digit 4 appears 5 times in the units place and 9 times in the tens place, totaling 14 times. But when I manually counted earlier, I thought it was 5 times. Wait, no, that's incorrect.\n\nWait, let me recount for 48 pages:\n\nPage numbers:\n\n4,14,24,34,44 \u21925 times in units place.\n\nPlus, in the tens place:40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48 \u21929 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:5 +9=14.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\n8,18,28,38,48 \u21925 times in units place.\n\nIn the tens place: none, since the tens digits go up to 4.\n\nSo, total 8's:5.\n\nSo, difference:14-5=9.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 0, but that was incorrect. So, the method is correct, and the difference is indeed 9.\n\nSo, in the 48-page example, the method works correctly.\n\nSo, returning to the original problem, the difference is 90.\n\nThus, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe difference between the number of 4's and 8's printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book is calculated by analyzing each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n- **Units Place**: 49 times for 4, 49 times for 8.\n- **Tens Place**: 50 times for 4, 49 times for 8.\n- **Hundreds Place**: 89 times for 4, 0 times for 8.\n\nAdding these up:\n- Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n- Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and an extra 8 pages. In each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 4 once (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, each 4 in the tens place occurs for ten consecutive numbers. For example, 40-49 have the tens digit as 4. How many such groups are there up to 488? Let's see: from 1-99, there's one group (40-49), and from 100-488, there's another group (400-409) and another (440-449). Wait, no, 440-449 is part of 400-499, but since our book ends at 488, the last group is 480-489, but we only go up to 488. So, let me correct that. From 1-99, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 pages. From 100-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 440-449, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, let's count each occurrence:\n\n- 40-49: 10 pages\n- 140-149: 10 pages\n- 240-249: 10 pages\n- 340-349: 10 pages\n- 400-409: 10 pages\n- 440-449: 10 pages\n- 480-488: 9 pages (since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, but from 1-99, it's 40-49: 10 pages. Then from 100-399, each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has a 40-49 in the tens place, so that's 3 more groups of 10 pages each. Then from 400-488, we have 400-409, 440-449, and 480-488. Wait, but 400-409 is 10 pages, 440-449 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9 pages. So, adding them up: 10 (from 40-49) + 3*10 (from 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) + 10 (400-409) + 10 (440-449) + 9 (480-488) = 10 + 30 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 69. So, 69 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 1-99, 40-49: 10. Then each hundred block from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has a 40-49 in the tens place, so 3 more sets of 10, totaling 10 + 3*10 = 40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 440-449, and 480-488. So that's 10 + 10 + 9 = 29. So total tens place 4's would be 40 + 29 = 69. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (69) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 69 = 118, 118 + 89 = 207. So, 207 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in every set of ten pages, the units digit is 8 once. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 8 once (page 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit being 8, each occurrence is in a block of ten numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's count how many such blocks exist up to 488.\n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89: 10 pages.\nFrom 100-199: 180-189: 10 pages.\nFrom 200-299: 280-289: 10 pages.\nFrom 300-399: 380-389: 10 pages.\nFrom 400-488: 480-488: 9 pages (since 488 is the end).\n\nSo, adding these up: 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 207 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 109.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens + 1 extra (484) = 49\n- Tens: 10 (40-49) + 3*10 (140-149, 240-249, 340-349) + 10 (400-409) + 10 (440-449) + 9 (480-488) = 10 + 30 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 69\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal: 49 + 69 + 89 = 207\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens + 1 extra (488) = 49\n- Tens: 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 207 - 98 = 109\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 109 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of ten (1-480) contribute 48 occurrences. The last 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349 each contribute 10, totaling 40. From 400-488, 400-409, 440-449 contribute 10 each, and 480-488 adds 9, totaling 29. Combined, 40 + 29 = 69.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 contributes 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 69 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **207**.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of ten contribute 48 occurrences. The last page (488) adds 1, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10, totaling 40. From 400-488, 480-488 adds 9. Combined, 40 + 9 = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 207 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **109**.\n\n$\\boxed{109}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place (units, tens, hundreds), I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in that specific position across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once and 8 appears once in the units place for each block of 10.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, for each complete block of 10, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times 4's and 48 times 8's in the units place. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial block, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal, each appearing 49 times.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100. For example, in the numbers 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each block of 100, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, which means there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 complete blocks, that's 4 times 10 = 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place and 40 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the partial block from 401-488, we need to check the tens digit. The numbers 401-488 can be broken down as 400-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nIn the tens place, for 400-409: the tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8 here.\nFor 410-419: tens digit is 1, no 4 or 8.\nSimilarly, 420-429: tens digit 2, 430-439: 3, 440-449: 4, 450-459:5, 460-469:6, 470-479:7, 480-488:8.\n\nSo, in the tens place in the partial block:\n\n- The digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- The digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page), so 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, total in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 (from partial block) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from complete blocks) + 9 (from partial block) = 49\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. Each digit in the hundreds place appears for a block of 100 numbers. For example, 1 appears in 100-199, 2 in 200-299, 3 in 300-399, and 4 in 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- The digit 1 appears from 100-199: 100 numbers, so 100 times.\n- Similarly, 2 appears 100 times, 3 appears 100 times.\n- The digit 4 appears from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, checking if 8 appears in the hundreds place: 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's:\n\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8, so 48 each. Then the partial block from 481-488, which adds 1 to each, so units place: 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete block of 100 contributes 10 to 4's and 10 to 8's. So, 4 blocks give 40 each. The partial block from 401-488: 440-449 gives 10 to 4's, and 480-488 gives 9 to 8's. So, tens place: 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's. That adds up correctly.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0. That's correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check each part.\n\nUnits place: Each 10 numbers, 1 each for 4 and 8. 48 full blocks, so 48 each, plus the last 8 numbers (481-488) where units digits are 1-8. So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, units: 48+1=49 for 4's, and 48+1=49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each 100 numbers, 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 blocks of 100, 10 each, so 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times 4. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times 8. So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, 40+9=49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4. 800-899 would be needed for 8's, but since the book ends at 488, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, 0 for 8's. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49+0=98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n- Total complete blocks of 10: 48 \u2192 48 occurrences each of 4 and 8.\n- Partial block (481-488): 484 (1 occurrence of 4) and 488 (1 occurrence of 8).\n- Total: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49; 8's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n- Complete blocks of 100: 4 \u2192 40 occurrences each of 4 and 8.\n- Partial block (401-488): 440-449 (10 times 4) and 480-488 (9 times 8).\n- Total: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50; 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears in 400-488 (89 times).\n- 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n- Total: 4's = 89; 8's = 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, in the units place of the extra 8 numbers, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, adding that to the previous count, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's is 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Hmm, so in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. So, no difference there.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 0-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. Now, considering the entire 488 pages, how many hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. Wait, but actually, we can think of it as 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488). So, in each complete hundred, the digit in the tens place cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Therefore, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 for each digit in the tens place.\n\nNow, we need to check the additional 88 pages, which are from 401 to 488. Let's break this down. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each digit appear? Well, for each tens digit, there are 10 numbers (e.g., 401-410 have tens digit 0, 411-420 have tens digit 1, etc.). But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last set is 481-488, which is only 8 numbers. So, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). Let's count how many times each digit appears in the tens place in this range.\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480 \u2192 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488 \u2192 8 numbers\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the tens place in the 441-450 range, which is 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place in the 481-488 range, which is 8 times. Therefore, in the additional 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nAdding this to the previous count from the complete hundreds: 40 (from 4 hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 times for 4 in the tens place. For 8, it's 40 + 8 = 48 times in the tens place. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. That means there are 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. The hundreds digit cycles every 1000 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Each of these digits appears 100 times in the hundreds place, except for 4, which appears only 88 times because we're stopping at 488 instead of 500. Wait, no, let me think again. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, which is 100 times. Similarly, 200-299 is 100 times for 2, 300-399 is 100 times for 3, and 400-488 is 89 times for 4 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? 89 times. How about 8? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but since our book only goes up to 488, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the count for 8 in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, that's 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow for 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- For units, I had 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) contributed one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, 48 +1 =49 for both. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- For the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 =40 for each digit. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For 4, it's 10 times in 441-450, and for 8, it's 8 times in 481-488. So, 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +8=48 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- For 4, it's 89 times (400-488). For 8, it's 0 times. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97\nDifference:188 -97=91\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, when I was counting 401-488, I considered that the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again. 49 +50 +89=188 and 49+48=97. So, 188-97=91. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the units place again. When I have 488 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the last partial block. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, that adds 1 each, making it 49 for both. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears 8 times. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times in 441-450, and for 8, it's 8 times in 481-488. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I add the counts for the tens place, I have 40 (from 1-400) +10=50 for 4, and 40 +8=48 for 8. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+48+0=97. Difference is 91.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I've double-counted some numbers? For example, in 444, the digit 4 appears three times, but I've counted each occurrence in units, tens, and hundreds place separately, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in 488, the digit 8 appears twice, but I've counted each occurrence in tens and units place, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've correctly accounted for all the page numbers. The book has 488 pages, so the last page is 488, which is included. So, when I count from 1 to 488, I've included all the necessary digits.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits printed. Let's see, from 1-9: 9 digits. From 10-99: 90 numbers \u00d72 digits=180 digits. From 100-488: 389 numbers \u00d73 digits=1167 digits. Total digits:9+180+1167=1356 digits.\n\nBut maybe that's not necessary for this problem. I just want to make sure that my counts for 4's and 8's are correct.\n\nWait, let me think about the hundreds place again. From 1-99, there's no hundreds digit, so 0 for both 4 and 8. From 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 0 for 4 and 8. Similarly, 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so 0 for both. 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so 0 for both. 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times for 4, and 0 for 8. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-99, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times. From 100-488, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, 4 appears 10 times per hundred in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times per hundred. From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4\u00d710=40 for each digit in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, as I calculated earlier, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, that's correct.\n\nIn the units place, from 1-488, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial block. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units digits for 4:48+1=49, same for 8.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. 8's:49 (units)+48 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=97. So, difference is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again: 49+50=99, plus 89=188. For 8's:49+48=97. 188-97=91. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's handle the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for the units digit, the number of times 4 appears is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in the total page numbers, plus any extra in the incomplete group if there is one. Similarly for 8.\n\nWait, but I need to consider all page numbers up to 488. Let me see how many complete groups of 10 there are and if there's an incomplete group.\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. So, for the units digit, the number of 4's is 48 * 1 = 48, and the same for 8's, so 48 as well. But wait, in the incomplete group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at 484. So that's one more 4. Similarly, does 8 appear? Yes, at 488. So that's one more 8. So, total units digit 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The last page is 488, so the last page in the incomplete group is 488, which is the 8th number after 480. So, numbers 481 to 488 have units digits 1 through 8. So yes, 484 is included, so 4 appears once, and 488 is included, so 8 appears once. So, yes, 49 each.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, ..., 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many hundreds do we have in 488 pages? We have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, let's calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFirst, in each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.), same for 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nWe have 4 complete hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place from the complete hundreds.\n\nNow, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nThe tens digits in 401-488 are 0 (for 401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except possibly the last one if the total pages don't reach the next hundred. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the tens digit goes up to 8, but how many numbers have tens digit 8? From 480-488, but wait, 480 is part of the previous hundred? Wait, no, 401-488 is the incomplete hundred, so 401-488 is 88 pages. So, the tens digits in 401-488 go from 0 (401-410) which is 10 numbers, 1 (411-420), another 10, and so on up to 8 (481-488), which is 8 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 481-490 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, but wait, 480 is part of the 401-488 range. Wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, so 401 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, the tens digits in 401-488: 0 (401-410: 10 numbers), 1 (411-420: 10), 2 (421-430: 10), 3 (431-440: 10), 4 (441-450: 10), 5 (451-460: 10), 6 (461-470: 10), 7 (471-480: 10), and 8 (481-488: 8 numbers). So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in 441-450, and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, so from 401 to 488, the tens digits go up to 8, but the number of times each digit appears varies. For digits 0 through 7, each appears 10 times because each ten's place has exactly 10 numbers. But for digit 8, since we only go up to 488, which is 8 numbers (481-488), so 8 times.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let me confirm: 401 to 488 inclusive is 488 - 400 = 88 pages. So, each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times (0:401-410, 1:411-420, etc.), and the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (in 441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (in 481-488).\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the incomplete hundred, total 50.\n\nTens digit 8's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 8 in the incomplete hundred, total 48.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, let's move to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Pages 1-99 have hundreds digit 0, so we don't count those. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWait, 100-199: hundreds digit 1\n\n200-299: hundreds digit 2\n\n300-399: hundreds digit 3\n\n400-488: hundreds digit 4\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have hundreds digit 8, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nTherefore, hundreds digit 4's: 89\n\nHundreds digit 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits.\n\nFirst, total 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 50\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 48\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the difference is total 4's minus total 8's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits digit:\n\n- Complete groups of 10: 48, each contributing 1 to 4 and 8, so 48 each.\n\n- Incomplete group: 481-488, units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488). So, 49 each.\n\nTens digit:\n\n- Complete hundreds: 4, each contributing 10 to 4 and 8, so 40 each.\n\n- Incomplete hundred (401-488):\n\n  - Tens digit 4: 10 times (441-450)\n\n  - Tens digit 8: 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something in the tens place for the incomplete hundred. Let me check again.\n\nIn the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but how many times does each digit appear?\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers\n\n411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers\n\n421-430: tens digit 2, 10 numbers\n\n431-440: tens digit 3, 10 numbers\n\n441-450: tens digit 4, 10 numbers\n\n451-460: tens digit 5, 10 numbers\n\n461-470: tens digit 6, 10 numbers\n\n471-480: tens digit 7, 10 numbers\n\n481-488: tens digit 8, 8 numbers\n\nSo, yes, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, the tens digit counts are correct.\n\nAnother way to check: total numbers in incomplete hundred is 88, which is 8 hundreds. Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 88 = 8*11, but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in the hundreds place, the 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 97, so the difference is 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when counting digits, especially in different places, it's easy to miscount, especially in the incomplete groups. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternative method: For each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For each page number, the units digit cycles every 10. So, total units digits from 1 to 488.\n\nNumber of complete cycles: 488 // 10 = 48, with remainder 8.\n\nEach complete cycle has one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 * 1 = 48 each.\n\nIn the incomplete cycle (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, same for 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each tens digit repeats every 100 numbers. For each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nTotal hundreds: 4 complete (1-400), plus 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 each.\n\nIn the incomplete hundred (401-488):\n\n- Tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\n- For each tens digit d, the number of times it appears is 10 if d < 8, because 401-488 includes 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, no, in the incomplete hundred, each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, in the incomplete hundred:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 10 times (441-450)\n\n- Tens digit 8: 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, total tens 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n\nTotal tens 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- From 1-99: hundreds digit 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n\n- From 100-488: hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n- 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, hundreds 4's: 89\n\nHundreds 8's: 0\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 97 times. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, for the units place. In every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 10 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The page numbers go up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're considering three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit starts from 1. Wait, actually, page numbers start from 1, so the first block where the tens digit is 4 is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. However, we need to check if 440-449 is fully included in 488 pages. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's included. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers, meaning 89 occurrences of the digit 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's printed is 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 complete blocks and 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each complete block gives one 8, so 48 times. In the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, adding one more 8. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. However, since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Each full block (like 80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place, but the last block only contributes 9. So, how many full blocks are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, the last partial block (480-488) contributes 9 8's. So total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be for numbers from 800 to 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's printed is 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks (480) + 1 in 481-488: 49\n- Tens: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each with 10 4's: 5*10=50\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks + 1 in 481-488: 49\n- Tens: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) with 10 each: 40, plus 9 in 480-488: total 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSubtracting: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's right. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this, maybe by using a formula or a different counting method, but I think the way I did it is thorough and correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once and the digit 8 appears once. I need to figure out how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many complete tens are in 488. Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). So, in each of these 48 groups, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. That gives us 48 times each for both digits in the units place.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in the units place of these, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49) and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nSince our book has 488 pages, we can think of it as 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, actually, 488 is 4*100 + 88, so that's correct.\n\nIn each of the four complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times. So, for four hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times each. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. Let's break this down:\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0\n411-420: tens digit is 1\n421-430: tens digit is 2\n431-440: tens digit is 3\n441-450: tens digit is 4\n451-460: tens digit is 5\n461-470: tens digit is 6\n471-480: tens digit is 7\n481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 488 is only up to 488, so the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, not a full 10. So, in the tens place, for 401-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times. The digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times because there are only 8 numbers there (481 to 488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, adding this to our previous counts:\n\nFor 4's in tens place: 4*10 (from the four complete hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 4*10 (from the four complete hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Each complete hundred contributes 10 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, four hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), we have:\n\n- For 4's in tens place: 441-450, which is 10 times.\n- For 8's in tens place: 481-488, which is 8 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nOkay, so in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the hundreds digit is the same for all 100 pages. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, actually, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Looking at the page numbers, the hundreds digit cycles from 1 to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest page number is 488, which is in the 400s. So, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 times\n- 8's: 0 times\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences of 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 49 + 48 is 97. So, 8's total is 97.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the units place, both 4's and 8's had 49 each. Then, in the tens place, 4's had 50 and 8's had 48. So, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188 and the total number of 8's is 97. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the units place. So, in the units place, for each group of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once. There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 480 pages, so 48 times each. Then, from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4's and 8's. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each complete hundred contributes 10 times for 4's and 10 times for 8's in the tens digit. So, four complete hundreds (1-400) give 40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50; 8's: 40 + 8 = 48. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8's don't appear in the hundreds place at all, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting, especially in the tens place, I might have missed something. Let me recount the tens place for the partial hundred (401-488).\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go through 0-8, but only up to 488. So, let's list the ranges:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, yes, that's correct. So, 4's: 10, 8's:8.\n\nSo, adding to the four complete hundreds: 40 each, plus 10 and 8, giving 50 and 48 respectively.\n\nTherefore, the total counts are as above.\n\nSo, the difference is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in all page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, and the digit 8 appears 97 times. Therefore, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, 4 and 8 each appear exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4) and 8 appears once (at page 8). This pattern repeats every 10 pages.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages (481-488). So, in each complete block, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. Therefore, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times 1, which is 48. Similarly, the number of 8's in the units place is also 48.\n\nBut wait, there's an extra partial block from 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits here: 481 ends with 1, 482 with 2, up to 488 with 8. So, in this partial block, the units digits go from 1 to 8. Therefore, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these to the previous counts, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, I'll move on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So, for 4 complete blocks, that's 4 times 10 = 40 for each digit.\n\nNow, the partial block is from 401 to 488. Let's look at the tens place here. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in this range. So, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 481-488, which has only 8 numbers, but the tens digit is still 8 for all of them.\n\nSo, in the partial block, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, our partial block starts at 401, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's another 10 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in the tens place, it's 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so that's 9 times (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. Wait, no, actually, each page from 480 to 488 has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 times, right? Because 480 is the first, and 488 is the last, so that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488.\n\nWait, no, that's 9 numbers? Let me count: 480 is 1, 481 is 2, up to 488, which is 9th number. So, yes, 9 times. So, in the partial block, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, total for the tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 (from partial block) = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. The complete blocks contribute 40 each for 4 and 8. Then, in the partial block, 4's tens digit appears 10 times (440-449), and 8's tens digit appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place:\n\n- Units place: 49 - 49 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 49 = 1\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages, so for units digit, each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10) = 48 times, with a remainder of 8. So, for each digit, 48 times, plus 1 if the digit is \u22648, because the remainder is 8. So, for 4, since 4 \u22648, it's 48 +1 =49. Similarly, 8 is also \u22648, so 48 +1=49. So that's correct.\n\nTens place: Each digit in tens place appears 10 times per hundred. So, for 488 pages, how many hundreds? 488 /100 =4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times for each digit in tens place. So, 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8.\n\nThen, in the partial hundred (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 times. So, 40 +10=50 for 4.\n\nFor 8 in tens place, it's 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 times (480-488). So, 40 +9=49 for 8. So, the difference here is 50-49=1.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place, so 89-0=89.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 times. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\nThe total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nWait, 188 -98=90. So, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nCalculating total 4's:\n\n- Units place: As above, 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49=98\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. For each place, I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and an additional 8 numbers. In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional in the incomplete group. The incomplete group is 481 to 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. In this, the digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So, the units place contributes equally to both 4's and 8's.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each group of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.) and 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds and an additional 88 numbers. In each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages and 8 for 10 pages. So, for the tens place, 4's: 4 * 10 = 40. Similarly, 8's: 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the incomplete hundred is from 400 to 488. Let's look at the tens digit in this range. The tens digit can be 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, in the 400-488 range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's only in 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the incomplete hundred, 4's in tens place: 10 (440-449). 8's in tens place: 9 (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50. 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. So, 4's have 50 and 8's have 49 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 4's in hundreds place: 89. 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- 48 complete groups of 10: 48 * 1 = 48 for both 4 and 8.\n- Incomplete group (481-488): 484 and 488, so 1 each. So total 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Complete hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8.\n- Incomplete hundred (400-488):\n  - 440-449: 10 times for 4.\n  - 480-488: 9 times for 8.\nSo, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50; 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n- No 8's in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each 10-number block contributes 1 '4'. There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and an additional 8 pages (481-488). The 480th page is 480, so the 481-488 block includes 484, adding 1 more '4'. Total = 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, each 10-number block contributes 1 '8'. The 488th page adds another '8'. Total = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each 100-number block has 10 '4's in the tens place. There are 4 complete blocks (400 pages) contributing 40 '4's. The incomplete block (400-488) includes 440-449, adding 10 '4's. Total = 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **8's:** Each 100-number block has 10 '8's. The incomplete block includes 480-488, which is 9 '8's. Total = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Pages 400-488 have 89 '4's in the hundreds place.\n   - **8's:** No pages have '8' in the hundreds place.\n\nSumming up:\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. How many such sets are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll take the integer part, which is 48 full sets. Each of these sets contributes 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, from 1 to 488, the last set is from 481 to 490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 appears in 484, 485, ..., 494, but wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 480-488 range, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So actually, each full set contributes 1, and the partial set from 481-488 adds another 1. So total units place 4's would be 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (from 481-488), totaling 49.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to how many times 4 is in the units digit across all numbers. For every 10 numbers, it's once. So total number is floor(488/10) = 48 times, but since 488 is the last number, and 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within 480-488. So actually, from 1-480, it's 48 times, and from 481-488, it's once (484). So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but actually, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (each of 10 numbers) plus any extra in the incomplete decade. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing 1, so 48, and then in the incomplete decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, another 10 times. This pattern continues every 100 numbers. So how many hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So total tens place 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check: 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10\n101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10\n201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10\n301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10\n401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10\nSo that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50.\n\nWait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 more. So total tens place 4's: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check each component again.\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades (1-480) with 1 each, plus 1 in 481-488 (484). So 49.\n\nTens place: 10 per hundred, 5 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Wait, 401-488 is only part of the fifth hundred. But in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens 4's: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So 89.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with units place: For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's floor(488/10) = 48 times, but wait, 488 is included, so from 1-488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each contributing 1) plus the last partial set. Wait, 488 is the last number, which ends with 8, so in the units place, 8 appears once in each 10 numbers, and since 488 is exactly 48.8 sets, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48 times, plus the last number 488, which adds another 8 in the units place. Wait, no, because 488 is the 48th set's 8. Let me think again.\n\nActually, for units digit 8, from 1-488, it's 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, each contributing 1, and then in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 1-10: 8 once\n11-20: 8 once\n...\n481-490: 8 once at 488\nBut since we only go up to 488, that's the last occurrence. So total units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (from 481-488) = 49.\n\nNow, tens place for 8's: Similar to 4's, but we have to consider where the tens digit is 8. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 times\n101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 times\n201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 times\n301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 times\n401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 times (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 includes 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 480,481,...,488, but wait, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 401-488.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 4 full hundreds (1-400) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 in 401-488, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 4*10=40. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place 8's: 49, tens place 8's: 49, hundreds place 8's: 0. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** For every 10 consecutive numbers, '4' appears once in the units place. There are 48 full sets of 10 in 480, contributing 48 times. In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), '4' appears once (484). Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** For every 100 numbers, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488), contributing 10 each. Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, '4' appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1). Total: 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4's, '8' appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full sets, contributing 48 times. In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), '8' appears once (488). Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** For every 100 numbers, '8' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full sets (1-400), contributing 40 times. In 401-488, '8' appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '8' never appears in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

For every set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such sets are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear there. So total 4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, how about the tens digit? For every set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 1 to 488, how many such sets are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488). In each full set, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial set (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, that would be from 440-449. That's another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that adds another 10. So total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: Now, the hundreds digit. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: Units (48) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's are 187.\n\nNow, let me do the same for 8's:\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, that's 48 full sets (each contributing 1), plus the last 8 numbers (481-488). In those last 8 numbers, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: For the tens digit, every 100 numbers have 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). From 1 to 488, there are 4 full sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial set (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 times. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them except 488, which is the hundreds digit. Wait no, 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, ..., 488 is 4 8 8. So, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers from 480 to 488. So, that's 9 times.

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. For example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, each digit appears once. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for 48 blocks, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's.\n\nNow, looking at the extra 8 numbers from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, 48 + 1 = 49. So, for the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. That means the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in a block of 100. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., up to 9 (90-99). Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an incomplete block from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 blocks, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and the same for 8's, 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, looking at the incomplete block from 401-488. The tens digit here cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-490). However, since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for the numbers 441-450. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in this incomplete block.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times. The difference here is 50 - 48 = 2.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (since these are two-digit numbers). From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. Let's count how many numbers that is. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 in the hundreds place would be for numbers 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, the difference in the hundreds place is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 - 49 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 48 = 2\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting again with the units place: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, in 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units total 49 each, correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's. So, 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles. For 4's in the tens place, it's 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. For 8's, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 8's. So, total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 8 = 48. Difference of 2, correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. No 8's in hundreds place, so difference of 89.\n\nAdding them up: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Correct.\n\nAnd for 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no page 800-899, so zero 8's there. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, when I was calculating the 8's, I considered 481-488 as 8 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 481 + 1 = 8. So, 8 8's in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, each of those 8 numbers has an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 8 8's in the tens place. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the 401-488 range, the 4's in the tens place are from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nWait, hold on, no. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing the total counts. Wait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake here. Because when I calculated the units, tens, and hundreds separately, I should sum each digit's count across all places, then subtract. But in my earlier calculation, I was summing the differences per place and then adding those differences. Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the total number of 4's and total number of 8's separately, then subtract.\n\nLet me try that approach to cross-verify.\n\nCalculating total number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the difference is 91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any digits. Each page number is considered digit by digit, so units, tens, hundreds are separate, so adding them is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the last 8 numbers, 8 appears once (at 488). So, 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- How many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times. So, total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nIn each full hundred, 10 times. So, 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, 8 times. So, total 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nSince the book ends at 488, there are no pages 800-899, so 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - 48 occurrences of '4' and '8' each.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Complete blocks of 100: 4, contributing 40 '4's and 40 '8's each.\n   - In 401-488:\n     - '4' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (441-450).\n     - '8' appears in the tens place for 8 numbers (481-488).\n   - Total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers 400-488: 89 times.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total '8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (total '4's) - 97 (total '8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:** There are 91 more '4's printed than '8's.  \n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll need to check each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for 8's. \n\nStarting with the 4's:\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4,14,24,... So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups. That means 48 times 4 appears in the units place. But wait, the last group is from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, so does that mean the 48th group ends at 480? Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Let me consider that from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 is in the units digit. So, starting from 4, every 10 numbers. So, how many such numbers are there? The first one is 4, then 14, 24,... up to 484, which is 484. So, how many terms are there? Let's see, from 4 to 484 with a common difference of 10. The formula for the nth term is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1, so n=49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range, but 494 would be beyond 488, so actually, the last occurrence is 484. So, n=49, meaning 49 times. But let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Yes, that seems right.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens digit. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Let's see, the first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers, then 140-149, which is another 10, and so on. The last block would be 440-449, but wait, our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 450-459 would be next, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 as well. Let me count how many blocks:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nSo that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then each subsequent block is 100 apart. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Wait, no, 400-499 would have 4 in the hundreds place, but our book ends at 488, so it's 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. But since we're only concerned with the digit 4 in the hundreds place, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers in the units place. So, starting from 8,18,28,... up to 488. Let's see how many times 8 appears in the units place.\n\nUsing the same approach as with 4's. The last number with 8 in the units place before 488 is 488 itself, which is 488. So, how many terms are there? Starting at 8, with a common difference of 10, up to 488.\n\nUsing the formula: a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488.\n\nSo, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488\n\nSubtract 8: 10(n-1) = 480\n\nDivide by 10: n-1 = 48\n\nSo, n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. So, 49 times.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, the digit 8 in the tens place. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers instead of 10.\n\nSo, let's count the blocks:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total occurrences in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Each block from 80-89, etc., up to 480-488. So, 5 blocks in total, but the last one has only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, 4 full blocks of 10, and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place. Wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3, or 4. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I had 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. The blocks are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, the blocks are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for both 4 and 8: 49 each, which seems correct because from 1 to 488, each digit appears 49 times in the units place. Wait, is that accurate? Let me think. For units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each block of 10, except possibly the last block. But in our case, 488 is the last page, which is 488, so for units digit, 8 appears in 488, so the count is 49. Similarly, 4 appears in 484, so 49 times. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units digit count again. For 4's, the last occurrence is 484, which is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so 48*10 +4=484. So, the number of 4's in units place is 49, as we have 484 as the 49th term. Similarly, for 8's, the last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th term in the sequence starting at 8 with step 10. So, 8,18,...,488, which is 49 terms. So, correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 4's: from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488, so no page numbers from 800-899. So, 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49+0=98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. The last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 total. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.
