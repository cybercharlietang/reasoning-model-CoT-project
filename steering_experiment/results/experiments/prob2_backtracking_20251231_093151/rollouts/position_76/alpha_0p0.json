    "text": " So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's correct. And for the tens place of 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, no. 480 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, that's correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
