    "text": " Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let's compute (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, in the tens place, we have 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. Wait, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many times this happens. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many full sets of 10 are there? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49 eights. Wait, let me make sure. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me check again. Units place: 8,18,...,488: that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. Yep, that's correct. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Yes, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. So, each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Let me count how many such blocks there are.

So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my counts again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for eights, in the tens place, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 in total for tens. Units place: 49, correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but let me think again: when counting the tens place for fours, I had 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and that's within 488, so that's fine. Similarly, for eights, the tens place goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, making the total tens eights 49. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49.

    "text": " Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, no: 8,18,...,488. Let me see: 488 / 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers (since 488 is the 49th number after 0). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many full blocks there are: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480 to 489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 in 480-488. So that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90. That seems correct. I think I did everything right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, with 5 blocks in total, giving 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This is 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive), contributing 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, but does 480-489 include 488? Yes, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens place 8's are 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10*4 +9=49. So, tens place:49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98.

When I count 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems right. Similarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place for 4's: up to 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 fours. Tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours.

Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers where 8 is in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see, up to 488, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets of 10, so 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now it's 49. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. Each hundred block has one set of 10 where the tens digit is 8. So, from 0-99:80-89 (10), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488 (9). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. So, I was wrong earlier; it's 49, not 40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Wait, but let me make sure. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many is that? The last one is 488, which is the 49th number because 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: as above, 49. So, 49+49=98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me list them: 8,18,28,...,488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, no, 80-89 is in 1-100, 180-189 in 101-200, 280-289 in 201-300, 380-389 in 301-400, and 480-488 in 401-500. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is correct. So, 4 sets of 10 (each contributing 10 eights) and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go back to the number of 4's in the units place. I initially thought it was 49, but let me recount. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 4, then 14, 24,..., up to 484. So, how many terms are there? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n -6, where n=1 gives 4. So, 10n -6 =484. Solving for n: 10n=490, so n=49. So, 49 times. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct.\n\nNow, for the 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488. So, same as 4's, 49 times.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: none, as before.\n\nSo, total eights: 49+49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position again, just to be thorough.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 188\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For each digit position, calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits digit:\n\n- For 4's: floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10)=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49.\n- For 8's: same as 4's, 49.\n\nTens digit:\n\n- For 4's: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so for 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-400) plus 88 pages (401-488). In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, 10 numbers have tens digit 4. So, 4 hundreds: 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8 (since 488 is 4-8-8). So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., 8 (481-490). But we only go up to 488, so tens digit 8 is present from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's: 4*10 +10=50. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. So, 4 hundreds: 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens digit 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\n- For 4's: Only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n- For 8's: No numbers, since 800-899 are beyond 488.\n\nSo, same counts as before. Thus, the difference is indeed 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let's see, 488 is the last page. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included. So, starting from 8, 18, ..., 488. Let's see: 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, no, actually, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, the number of times is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is 8. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, it is included. So, floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 is 49.

Let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers here. So total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

How many such numbers? The last number is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 8 appears in the units place at 8,18,...,488. Let me count how many: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10.

Hmm, but wait, in the tens place for eights, I counted 49. Let me check that again. The tens place for eights: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Units place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see: 484 is the last one. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place: 80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488 \u2192 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, then every 10 after that. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. So, (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last block. Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

How many such numbers? The last one is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, which would give 48 eights, but since 488 is included, that's actually 49 eights. Wait, let me think again. The first 8 is at 8, then 18, ..., up to 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49.

Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Yep, that's correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.

The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 8 appears in 8,18,...,488, which is 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, each set from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 is 10 numbers each, so 4 sets, which is 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, did I count the hundreds place correctly for fours? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. For the tens place, I had 5 sets of 10 for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 4 full sets (80-89, etc.) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Units place for both digits: 49 each, which seems right because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 times each digit from 0-9 appears in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last number, so for 8 in units place, it's 488, which is included, so yes, 49 times. Similarly for 4, the last occurrence is 484, which is included, so 49 times. So, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 380-389 is okay, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49+40=89. So, total eights are 89. Wait, let me double-check. Units:49, tens:40, hundreds:0. 49+40=89. Yep. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 89 (eights) = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the units place for fours again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 484/10=48.4, but since we start at 4, which is the 1st, then 14 is the 2nd, so 484 is the 49th. So, 49 fours in units place. That seems right. For tens place, fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488 is the last one, so (488-8)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. Each is 10, so 4 sets, 40 eights. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Therefore, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10, totaling 40 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 89\n   - Difference: 188 - 89 = 99\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 99.\n\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, I can take 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that would be 49 numbers. Because 8,18,28,...,488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 5 blocks, but the last block has only 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks with 10 each, and 1 block with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4 full blocks and one partial. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just quickly check if I made any mistakes. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 49, which included 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 480 is the first, 488 is the last, that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, it's 49. So, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds. So, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check again for units place in fours. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly, for units place in eights: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. So, yes, 49 each. So, the counts seem accurate.

    "text": " Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's actually 49 numbers. Because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count each block. Each block from 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Yep. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For the fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should check if I counted correctly in each place. For fours in units: from 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each 100 block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, but for the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. Correct. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,...,480-488. Each 100 block has 10, except the last one which has 9. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, fours:188, eights:98. Difference:90. Therefore, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. For fours: units place, I had 49. Tens place, 50. Hundreds place, 89. Total 188. For eights: units place, 49. Tens place, 49. Hundreds place, 0. Total 98. Difference is 90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, when counting the tens place for eights, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 49. So, yes, that's correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, we had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four sets have 10 each, and the last set (480-488) has 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no pages 800-899.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
