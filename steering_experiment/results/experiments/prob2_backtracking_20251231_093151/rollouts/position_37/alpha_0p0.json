    "text": " Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many sets of 10 there are. Each set (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 instead of 10. So, how many complete sets? Let's see, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 complete sets (each 10) and one partial set of 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me make sure. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place:49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place for fours and eights. For fours in the tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five sets, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours. That's correct. For eights in the tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's five sets, but the last one only has 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place: fours go up to 484, which is 49 numbers (since 484/10=48.4, so 49). Eights go up to 488, which is also 49 numbers (488/10=48.8, so 49). So, units place counts are correct. Hundreds place: fours from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Eights in hundreds place: none, since 800>488. So, yes, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\)\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\)\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each complete range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 4 such ranges.  \n   - The last range (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8 (since the book ends at 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\)\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\)\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Let me count how many sets there are. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? Starting from 8, every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think. The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, how many terms are there? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. We want the last term to be <=488. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 <=488. Let's solve for n: (n-1)*10 <=480 => n-1 <=48 => n <=49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of that. Wait, so how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10, but the last set is only 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49? Wait, no, let me check again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10=40, plus 9, total 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that's 98 eights. But wait, earlier I thought units place had 49 eights, tens had 49, so total 98. Now, let me check if that's correct. Units: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But let me think again about the tens place for eights. I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. And for fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. So, yes, I think 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let me count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position similarly: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is included. Let me list them: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8 (which is 8*1), the next is 18 (8*2), ..., up to 488 (8*61). Wait, because 8*61=488. So, that's 61 numbers. Wait, no, because 8*1=8, 8*2=16, but that's not right. Wait, no, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0-9, so the 8's in units place occur every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The number of times is the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. But wait, the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the first occurrence in the units place of the first decade (1-10), then 18, 28,...,488. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, but let me think: from 1-10, 8 is once. 11-20: 18 once. So, up to 480, that's 480/10=48 times. Then, 481-490 would have 488, which is within 488, so that's the 49th. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. Counting 4's: Units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. The last one is 488, which is 8*61=488. So, from 8*1 to 8*61, that's 61 numbers? Wait, no, because 8*1=8, 8*2=16, but that's not the right way. It's every 10 numbers, so 8 occurs once every 10 numbers. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then the 49th in the 49th decade (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, that's 488, so 49 times. So, units place:49. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought 488 is 8*61, but that's not the right approach because the units digit cycles every 10. So, yes, units digit 8 occurs 49 times, tens digit 8 occurs 49 times, and hundreds digit 0 times. So, total 98 eights. Therefore, 4's are 188, 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 8th digit in the units place. Wait, no, 488 is the 488th page, so the units digit cycles every 10. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, but since 488 ends with 8, we add 1 more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers). So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place eights: 10 +10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because I thought the hundreds place would have zero, but let me check again. Wait, in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. Units place: 49, tens:49, so total eights:98. Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10*4 +9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check the counts again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me recount the fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. And for the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers, making the tens place count 50. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, plus the last partial ten which includes 484, so 49 in total. That seems right. For the eights, units place:488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, plus the last one which is 488, so 49. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. So, units:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many numbers in each set. Each full hundred (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8 in the page numbers. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

The last one is 488, so from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

And hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units for fours: from 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th number because (484-4)/10 +1=48.4, but since we include both ends, it's 49. Similarly, units for eights: up to 488, which is the 49th occurrence.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, total of 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that seems correct. Let me check again: units place:49, tens place:49, so 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Yes, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each of these blocks (except maybe the last one) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place.

Let me count how many full blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40.

Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10, and the last set has 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488. How many such numbers? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488). Let me count each set: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Yep, that's correct. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, did I do that right? Let me just go through the counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9.

So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, let me check again. Units: 49, tens:49, so 98 eights. Now, subtracting the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For the units place, both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences. But wait, when I counted units for 4, I included up to 484, which is correct because 484 is the last number with a 4 in the units place before 488. Similarly, for 8, up to 488, so 488 is included, making it 49. For the tens place, 4's had 50, which is 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 fours. For 8's, it's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, etc.) and one set of 9 (480-488), totaling 49. So, 50 vs 49. Then, hundreds place: 89 fours vs 0 eights. So, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188 fours, and 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. 188 - 98 = 90.

Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488. So, how many such numbers are there? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let me calculate how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but does 480-489 also have tens digit 8? Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have?

Wait, 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers, yes. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) have 10 numbers each, so 4 sets \u00d710=40. Then, the last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers.

How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 eights in the tens place here. So total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

Let me see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, it's 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so actually, it's 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one.

Let's see how many that is. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the first in 1-10, then 18 in 11-20, etc. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Well, 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 minus 2, but wait, 488 is 8 in the units place. So, starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds one more 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Wait, is that right? Wait, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, that's 4 blocks of 10 (40) plus 9, so 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place, same as fours, 49 eights. So, 98 eights total. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made an error. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in each position. Units: every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 includes another 8, that's 49 times. Wait, but for fours, in the units place, it's 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers is that? From 0 to 484, stepping by 10: 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. So, 49 fours in units. Similarly, in the tens place, 40-49,140-149, etc. Each block of 100 has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 blocks (1-400) would give 40, but wait, 400-488 is another block where the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, eights total 49+49=98. Thus, 188-98=90. I think that's correct.

    "text": " Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many? Let's see, the last number is 488, which is the 8th occurrence in the units place for the 480-488 range. Wait, no. Wait, 488 is 488, so 8 in units place occurs at 8,18,...,488. Let me calculate how many. The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of 8's in units place is floor(488/10) +1 if 488 mod 10 is 8 or more. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But since 488 ends with 8, we add 1, so 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's see how many full sets we have. Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Hmm, but I thought maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights in the tens place for that last set. So, 4 full sets (80-89, etc.) give 4*10=40, plus 9, so 49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with an additional 9 in 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, so 0 times.\n- Total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the last page is 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have tens digit 8? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, how many sets? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, for the tens place, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) each have 10 eights, but the last set (480-488) has 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, let me confirm: units:49, tens:49, so total 98 eights. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The question is asking how many more fours than eights are printed. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four blocks give 10 each, and the last block gives 9. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers.

So, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. And the units place: from 8,18,...488: (488-8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units:49, tens:49, total eights:98.
