    "text": " Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, so how many are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block, which only goes up to 488. So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. That's 5 blocks of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total numbers: 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total numbers: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 numbers.  \n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.  \n   - Total occurrences: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should recount the units place. From 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many numbers is that? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So that's correct. Now, moving on to counting the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, since the book has 488 pages. So, how many such numbers? Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, we have to check if 480-488 is included. So, from 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, let me count: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80s,180s,280s,380s) =40, plus 9 in the 480s, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. So, counting how many times 8 appears in each place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. So, 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many sets. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but does 488 count as the 49th? Let's see: 8,18,...,488. So, starting from 8, each step is +10. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. Let me find n when the term is 488. 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488 => (n-1)*10 = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. Yes, that's 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. Hmm, but wait, in the units place, we had 49 eights, and in the tens place, 49, so total 98. So, now, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the number of fours. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. So, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units:49 fours. Tens place:40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place:400-488: how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: units place:8,18,...,488. Let's use the same formula: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units:49 eights. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but does 488 count? Yes, because the units digit is 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, actually, from 480-489, but since the book stops at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, for the tens place, we have four blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.

But wait, let me check units place again. Units place: from 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The common difference is 10. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. Tens place: as above, 49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and eights were 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because 90 seems high. Let me recount the fours and eights.\n\nWait, when I counted the fours, I had 49 in units, 50 in tens, and 89 in hundreds, totaling 188. For eights, 49 in units, 49 in tens, and 0 in hundreds, totaling 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct, but let me see if I made a mistake in any of the counts.\n\nWait, for the hundreds place in fours, I counted from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Let me confirm: 488 - 400 +1 =89. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets of 10: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. As I calculated earlier, that's 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nTotal fours:188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that in the hundreds place, for fours, it's 89, but for eights, it's 0. So, the fours have a significant advantage there. Let me see: 89 fours in hundreds place, while eights have none. So, that's 89 more fours right there. Then, in the tens place, fours have 50, eights have 49. So, that's 1 more four. In the units place, both have 49, so no difference there. So, total difference would be 89+1=90. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the fours are printed 90 more times than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). This results in 49 occurrences (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). This results in 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). Total = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position as well: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. So, how many sets? Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits that are 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers (including both 480 and 488). So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that last set. So, total eights: 4*10 +9=49. So, that seems right. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90.

The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers: 14,24,...,484. So, the number of 4's in the units place is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. Let's compute that: (488 - 4) = 484, 484/10 = 48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So that's correct. Now, moving on to counting the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Let me see: 488 is the last page, so yes. So, how many 8's in the units place? Starting at 8, then 18, 28,...,488. So, the last number is 488, which is 488 = 8 + 10*(n-1), so 488 = 8 + 10n -10 => 488 = 10n -2 => 10n = 490 => n=49.

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, let's see how many complete sets there are. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, let me confirm that. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting fours and eights. For fours: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89). 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units (49), tens (49). 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for fours, I considered 440-449 as 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which I accounted for. So, yes, 98 eights in total. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers? Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, the tens place has 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. Hmm, that seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counts. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10, with the last block (480-488) contributing 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me count again: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let's calculate how many terms that is. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place in fours, it's 50, which is 10 per hundred block, and there are 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 5*10=50. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so up to 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. That seems correct. For eights: units place, same as fours, 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That adds up correctly. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90.

So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first is 8, then 18, up to 488. So, the last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, 188-98 is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference: 90. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, counting the number of 8's in each place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, so how many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's the 48th group plus one more. Wait, no, actually, 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.

Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct.

Wait, but 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is included). So, let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, that's 49? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yep, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens digit for the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, resulting in 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens digit for the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The last range contributes 9 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. How many are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have the tens digit as 8? Yes, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the tens place. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens:49, so 98 total. Fours:188. 188-98=90.
