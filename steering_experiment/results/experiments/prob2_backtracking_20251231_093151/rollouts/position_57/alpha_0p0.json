Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488 - 400 +1 =89. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five sets of 10, so 50 fours. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...484. From 4 to 484, that's (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, that's correct. For eights: units place is 8,18,...488. So, 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct. Maybe I was just doubting myself too much, but I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences except the last, which has 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
