    "text": " So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total. Now, let me check that again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. Wait, units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, which gives 48 occurrences, but then we have an extra 4 at 484, which is the 49th. So yes, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: as before, 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many times? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). Then, from 400-488, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book stops at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, the number of 8's is 4 blocks of 10 (40) plus 9 in the 480-488 range. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check that again. From 1-400, each 100 has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 blocks (1-400) gives 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights. So total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 49 is 98, but let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. Hundreds place: 0. So total eights: 98. Now, fours were 188, eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included. So, 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, meaning 48 times, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is the 49th. Wait, but 488 is the 49th? Let me check: 8 is the first, 18 second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let me count each block. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: since 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus the 480-488 which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: from 1-100, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (40-49). Then 101-200, same thing: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. But wait, I think I made a mistake here because in the units place, when I counted up to 484, that's 49 numbers, but from 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10. Let me check again: the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of times the units digit is 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have units digit 4? Well, every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So that's correct. Now, tens place: each hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. There are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 isn't a full hundred, so I need to check if the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-488. From 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, so 400-409: tens digit 0, 410-419: tens digit 1, ..., 440-449: tens digit 4, 450-459: 5, etc. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in each hundred block, except maybe the last one, there are 10 numbers with tens digit 4. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred block, right? So, total hundreds blocks would be 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each of the first four blocks, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. In the fifth block, 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's: 5 blocks \u00d710 =50, which matches my earlier count. So, tens place:50 fours. Hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so hundreds digit 4 occurs 89 times. So, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Wait, but let me check: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, that seems high, but let's go with it for now. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the hundreds block. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 1-488, how many such blocks? Let's see: 0-99:80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times. So, total tens digit 8's: 4 blocks with 10 each (from 0-399) plus 9 in 400-488. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, tens place:49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Wait, so total fours are 188, and total eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the fours and eights to ensure I didn't overcount or undercount. **Recounting Fours:**\n- Units place:4,14,24,...,484. As before, that's 49 numbers.\n- Tens place:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of the first four blocks gives 10 fours, and the fifth block (400-488) gives 10 fours because 440-449 is within 488. So, 5\u00d710=50.\n- Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\n**Recounting Eights:**\n- Units place:8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers.\n- Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four blocks give 10 each, and the last block gives 9 because 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n- Hundreds place:0, as before.\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many that is. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is valid. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) and then 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total eights from total fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers.

That's indeed 5 sets, so 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. Total 188. For 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. That seems correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Units place: 49 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, so 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Yeah, that seems right.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488.

Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. So, starting from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would have 10 eights, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.

From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let me calculate how many terms there are. The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488.

From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each contribute 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9 = 40 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488.

So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8.

Wait, but in the tens place, the digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers. So, the tens place contributes 10 (from 80-89) +10 (180-189)+10 (280-289)+10 (380-389)+9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers, correct. So, total tens place eights: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 times (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 only when the number is between 400 and 499. Since our book goes up to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 eights, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. Total: 188. For eights: units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. Total: 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, I think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 4, 14, 24, ..., 484, there are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear since the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure. From 40-49: yes, 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, so 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but I'm supposed to count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place, which is once per number, so 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 8 appears in the units place at 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489: but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 480-489 block, only 9 numbers are present. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, earlier when counting the number of 4's in the units place, I thought it was 49, but let me confirm. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, correct, 49.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (40s,140s,240s,340s,440s). So, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. As before, 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nThus, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again if I counted correctly for the hundreds place of 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnother way: Let's think about how many numbers have 4 in each digit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula for digit counting.\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated based on higher digits, current digit, and lower digits.\n\nBut since the book is only 488 pages, which is less than 500, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I think I did it correctly by breaking it down into units, tens, hundreds. So, perhaps the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for 4's? Let me list them:\n\n40-49: 10 numbers, each has 4 in tens place.\n\n140-149: 10\n\n240-249:10\n\n340-349:10\n\n440-449:10\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, 10 each: 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\n80-89:10\n\n180-189:10\n\n280-289:10\n\n380-389:10\n\n480-488:9\n\nSo, 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:90.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using digit positions and calculating for each place.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor((488)/10)=48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, we add 1, so 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod10=8, which is exactly 8, so 49.\n\nWait, but in the units place, the number of 4's is 49, and 8's is 49. So, same in units place.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4 (since 488/100=4.88), so 4 full hundreds. Then, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, 10 numbers have 4 in tens place. So, 4*10=40. But wait, we have 488, which is in the 400-488 range. So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the 400-488 range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond 449, so 440-449 is fully included. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 5 times in the hundreds (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). So, 5*10=50. Wait, but using the formula, floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40, but we have an extra 10 in the last partial hundred (400-488). So, total 50. So, 50 fours in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. But in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:50, 8's:49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\n4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours.\n\n8's: since 800-899 is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49(units)+49(tens)+0(hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last block, which has 9 numbers.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks of 10 numbers each, giving 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but wait, 48\u00d710=480, so 480 +8=488, which is the last one. So, how many 8's in units place? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many blocks. Each block is 100 numbers, so 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=49 eights. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, total fours (188) minus total eights (98) equals 188-98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours first. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. So, 484 is the 49th number because (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, the answer should be 90. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 eights each, and the last block contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 times.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98 eights**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 fours - 98 eights = **90 more 4's than 8's**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So, 5 times 10 is 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. Let's count how many full sets we have. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each of the first four sets contributes 10, and the last set contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 end at 449, which is within 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, so how many are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Yes, because 488 is the 49th occurrence (8, 18, ..., 488). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. So, each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many numbers in each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, each of the next three blocks is 10, and the last block is 9, so 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: Units place: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. When counting 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, 10 (from 80-89) +10 (180-189) +10 (280-289) +10 (380-389) +9 (480-488) = 49. That seems correct. For fours in the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That's correct. Wait, but 488-400+1=89. Yes, that's correct. So, total fours:188, eights:98, difference:90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). This results in 49 occurrences (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences. Thus, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). This results in 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The first four blocks each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9. Thus, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure. The first block is 40-49: 10 numbers, that's correct. Then each subsequent hundred adds another 10. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but wait, 400-488: the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*49=488? Wait, no, 8 occurs once every 10 numbers, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is within 488, so that's correct. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489: but since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, let me check the last set. 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me clarify: the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, the number of numbers is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8 to 488, stepping by 10: 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 488/10=48.8, so the number of terms is 49 (since starting at 8, which is the first term). So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because I thought 188-98=90, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify each count again. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets, so 50 fours in the tens place. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place is 49, tens place is 49, hundreds place is 0. So, 98 eights. 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, I might have miscounted. Let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Similarly, for the tens place, each 100 block has 10 fours in the tens place, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 5 sets of 10, 50 fours in the tens place. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see: 484 is the last one. 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full decades, but since we start at 4, which is the first occurrence, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 fours in the units place. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 98 eights. Thus, 188-98=90.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences (since 488 is included). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book's pages. Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, in the tens place, how many times does 8 appear? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, no eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484) \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488) \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in 1-488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 count as 10 numbers? Yes, because 440 is included and 449 is within 488. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, let me check that again. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Hmm, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484: 484 is 484, so from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 40-49, 140-149, etc. From 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 400-488 is part of the hundreds place, so that's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But wait, when considering the tens place, each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 fours in the tens place. So, up to 400, how many hundreds are there? 400 is the start of the hundreds place for 4. So, let's see: 40-49: 10 fours, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. So, that's correct. Now, hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many there are. The last number is 488, so how many terms? (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except possibly the last one. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, that seems correct. Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, total fours are 188, and total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's.

    "text": " So, that's 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours. Wait, but does 440-449 actually count? Since 488 is higher than 449, yes, it does. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49.

Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. Let's count how many blocks. Each block is 100 numbers, so 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 4 blocks with 10 eights each, and 1 block with 9 eights. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me verify: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 49 numbers (including 488). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 would be part of that. So, let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). Wait, let me count: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, how many sets are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems high. Let me go through each part again. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484: that's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. So 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So total eights:49+49=98. So 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the hundreds place for fours, I counted 89, but when I think about it, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. And for eights, in the hundreds place, there are none. So, yes, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 sets \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 40-49: yes, 10. Then 140-149: another 10, that's 20. 240-249: 30, 340-349:40, 440-449:50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, but wait, 48*10=480, so 480 is the last multiple of 10 before 488. So, 480 is included, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is 484-4=480, so 48 times, but wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4 as the first. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. From 1-488, how many hundreds? 4 hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. Wait, actually, 401-488 is part of the 400s. So, in each hundred, except maybe the last one, there are 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So, 1-100: 40-49: 10 numbers. 101-200: 140-149:10. 201-300:240-249:10. 301-400:340-349:10. Now, 401-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count how many sets. 80-89:10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's a big difference. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Number of 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Number of 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 starting from page 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we have to check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 count as 10? Yes, because 440 is the first and 449 is the last, so 10 numbers. So, 5 sets \u00d710=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.

So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds places with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Total occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9.  \n   - Total occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\[\n188 \\, (\\text{number of 4's}) - 98 \\, (\\text{number of 8's}) = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400 is the first number with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. So, there are 49 occurrences (since 488 is included). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, let me recount: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure. For each hundred block, 80-89 is 10, same for 180-189, etc. So, up to 480-489, which is 10 numbers, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have 9 numbers in that last partial block. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Partial block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total blocks: 4 full blocks + 1 partial block = 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 5 sets \u00d710=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, let me confirm: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same way. Let me go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's are there in the units place? Let's see: The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Let's calculate (488 - 8)/10 +1. That's (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 from 480-488. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times this happens. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let's calculate 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is 488, so units digit is 8, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, for the units place of 4's, I got 49. Let me recount that. From 4, 14, 24,...,484. So, how many terms? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term can be represented as 10n - 6, but maybe a better way is to see how many numbers are there. The first number is 4, which is 4 + 10*(0) = 4, and the last is 484, which is 4 + 10*(48) = 484. So, n = 48 + 1 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., each set has 10 numbers. There are 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5*10=50, which is correct.\n\nFor hundreds place of 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 400 +1 =89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188, correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449, which is 5 sets. So 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, but 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. For units place, 484 is the last number with 4 in the units place, so from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So 484 / 10 = 48.4, so 49 times. That seems correct. For tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, and there are 5 hundreds (0-400, 100-200, etc.), so 5 x 10 = 50. That seems correct. For hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours are 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since 489 is beyond 488, we only go up to 488. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? Each hundred block (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 480-488 inclusive, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four sets are 10 each, and the last set is 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 488 - 400 +1 =89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place:8,18,...,488. The last term is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

That's 5 sets, so 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many times? The first is 8, then every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Let me count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189:10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

It's 488//10 +1 if 488 mod 10 is 8. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, yes, so it's 48 +1=49.

Wait, but 480-489 would be next, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let me count each block. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: how many? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90.

So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).

Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 -480 +1 =9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights =90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98.

So, the tens place in the hundreds: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers). Total: 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. 100-199:140-149 is another 10. 200-299:240-249 is 10. 300-399:340-349 is 10. 400-488:440-449 is 10, because 440-449 is within 488. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. Let's count each block. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199:180-189 is 10. 200-299:280-289 is 10. 300-399:380-389 is 10. 400-488:480-488. Now, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) and then 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10=40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. So, starting at 4, every 10 numbers. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place: 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (1-500, but wait, the book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. So, tens place: 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur at 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, using the same formula: ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block, which only goes up to 488. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's:188, number of 8's:98. So, 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place of fours, it's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place:49. So, 188 fours. For eights, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 90, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.
