    "text": " Let me count how many hundreds there are. From 0-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 40 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, 89 + 89 = 178. So, total fours are 178. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets are there? Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 178 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 80. So, there are 80 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let's see how many hundreds we have. The book goes up to 488, so we have 4 hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So that's 4 times 10, which is 40. But wait, in the last hundred, 401-488, does 440-449 fall within that? Yes, because 440 is less than 488. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 5 times 10, which is 50. Wait, no, because from 1-400, we have 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 40. Then, from 401-488, we have another 10 in 440-449. So, total is 50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 9, not 10. So, let's calculate: for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each has 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, in 480-488, it's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me calculate how many hundreds blocks there are. From 1-400, there are four blocks of 100. So, each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 blocks * 10 = 40 fours. But wait, the last block is 400-499, but our book only goes up to 488, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, the total in the tens place is 10 (40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 fours. Wait, but earlier I thought it was four blocks, each contributing 10, which would be 40, but now I'm getting 50. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. From 1-100: 40-49 is 10 fours in the tens place. Then 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, another 10. 301-400: 340-349, another 10. 401-488: 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So units place is correct at 49. Tens place: as above, 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought each block contributes 10, but the last block only has 9 because the book ends at 488. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are four blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 4*10=40 fours. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, because from 1-400, we have four blocks each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, 400-488: the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place fours would be 40 +10=50. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? So 440-449 is within that. So yes, 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm. From 1-400, the tens digit 4 occurs 4 times 10, which is 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total is 50. So, tens place gives us 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Wait, let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So units:49. Tens place: as above, 50. Hundreds place: 89. So total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many numbers. The first is 8, last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Let's count how many blocks: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So hundreds place eights:0. So total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I thought from 1-400, there are four blocks of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 40. Then, 400-488: the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, total 50. That seems right. Similarly, for eights in the tens place: from 80-89, 180-189, etc., each block has 10 eights, so four blocks would be 40, but wait, wait: 80-89 is one block, 180-189 another, 280-289, 380-389, and then 480-488. So that's five blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10, which is 40, plus 9 from the last partial block, totaling 49. So that's correct. So, yes, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 blocks (including 440-449).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 0 \\).\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:** \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, total eights in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, but let me make sure. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10\u00d74=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again because I think I might have made a mistake. Let me go through the fours again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks \u00d710=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 5 blocks. So, 50 fours in tens. Hundreds place: 400-488. How many? 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in hundreds. Total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, that seems correct, but I thought maybe I was wrong earlier, but no, it's 90. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, total 98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me count how many hundreds there are. The page numbers go up to 488, so the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in each hundred block. So, from 0-488, how many hundreds? 0-99: 100 numbers, 100-199: another 100, 200-299: another 100, 300-399: another 100, and 400-488: 89 numbers. Wait, but when considering the tens place, each hundred block from 0-99, 100-199, etc., up to 400-488, each has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds blocks have a 4 in the tens place? Let's see: 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 100-199: 140-149 is 10, 200-299: 240-249 is 10, 300-399: 340-349 is 10, and 400-488: 440-449 is 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times this happens. The first 8 is at 8, and the last one in the units place is at 488. So, how many numbers? If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 100-199: 180-189 is 10, 200-299: 280-289 is 10, 300-399: 380-389 is 10, and 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) = 98 eights. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me count the number of hundreds. From 1-400, there are four blocks of 100, so 4 times 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place fours would be 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Wait, no, because from 1-400, it's four sets, but 440-449 is the fifth set. Wait, no, because 400-499 would be another set, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 440-449, which is within 488. So, how many sets are there? Let's see: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Let's see: 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each full set (e.g., 80-89) has 10 eights in the tens place. How many full sets are there? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. Then 100-199: 140-149. 200-299:240-249. 300-399:340-349. 400-488:440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, total 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, the last 8 in the units place is at 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. Starting from 8, each 10 numbers add another 8 in the units place. So, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears in the ones place from 1 to 488. To find this, we can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8. But wait, the 48th decade would end at 480, and then 488 is in the next decade. So, from 1-480, there are 48 8's in the units place, and then 488 adds another one, making it 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Let me check: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. Yes, that's 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, and total eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's the calculation. But let me think again about the tens place for fours. I had 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours. Wait, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50. That's correct. And for the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the eights, units place: up to 488, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks gives 10 eights, and the last block gives 9 eights, totaling 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for fours was 89, but maybe I made a mistake there. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. That seems correct. So, the total fours are 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98. So, difference is 90. Yeah, I think that's correct.

The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 occurrences, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. Numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers, and each contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 0-99: 80-89:10 numbers, 100-199:180-189:10, 200-299:280-289:10, 300-399:380-389:10. Now, 400-488: does 480-489 exist? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, which would be 10 numbers, but since we only have up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, for the hundreds block 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10, so 4*10=40, plus the 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 8, which is 10 numbers. So, up to 399, we have 4 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Total blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449)  \n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488.  \n   - Total numbers: 89  \n   - Total occurrences: 89\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last block, which contributes 9.  \n   - Total blocks: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 1 partial block (480-488).  \n   - Total occurrences: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me calculate how many hundreds there are. From 1-400, there are four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each has a 40-49 block, so that's 4 blocks \u00d710=40 fours in the tens place. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So that's 40 +10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, no. Wait, from 1-400, each hundred has a 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 4 hundreds \u00d710=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So total is 40 +10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. From 1-400, that's 4\u00d710=40. Then from 400-488, 440-449 is another 10, so 50 total. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Now, how many such blocks are there in 1-488? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, so 4\u00d710=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but from 400-488, is there another 8 in the tens place? 480-489 would be the next, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's another 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, but from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710=40 (from 80-89, etc.) plus 9=49. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. From 1-400, we have 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, which is 4 blocks of 10, so 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place eights:0. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 exist? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

But wait, 440-449 is another block, so that's 5 blocks. So 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, the book goes up to 488, so does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Each number from 400-488 has 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400 is included, so yes, 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, how many such numbers? The last number is 488, so 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many blocks. Each block is 10 numbers. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. I said that in the tens place, 4 appears in 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct because 440-449 is within 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Similarly, for eights, in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks each have 10 eights, contributing 40, and the last block has 9 eights, so 49 in total. That seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is the last page, that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8,18,...,488: that's 49 numbers, right?

So, adding up: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488.

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks of 10 numbers each. So, 5 times 10 is 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? Let's divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but let's check if 488 is included. The first 8 is at 8, then every 10 numbers. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 8 + 10*(48-1) = 8 + 470 = 478, and then 488 is the next one. Wait, that might not be the right way. Alternatively, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears from 1 to 488. So, 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. Wait, no: 488 is the 49th term because starting from 8, which is the 1st, then 18 is 2nd, etc., up to 488 being the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so the last block is 380-389, and then 480-489. But 488 is within 480-489, so we have 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98=90. But let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the fours first. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488. That's 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. Same formula: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188 fours. Eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but maybe I should check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers:480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 numbers, correct. So, yes, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:98. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 40 occurrences, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many hundreds do we have? From 0-400, that's 4 hundreds, right? So, 4 sets of 10 numbers each, so 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 count as a full set? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 40 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, let me add up the fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+40=89, plus 89 is 178. Hmm, that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,...,488. The difference between each term is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Wait, but wait, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, and similarly for each hundred. So, from 0-400, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Units: 49, Tens:49, so total 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 178, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 178 - 98 = 80.

    "text": " So, each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many hundred blocks do we have? From 1-400, there are four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, because 440-449 is part of the 401-500 block, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488. So, each hundred block up to 400 contributes 10, and then 440-449 is another 10. So, 4 blocks \u00d710 =40, plus 10 more, so 50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place?

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of such numbers is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 484 is included, it's 49. So, units place: 49. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, and there are 4 full hundred blocks (1-400), so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total tens place: 40 +10=50. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 +50 +89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The count is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are four hundred blocks, each contributing 10: 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights:40 +9=49. Wait, is that correct? Let me think: From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8: 80-89,180-189, etc. So, 4 hundreds \u00d710=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is included). So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything. Let me recount the fours in the tens place. Each hundred block up to 400 has 10 fours in the tens place: 40-49,140-149, etc. So, four blocks \u00d710=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. That's correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place 49, tens place 49 (since in 480-488, it's 9 numbers, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 eights in the tens place.

But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets. From 1-400: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 sets \u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the next set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So total tens place eights:40+9=49. Wait, but wait: from 480-488, that's 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights:0. So total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Wait, let me check again. When counting the tens place for 8's, from 1-400, we have 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the next set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Let me confirm: 488-400+1=89. Yes, that's correct. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the tens place of 4's. For the tens place, I had 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d710=50. But wait, from 1-400, there are four sets:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349, which is 4\u00d710=40. Then, 440-449 is another 10, making it 50. So, that's correct. So, I think my count is accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 4 sets of 10 (40) and 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count the number of hundreds. From 1-400, we have four blocks where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. Each contributes 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the next block would be 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours would be 40 +10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Let's find how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that correct? Let me think: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place eights are 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, with 5 blocks in total (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 eights, with 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. The last set, 480-488, is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, which is 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4 sets x 10 =40, plus 9, so 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 0 to 484, how many? 484 /10 =48.4, but since it's inclusive, it's 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks x10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, but since both ends are included, it's 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four sets are 10 each, 4x10=40. The last set, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So total eights:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: 400-488. The number of pages from 400 to 488 inclusive is 488 - 400 +1 =89.

So, total fours in tens place:50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total.

Yes, that's 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Let me count how many blocks there are. From 1-400, we have 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Each contributes 10 fours, so that's 4*10=40 fours. Then from 400-488, the next block would be 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 +10=50? Wait, no. Wait, 40-49 is in 1-100, so that's one block, then 140-149 is the second, 240-249 third, 340-349 fourth, and 440-449 fifth. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 -400 =88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? That seems high. Let me check again. Wait, no, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? The first is 8, the next is 18, ..., up to 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let's see: 8 +10*(n-1) =488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 times in each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.), and in the last block (480-488), it's 9 times. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. Total:49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, in the hundreds, like 440-449, that's 10 numbers, so that's correct. Similarly, for eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.

    "text": " Let me calculate how many hundreds we have. From 1-400, there are four blocks of 100 where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50. Wait, but from 400-488, the tens digit 4 is only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 40 from the first four hundreds and 10 from 440-449, totaling 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units digit. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 would be part of this. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, we have 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 4's, I included 440-449 as 10 numbers, which is correct because 440-449 is 10 numbers. Similarly, for 8's, in the tens place, from 400-488, I have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480 has 8 in the tens place, and 481-488 have 8 in the tens place as well, so that's 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference is 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the units place for 4's. Let me check again. Units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for 8's, units place is 49, which is correct because 488 is included. So, 49 each. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I think I might have miscounted the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: from 400-488, how many numbers? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. Correct. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - Number of 4's: 49\n\n2. **Tens Place (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449):**\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10, and from 400-488, 440-449 adds another 10.\n   - Total: 50\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (400-488):**\n   - Number of 4's: 89\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - Number of 8's: 49\n\n2. **Tens Place (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488):**\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10, and from 400-488, 480-488 adds 9.\n   - Total: 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, each hundred has a 40-49 block. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does the 440-449 block end at 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? Let's compute (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count each block. From 0-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9 =49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high. Let me go back and verify each step. For fours: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units place:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. But let me think again. Wait, in the tens place for fours, I considered 5 blocks of 10, which is 50 fours. But does that include up to 488? Let me check: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 blocks *10=50. Correct. For the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. For eights: units place:49, tens place:49. Wait, but in the tens place, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 in tens place. Correct. So, total eights:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I feel like that might be too high. Let me think differently. Maybe I should count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately and see if I missed something.\n\nWait, another approach: instead of counting each digit, maybe I can calculate for each position (units, tens, hundreds) how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- For 4: from 4,14,...,484. As before, 49 times.\n- For 8: from 8,18,...,488. Also 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4: in each hundred, 10 times. So 5 hundreds (0-4), so 5*10=50.\n- For 8: in each hundred, 10 times, but the last hundred (400-499) only goes up to 488, so 10 in 80-89, 180-189, etc., but the last one is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n- For 8: none, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 8's, I have 49. So, yes, 98 eights in total.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90. Hmm, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number \u2192 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so it's fine. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers, but the last one might be shorter. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the last block, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9, so 4*10=40 +9=49. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the 4's: units: from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since 484 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units:49. Tens: in each hundred block, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Hundreds:400-488:89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now, 8's: units:8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so 5 sets.

Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many numbers? Let's see, the last number is 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 full blocks of 10, which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from the last partial block, so 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 eights. So, total fours are 188, and total eights are 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.

    "text": " Let's count: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many numbers in each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189:10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place, we have 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That's correct. Units place for both 4 and 8 have 49 each, which makes sense because they both go up to 488, which is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, but 488 is included, so units place for both would have 49 occurrences. So, the calculations seem correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me count the number of hundreds: from 1-400, there are four blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. Then from 400-488, there's another block 440-449, which is 10 more. So, that's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, there are four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the difference between the number of fours and eights is 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I thought from 40-49, 140-149, etc., each block contributes 10 fours. So, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, so 5*10=50. That seems right. For eights, in the tens place, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct.

    "text": " Let me count how many hundreds blocks there are. The first 100 numbers (1-100) have 40-49, which is 10 fours. Then 140-149, another 10, so that's two hundreds. Then 240-249: another 10, that's three hundreds. Then 340-349: another 10, four hundreds. Then 440-449: another 10, five hundreds. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's allowed. So, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 hundreds would give 5*10=50 fours. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last hundred block is 400-488. So, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that's correct. So, total in tens place: 5*10=50 fours. Wait, but let me check: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1-488, how many 4's in units place? Every 10 numbers have one 4. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial group (481-488), there's a 4 in 484. So, 48*1 +1=49 fours in units place. Correct. Tens place: as above, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49 eights. Wait, let me verify: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me just check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178. So, there are 178 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. The first occurrence is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is the 49th number.

So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 178 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 80.

So, each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188? Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484: that's 49 numbers. Tens place: each hundred block has 10, and we have 5 blocks (40-49,140-149, etc.), so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many that is. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be next, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 4,14,...,484: (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. For 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 +9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188.

But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would be part of that range. Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).

So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 49 is 98, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. So, total eights are 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

Wait, no, because 40-49 is in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, 240-249 in the third, 340-349 in the fourth, and 440-449 in the fifth hundred? Wait, no, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds go up to 400-488. So, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's five sets of 10, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but the book only has 488 pages, so 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so let's divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place for fours, I thought there were 5 sets of 10, which is 50, but let me confirm. From 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 5\u00d710=50. Yes, that's correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. So, the total fours are 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

Then, 440-449 is another 10 fours, making it 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is part of the 400-499 range, which is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89).

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Let me check again. For tens place fours: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For eights in tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me calculate how many such blocks there are. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, adding that, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is at 488. Let me count how many. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block. Each hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, adding that, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. From 40-49: 10 fours, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block with 9. So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me think again: when counting the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units and tens place for fours: 49 +50=99. So, total fours: 99+89=188. For eights, units and tens: 49 +49=98. So, 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48.4 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours.\n   - Total blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 eights.\n   - Full blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Partial block (480-488): 9 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me calculate: 5 blocks of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have tens digit 8? Yes, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is included. So, how many blocks? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Let me check how many hundreds we have. The book goes up to 488, which is 4 hundreds. So, from 1-400, we have 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 fours. But wait, from 440-449, that's another 10, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's okay. So, tens place has 40 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 40 = 89, then 89 + 89 = 178. So, 178 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? Let's divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is 48*10 + 8, yes, it's included. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers up to 488. So, that's 49 numbers, same as the fours in units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except possibly the last block. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. So, total number of eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but wait a second: in the tens place, I had 49, and units place also 49, so 98 eights in total. Now, I have 178 fours and 98 eights. So, the difference is 178 - 98 = 80. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many numbers? The formula is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last number is included. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 484 is included, which is 48*10 +4, so the number of 4s in units place is 49. That seems correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block of 100 contributes 10, so 4 blocks would be 40, but wait, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 400-488, the next block would be 440-449, which is another 10, making it 50. Wait, no, because 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, tens place: 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 fours. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40. Hmm, I think I made a mistake there. Let me clarify: from 1-100: 40-49:10 fours. 101-200:140-149:10. 201-300:240-249:10. 301-400:340-349:10. Then, 401-488:440-449:10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. So, that's 50, not 40. So, earlier I was wrong, it's 50 fours in the tens place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, so 188 fours. Now, for eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, so I had a mistake earlier in counting the tens place for fours. So, the correct total fours are 188, eights are 98, so 188-98=90. But let me double-check the hundreds place for fours: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct. Tens place: 50 fours. Units place:49. So, 89+50=139, 139+49=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 80, but now it's 90. Let me make sure I didn't make another mistake. Let me recount the tens place for fours: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. That's correct. So, total fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I initially thought it was 80, but after correcting the tens place for fours, it's 90. Let me check another way: maybe by calculating the total number of digits and seeing if the counts make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position. The formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + (1 if the last digit is >=d else 0). Similarly, for the tens place, it's floor(n/100)*10 + max(0, min(n%100 +1, 10) if the tens digit is >=d else 0). Hmm, maybe that's a more systematic way. Let me try that for fours and eights. First, for fours in units place: n=488. floor(488/10)=48. Since 488%10=8 >=4, so add 1. So, units fours:48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for fours: floor(488/100)=4. So, 4*10=40. Now, the last two digits are 88. The tens digit is 8, which is >=4, so we add min(88+1, 10) if the tens digit is >=4. Wait, but the tens digit is 8, which is >=4, so we add min(88+1, 10)=9. So, total tens fours:40+9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 50. Hmm, this is conflicting. Wait, maybe I'm misapplying the formula. Let me check the formula again. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to n is calculated as follows: Let higher = n / 100, current = (n / 10) % 10, lower = n % 10. If current > d, then count = (higher + 1) * 10. If current == d, then count = (higher + 1) * 10 + (lower + 1). If current < d, then count = higher * 10. So, for fours in tens place, d=4. higher = 488 / 100 = 4 (integer division). current = (488 / 10) % 10 = 48 %10=8. lower=488%10=8. Since current=8 > d=4, count=(4+1)*10=5*10=50. So, the formula gives 50 fours in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, earlier, when I thought it was 49, I was wrong. The correct count is 50 fours in the tens place. So, total fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. So, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Now, for eights: units place. Using the formula: floor(488/10)=48, since 488%10=8 >=8, add 1. So, units eights:48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for eights: higher=488/100=4, current=(488/10)%10=8, lower=8. Since current=8 >=d=8, count=(4+1)*10 + (lower +1)=5*10 +9=50+9=59? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is: if current > d, count=(higher+1)*10. If current ==d, count=(higher+1)*10 + (lower +1). So, for eights in tens place, d=8. higher=4, current=8, lower=8. Since current==d, count=(4+1)*10 + (8+1)=50 +9=59. But wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 49. Wait, no, let me check again. Wait, the formula is for the number of times the digit appears in the tens place. So, up to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total is 4*10 +9=49. But according to the formula, it's giving me 59. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm applying the formula incorrectly. Let me try again. For the tens place, d=8. higher = floor(488 / 100)=4. current = floor(488 /10) %10=48%10=8. lower = 488%10=8. Since current >=d, we do: count = (higher +1)*10 + (lower +1) if current >d, but wait, no. Wait, the formula is: if current > d, count = (higher +1)*10. If current ==d, count = (higher +1)*10 + (lower +1). So, in this case, current=8, d=8, so count=(4+1)*10 + (8 +1)=50 +9=59. But that's not matching with the manual count of 49. So, I must be misunderstanding the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is intended for numbers beyond a certain point, or maybe I'm misapplying it. Let me think differently. The number of times 8 appears in the tens place up to 488 is as follows: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, the formula must be giving me 59 because it's counting up to 489, not 488. Because if n=489, then lower=9, so count=(4+1)*10 +9=59. But since n=488, lower=8, so count=(4+1)*10 +8=58? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the formula is designed for numbers where the lower digits can go up to 9, but in our case, it's 8. So, perhaps the formula is not directly applicable here, or I'm misapplying it. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the manual count, which gives 49 eights in the tens place. So, perhaps the formula is giving me a different result because it's considering numbers beyond 488, which we don't have. So, I think the manual count is more accurate here, giving 49 eights in the tens place. Therefore, total eights: units 49 + tens 49 =98. So, total fours:188, eights:98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me count how many such blocks there are. The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. But 0 would be the first 100 numbers (1-100), but 40-49 is within that. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me see how many numbers that is. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term can be expressed as 8 + 10(n-1). So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Let's solve for n: 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so 9). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This totals 49 eights.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are four blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, from 450-488, the tens digit is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, so no more fours in the tens place beyond 449. So, tens place contributes 40 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178. So, total fours: 178. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find the count, I can subtract 8 from 488 and divide by 10, then add 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and then 9 more in 480-488. So, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 178 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 80. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place 49, tens 40, hundreds 89. 49+40=89, 89+89=178. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 178-98=80. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. Wait, when counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place, not 40. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? Let me recount. From 40-49: 10 fours, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's five blocks, each with 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. Earlier, I thought it was four blocks, but actually, 440-449 is the fifth block because 400-488 includes 440-449. So, I think I made a mistake there. So, correcting that, the tens place for fours is 50, not 40. So, total fours: units 49 + tens 50 + hundreds 89 = 49+50=99; 99+89=188. Now, for eights, let's check again. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds:0. Total eights:98. So, now, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that's different. So, where did I go wrong earlier? Let me re-examine the tens place for fours. The hundreds go up to 400-488. So, in the tens place, 4 can be in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. So, yes, earlier I had mistakenly counted only four blocks, which was incorrect. So, the correct total fours is 188, and eights are 98, so the difference is 90. But wait, let me make sure about the units place for fours. From 4, 14, 24,...,484. How many numbers is that? The last number is 484, which is 484 = 4 + 10*(n-1). So, 484 - 4 = 480 = 10*(n-1), so n-1=48, so n=49. So, units place has 49 fours. That's correct. Similarly, for eights in units place, same logic: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, so 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. For tens place in fours: 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. For tens place in eights: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, earlier I thought 480-488 has 9 numbers, but actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for tens place eights, it's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49. So, eights in tens place: 49. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, fours:188, eights:98. Difference:188-98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought the difference was 80, but after correcting the tens place for fours, it's 90. Let me confirm once more. Fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total:49+50=99, 99+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct now. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each block (except 480-488) contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"
