    "text": " So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is the sum of units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4x10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, the total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as the book doesn't reach 800.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, meaning 48 eights in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 times. Wait, because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps? The first term is 8, the last term is 488, and the common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480-489 would be 10, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block which only has 9. Let me count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 blocks with 10 each, and one block with 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9 =49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, 48, but wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's check: 8, 18, ..., 488. So, starting at 8, each step of 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, in the tens place, 8 appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block, which might be incomplete. So, from 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Wait, let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I counted the units place for 4's, I got 49, and for 8's also 49. That seems correct because from 1 to 488, each digit 4 and 8 appears 49 times in the units place. Then, for tens place, 4's had 50, and 8's had 49. So, the difference comes from the hundreds place, where 4's have 89, and 8's have 0. So, 89 more fours in the hundreds place. So, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. For 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. That seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, every number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers, since 488 is included. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 (480,481,...,488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Correct. For eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 49 in total. Units place is 49, so 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours was 89, but let me confirm that 400-488 is 89 numbers. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Yes, correct. So, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 8 is the first, 18 is the second, and so on. Let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place, which is 48 times? Wait, no. Because 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: Here, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 eights. So total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. For 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10=40, and 480-488 contributes 9, so total 49. Yes, that's correct. So total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the hundreds place? For the 4's in hundreds place, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. For the 8's in hundreds place, none, since 488 is less than 800. Correct. Hmm, seems correct. So, the difference is 90.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, which suggests 49 numbers (since 488 is included). Wait, but let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. Each set from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me go back and check each part again. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98=90.

So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers up to 488, that's 49 times. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I counted the tens place for eights, I had 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, I had 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct.

This results in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** From page 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is '4' for 89 numbers.\n   \n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), resulting in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit '8' appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. This gives 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   \n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed **90** times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 count as 10 numbers? Yes, because 440 to 449 is 10 numbers. So, 5 sets \u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, but since we include both endpoints, it's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Let's see: The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 = 8 + (49-1)*10 = 8 + 480 = 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers with 8 in units place? The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 =40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188 fours.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four blocks give 10 each, and the last block gives 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, no, 49+49=98? Wait, 49+49 is 98? Wait, 49+49=98? Let me check: 49+49 is indeed 98. So, total eights:98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the fours again. Units place: from 4,14,...484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: Units place:8,18,...488. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks gives 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) gives 9 eights. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place:0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And in the tens place, 50 fours. Units place, 49 fours. So, 188 total. For eights, units and tens each 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is the fifth set, right? Because 40-49 is the first, 140-149 second, and so on up to 440-449, which is the fifth. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, so floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. From 1-488, how many hundreds? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, but in each of these, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So, 4 hundreds \u00d710=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. That's correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89= 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** Similar to fours, but 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count. Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, 40+9=49 eights in tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's a big difference. Let me double-check my counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me check if I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct. Each has a 4 in hundreds place, so 89 fours. For eights, in the tens place, I had 49. Let me recount the tens place for eights. From 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Then, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Units place: 49 eights, correct. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, fours:188, eights:98. Difference: 90.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484: from 0 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 484 /10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: each hundred has 10, and there are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since the book stops at 488, the hundreds place 4 only goes up to 488. So, how many hundreds blocks? From 0-99: 40-49:10. 100-199:140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 450-488 would have 4 in the hundreds place but not in the tens. Wait, no, 450-488: the hundreds digit is 4, so from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, but when considering the tens digit, 440-449 is part of that. So, for the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. So, total 4's:188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total tens place eights:49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights:0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.

Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place, which is floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so the last set is 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. So, 4 blocks, each with 10 eights.

So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49+40=89. So, total 8's: 89. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total 188. For 8's: units=49, tens=40, hundreds=0. Total 89. So, 188-89=99.

So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4, which occurs in all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: Units place:49, Tens place:50, Hundreds place:89. Total number of 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For the tens place, each 100 numbers have 10 fours in the tens place, so from 1-400, that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40 fours. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit being 4 is only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours would be 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) each with 10 fours, so 4*10=40, plus the 10 fours in 440-449, making it 50. So that's correct. Units place: every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place, so from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 after that. The last one is at 484. So, how many terms are in this sequence? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 4, ending at 484, with a common difference of 10. The nth term is given by a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1, so n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me check if I counted correctly. Wait, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high, but maybe it's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The common difference is 10. So, the nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Subtract 8: 10(n-1)=480. Divide by 10: n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the book. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 eights. So, that's 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, but in the tens place, each number from 480-488 has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding them up: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. Total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units place:49, Tens place:50, Hundreds place:89. Total:49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again. Wait, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, in 440-449, that's 10 fours, and each of the other sets (40-49, etc.) adds 10 each, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Units place: every 10 numbers, 49 times. So, 49 fours. So, 188 fours. For 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98 eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me check if I counted the tens place correctly for 8's. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 10*4 +9=49. Correct. So, yes, 98 eights. So, the difference is 90.

So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only considering the hundreds digit, which is 4 for all these numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these numbers, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers are there? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, let me calculate that: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488).\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 8 to 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 actually fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is included. So, how many 8's are there in the units place? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. So, taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 0, 8 is the 1st, 18 the 2nd, ..., 488 the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count. Each full hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, the next set would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total.

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only interested in how many times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, but let me check that again. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because when I think about it, 488 is the last page, so in the hundreds place, it's only 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. Now, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we have to include 488, so it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, I need to find how many more 4's there are than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights:98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: Units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 +89= 188 fours. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 more than 480. So, how many terms? From 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again: when counting the hundreds place for fours, I included 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. But when I think about page numbers, page 400 is the first page with a 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 +1=89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Similarly, for the tens place, I had five blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Units place, 49. So, 188 fours. For eights, units and tens each have 49, so 98 eights. Thus, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 484 is the last one. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units: 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50.

The first is 8, the last is 488. How many terms? (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers, except the last one. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. When I count 80-89, that's 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, that's correct. So, 49 in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that in the hundreds place, 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.

So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does that mean the units digit is 8 in 488, which is the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours than eights, subtract the total eights from total fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89) = 188. For eights: units (49), tens (49) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. The hundreds place for fours is from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so that's correct. For eights, the hundreds place is 0, correct. Units place for fours: 49, correct. Tens place for fours: 5 blocks of 10, so 50, correct. Units place for eights: 49, correct. Tens place for eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49, correct. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90.

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see, how many such numbers? The last number is 488, which is 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many tens blocks have 8 in the tens place. Each block contributes 10 eights, except maybe the last one. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 4 blocks with 10 eights and one block with 9 eights. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the hundreds place for fours is 89, which seems correct because from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. And for eights, the hundreds place is 0 because 800 is beyond 488. So, I think the calculations are correct.

So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400 is included, so yes, that's correct. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total.

Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block of 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place.

So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The last occurrence is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. So, 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range. So, how many eights in the tens place? Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. From 1-400: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389: 4 sets, each 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the tens place, from 400-488, the 8 in the tens place occurs 9 times. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 -98=90.

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the fours from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let's check if 488 is included. 8, 18, ..., 488: that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, for the tens place, the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) each have 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) has 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9 = 40 +9 =49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours -98 eights =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th number because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block. Let's count each block: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10 because 489 is beyond 488). So, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so that's okay. So, 5 sets \u00d710 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, let me check that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is included. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 +9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the hundreds place for 8's would be zero, but let me confirm: Since the book only has up to 488 pages, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, no page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights there. So total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, how many more fours are there than eights? 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the fours again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? The first is 4, the last is 484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10, the last is 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None (pages go up to 488) \u2192 0 occurrences.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count how many blocks of 100 have 8 in the tens place. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them except 480-488. Wait, no, 480 has tens digit 8, 481 has 8, ..., 488 has 8. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, 480-488:9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

So, 4*10=40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. But wait, does that include 484? Let me see: 484 is the 49th number because starting from 4, each 10 numbers add one. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 fours. From 0-488, how many hundred blocks? 5: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but in each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours. But wait, the last block is 400-488, which is 89 numbers, but the tens digit being 4 occurs only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many full blocks: 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, so fours are 188, eights are 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. But wait, that seems too high. Let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I overcounted the fours in the hundreds place. Let me recount the fours:\n\n- Units place: 49 fours (from 4,14,...,484). Correct.\n- Tens place: 5 blocks of 10, so 5*10=50 fours. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, eights:\n\n- Units place: 49 eights (from 8,18,...,488). Correct.\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total eights: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but 90 seems like a lot. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but does that include 400? Yes, because 400 is page 400, which is included. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for fours. From 40-49, 140-149, etc. Wait, 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449, which is 10. So, 5 blocks, each 10, so 50 fours. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, in the tens place, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, etc., up to 480-488, which is 9. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for eights. From 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49+49=98.\n\nFours:188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking how many more 4's than 8's. So, the answer is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure because sometimes in counting digits, we might miss something, but I think I did it correctly. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternative method: For each digit position, calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 4's: as above, 49.\n- For 8's: 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: 50.\n- For 8's:49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4's:89.\n- For 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488.

So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, because 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. I said that in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, so numbers 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's correct. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, total eights:98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours:188.

Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488-480+1=9. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for that last block. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights) =90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for fours again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. That's correct. Units place for both 4 and 8 have 49 each, which seems right. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last, which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
