Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n   - Number of 4's = 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, and we take the integer part plus 1).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of 4's = 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total number of 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of 8's = 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and we take the integer part plus 1).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n   - Total = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n   - Number of 8's = 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.**\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, total 8's:49+49=98. Correct. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something, but the counts seem right. Let me think differently: maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units digit: For 488 pages, how many times does each digit appear in the units place? For units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often except possibly the last few if 488 isn't a multiple of 10. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, with 8 remaining. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, and then digits 0-8 appear once more in the last partial cycle. So, for units digit, 4 appears 48 +1=49 times. Similarly, 8 appears 48 +1=49 times. Wait, that's different from my earlier count where I thought 8's in units place were 49, but 4's were 49 as well. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 49 fours and 49 eights in units place, which seems correct. Then, moving on to tens place: For tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. Since we have 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in 400 pages, each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (400) up to 8 (480-488). So, in 401-488, the tens digits are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-488). Wait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. So, for the tens digit in the last 88 pages: digits 0-8 each appear 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times. Wait, no, actually, in the 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each digit 0-8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which might be cut short. Wait, let me think again. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears only 8 times (since 481-488 is 8 numbers). So, for each tens digit 0-7, they appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, in the tens place, for the last 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times (in 401-410, 411-420, etc.), but wait, no, in 401-410, the tens digit is 0, so 4 would appear in the tens place in 440-449, but that's in the hundreds place. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in the tens place across all pages. Let me try this again. For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-400) and 88 pages (401-488). So, in the first 400 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, each digit 0-8 appears how many times? From 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers. 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers. ... 471-480: tens digit 7, 10 numbers. 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 numbers. So, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 8 times. So, in the tens place, for the last 88 pages: 0 appears 10, 1 appears 10, ..., 7 appears 10, 8 appears 8. So, for digit 4 in the tens place, in the last 88 pages, it appears 10 times (in 440-449). Wait, no, 440-449 would be within the 400-499 range, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is within 401-488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 440-449. So, total for 4 in tens place: first 400 pages: 40 times, plus 10 times in 440-449, so 50 times. Which matches my earlier count. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place: first 400 pages: 40 times, plus in the last 88 pages, 8 appears 8 times (in 481-488). So, total 40 +8=48 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me see. Wait, in the first 400 pages, the tens digit 8 appears 40 times (4 times 10). Then, in the last 88 pages, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so 8 more times. So, total 40 +8=48 times. But earlier, I thought it was 49. So, which is correct? Let me recount. When I first counted the tens place for 8's, I considered 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. But now, using the other method, it's 48. There's a discrepancy here. Let me figure out where I went wrong. Oh, I see. In the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, but the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 occurrences, not 8. So, in the last 88 pages, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 8. Therefore, total for 8's in tens place: 40 (from first 400 pages) +9=49. So, that aligns with my initial count. So, the correct number is 49. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 49 times. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49)=98. So, the initial count was correct. Now, going back, for 4's in the tens place, in the last 88 pages, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, 40 (from first 400) +10=50. Correct. So, 4's in tens place:50. So, total 4's:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit from the right):** \n     - Occurs in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n     - Total: 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit from the right):**\n     - Occurs in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n     - Total: 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit from the right):**\n     - Occurs in numbers 400-488.\n     - Total: 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Occurs in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n     - Total: 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Occurs in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n     - Total: 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n     - Total: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

The count is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers:\n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n   - **Total 4's:** Adding up all occurrences:\n     \\[\n     49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n     \\]\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). The count is:\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\quad \\text{(but including 8, it's 49)}\n     \\]\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks of 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).

Just to make sure, maybe I can think of a smaller example to see if my method works. Let's say a book with 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's? Units place: 4,14: 2 fours. Tens place: 40-49 would be beyond 20, so 0. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 4's:2. Units place:8,18:2 eights. Tens place:80-89: beyond 20, so 0. Hundreds place:0. So, total 8's:2. Difference:0. Hmm, but according to my method, for 20 pages, units 4's: (20-4)/10 +1? Wait, no, maybe my initial formula was (last - first)/step +1. So, for 4's in units place up to 20: first=4, last=14 (since 24 is beyond 20). So, (14-4)/10 +1= (10)/10 +1=2. Correct. So, 2 fours. Similarly, 8's: first=8, last=18. So, (18-8)/10 +1=2. So, 2 eights. Difference 0. Correct. So, my method works for this small case. Another example: 50 pages. 4's: units: 4,14,24,34,44:5 fours. Tens:40-49:10, but 40-49 is within 50, so 10 fours. Hundreds:0. Total 4's:15. 8's: units:8,18,28,38,48:5 eights. Tens:40-49: but 80-89 is beyond 50, so only 80-89 isn't there. Wait, 50 is the limit. So, 8's in tens place: 80-89 isn't in 50, so 0. So, total 8's:5. Difference:15-5=10. Let me check: page numbers 1-50. 4's: units 5, tens 10, total 15. 8's: units 5, tens 0, total 5. Difference 10. Correct. So, my method works.

    "text": " So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I missed something. Let me think again. Wait, in the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488 is 89 numbers. But does 488 include the hundreds digit 4? Yes, because 488 is 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. For the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). That's correct. So, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds. So, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. When I count the units place for 4's, I have 4,14,...,484. How many terms is that? Let's see: the first term is 4, which is 4=4+10*0, the next is 14=4+10*1, and so on. The last term is 484=4+10*48. So, the number of terms is 49, because it's from k=0 to k=48, which is 49 terms. Correct. Similarly, for the 8's in units place, 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488=8+10*48, so the number of terms is 49. Correct. For the tens place 4's, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 in 400-488 would be from 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, 400-488 includes 400-409 (10 numbers), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), and then 450-459, etc., but wait, no, the tens digit cycles every 100. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488. Wait, but in the tens place, 4's in 400-488: how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let me think: 400-409: 10 numbers with tens digit 4. 410-419:10, same. 420-429:10, 430-439:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. So, 50 is correct. Similarly, for the 8's in the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488.

    "text": " So total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check the tens place again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, then 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens, 49 in units, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For a 3-digit number, each position (units, tens, hundreds) can be considered separately. Let's do that for both 4 and 8. Starting with 4's: - Units place: In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. So, 488 /10 =48.8, which means 48 full blocks and a partial block. So, 48*1=48, plus in the partial block (481-488), 484 is included, which is another 4 in the units place, making it 49. - Tens place: In every block of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, 488 /100 =4.88, so 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours:40+10=50. - Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as calculated before. So, 89 fours. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. Now for 8's: - Units place: Similarly, in every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the partial block (481-488), 488 is included, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, 48+1=49. - Tens place: In every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). So, 488 /100=4.88, so 4 full blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. - Hundreds place: As before, no 8's here. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, yes, the difference is 90.
