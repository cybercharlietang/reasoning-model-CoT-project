    "text": " So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me think again: when counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. And for 8's, the tens place only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This occurs every 10 numbers, starting from 4 up to 484. The count is calculated as (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48.4 \u2192 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n   Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This occurs every 10 numbers, starting from 8 up to 488. The count is (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9 numbers. So, 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n   Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."
