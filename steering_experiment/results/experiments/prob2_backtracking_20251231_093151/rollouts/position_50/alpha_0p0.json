    "text": " Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89 is 10, each of the next three decades (180-189, etc.) is another 10 each, so that's 3*10=30, and then 480-488 is 9. So total is 10+30+9=49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, but let me make sure. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just go through again to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me check the tens place for eights again. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. That's 5 sets, with the last set having 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. For fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. Correct. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, up to 484. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly, for eights in units place, from 8,18,...,488. That's (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=49. Correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last, which contributes 9, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights) =90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, okay, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. Each hundred block (e.g., 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.
