    "text": " Wait, let me recount. Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. That seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. Now, let me make sure about the tens place for fours. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Correct. Units place for fours: from 4,14,...484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. So, fours total 188. For eights, units place: 8,18,...488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, total 49.

So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of 4's:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Number of 4's:  \n     \\[\n     5 \\text{ blocks} \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   - Number of 4's:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 (\\text{units}) + 50 (\\text{tens}) + 89 (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of 8's:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which contributes 9.  \n   - Number of 8's:  \n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ blocks} \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of 8's: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 (\\text{units}) + 49 (\\text{tens}) + 0 (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Hmm, so that's 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90.

    "text": " Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, each of the next three sets is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights are 98. But earlier, fours were 188, so the difference would be 188 -98=90. Hmm, but I feel like I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Let me double-check the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Then 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, fours were 188.
