So, in the 4's count, hundreds place includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 9 fours added in the hundreds place. Wait, but earlier I counted 89 fours in the hundreds place, which includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, that's correct. So, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But let me just make sure I didn't double-count any digits. For example, in 440-449, each number has a 4 in the hundreds and tens place, so each contributes two 4's. So, in my count, units place: 440-449 would have 4's in the units place as well, but wait, no. Wait, 440-449: the units digits go from 0-9, so 440,441,...,449. So, the units digits here include 4 in 444, which I've already counted in the units place. So, in the hundreds place, I have 89 fours, which includes 440-449, each of which has a 4 in the hundreds place. In the tens place, 440-449 is part of the 440-449 set, which contributes 10 fours in the tens place. And in the units place, 444 is one of the 49 fours in the units place. So, each occurrence is counted separately, so no double-counting. So, I think my total is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Maybe I should think differently. Let me count the number of 4's in each position again. Units: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is floor(488/10)=48, but since 484 is included, it's 48 +1=49. Correct. Tens: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, 0-99: 40-49 (10), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), and 400-488:440-449 (10). Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, 49+50+89=188. Now, for 8's: Units: 8,18,...,488. The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds: none. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I feel like 90 might be the correct answer, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately again, just to be sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a different counting method. Let's try another approach for the 4's: For each digit position, calculate how many times 4 appears. 1. **Units place:** For each complete set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1 four, so 48. But wait, the last set is 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so the units digit in 481-488 includes 484, which is a four. So, in the incomplete set from 481-488, the units digit is 4 at 484. So, total units place fours: 48 (from complete sets) +1 (from the incomplete set) =49. Correct. 2. **Tens place:** For each complete set of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? 4 complete hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, that's actually 5 sets, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers. But for the tens place, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, for the 8's: 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, each 10 numbers have one 8. From 1-488, 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1 eight, so 48. But in the incomplete set 481-488, the units digit 8 occurs at 488, so that's an additional 1. So, total units eights:48+1=49. 2. **Tens place:** Each 100 numbers have a set where the tens digit is 8, e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such set has 10 numbers. How many complete sets are there in 488? 0-99:80-89 (10), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488 (9 numbers, since 489 is beyond 488). So, 4 complete sets of 10 and one incomplete set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** None, as before. So, total eights:49+49=98. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which has 9.\n   - Total: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

For units place: as before, 49. For tens place: in each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, 10 numbers have 4 in the tens place. How many hundreds do we have? From 0-488, that's 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, not a full hundred. So, for the tens place, in each full hundred (0-99, 100-199, etc.), there are 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40, and then in the last partial hundred (400-488), how many tens digits are 4? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 +10=50. Correct. Units place: as before, 49. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 hundreds place 4's. So, 49+50+89=188. That's consistent. Now, for 8's: units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. So, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. Units place:8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term because (488-8)/10=48, so 48+1=49. Correct.

Hmm, that's 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach for the units and tens places. For units place in 4's: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48, but since 488 is included, the last 4 is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place, same logic: 49 eights. So, same as before. For tens place, 4's: each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. From 1-400, there are 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 50 fours in tens place. Correct. For 8's in tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. From 1-400, there are 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49 eights in tens place. Correct. Hundreds place: 4's from 400-488: 89 numbers. 8's: none.

Wait, actually, the last block is only up to 488, which is less than 500, so does that affect the count? Wait, from 400-488, the tens digit being 4 is only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So, in the tens place, we have 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct. So, 50 in tens place. Units place: 49.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that in the hundreds place, when counting 4's, I included 440-449, but when counting 8's, in the tens place, I included 480-488. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should check with a smaller number to see if my method works. Let's say a book with 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's? Page numbers 1-20. 4's: 4,14. So, 2 fours. 8's:8,18. So, 2 eights. So, difference is 0. Let me apply my method: Units place: 4,14: 2 fours. Tens place: 40-49 isn't in 20, so 0. Hundreds: none. So, total 2 fours. Units place for 8's:8,18:2. Tens place:80-89 not in 20, so 0. So, total 2 eights. So, difference 0. Correct. Another example: 100 pages. Let's count 4's and 8's. Units: 4,14,...,94: 10 numbers (since 94 is 9*10 +4). Wait, 100 pages, so 100 is included. So, units place: 4,14,...,94: that's 10 numbers. Tens place:40-49:10 numbers. Hundreds place: none. So, total 4's:10+10=20. 8's: units:8,18,...,98:10 numbers. Tens place:80-89:10 numbers. Hundreds: none. So, total 8's:10+10=20. Difference 0. Hmm, but in 100 pages, the difference is 0, but in 488 pages, it's 90. That seems plausible because as the number of pages increases beyond 100, the hundreds place starts contributing more 4's than 8's. Wait, in 488 pages, the hundreds place has 89 fours, but no eights. So, that's a big difference. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place, and 0 eights there. So, that's where the difference comes from. So, I think my calculation is correct.
