Did I count correctly? Another way to count the 4's: For units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so total pages is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, which gives 48 fours, but since 488 is included, we have an extra 4 in the units place (484). So, 48 +1=49. Correct. Similarly, for tens place, every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct. For 8's: Units place: same logic, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, plus one more at 488, so 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Correct. So, 188 -98=90.

And for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9, not 10. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for the last set. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me think if I'm missing something. Maybe I'm counting correctly, but let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position again. For 4's: Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full cycles, but since 488 is included, it's 49. Wait, but 488 is 488, so 4 in units place is at 4,14,...,484. So, 484 is the last one. So, 484 is 48*10 +4, so 48 full cycles, but since we start at 4, which is the first occurrence, it's 49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so 400/100=4 hundreds, but wait, up to 488, so actually, it's 4 full hundreds (1-400) plus 88 pages. So, in each hundred, 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So, 4 hundreds would give 40, but wait, no, actually, each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. But then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's: 40 +10=50. Correct. Hundreds digit: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188. Correct. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers, as before. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I've double-checked enough. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

Correct. - Tens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds place: none. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Correct. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? Because sometimes when you have overlapping, like in the hundreds place, but I don't think that's an issue here. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method to cross-verify. Let me try a different approach. For each digit position, count the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Starting with the units place: - For units place, from 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears equally often except possibly the last set. For units digit, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (since 488/10=48.8). But since we're starting from 1, not 0, the 0 appears one less time. Wait, but I'm counting 4's and 8's. So, for units digit, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? It's 48 full cycles (1-480), which gives 48 times, plus 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times. Similarly, for 8's in units place, it's 48 full cycles (1-480), giving 48 times, plus 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought units place for 8's was 49, which matches. So, 4's in units:49, 8's:49. Then, tens place: For tens digit, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the tens place (since 488/100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times per digit, so 4*10=40, but wait, that's not right. Wait, actually, for the tens digit, each digit appears 10 times in each hundred. So, from 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 times per digit in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, so digits 0-8 each appear 9 times (since 488 is 488, so 488-400=88, so 88/10=8.8, so 8 full tens, each contributing 10 times, but wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. The tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the last tens digit is 8, but only 8 numbers (481-488). Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think again. For the tens digit, from 1-488, how many times does each digit appear? Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the tens place because 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times per digit, so 4*10=40, plus in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles 0-8, each appearing 9 times except 8, which appears 8 times because 488 is the last number. Wait, no. Let me think differently. From 1-488, the number of times each digit appears in the tens place is as follows: For digits 0-8: Each appears 48 times because 488 /100 =4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40, plus in the last 88 numbers (401-488), each digit from 0-8 appears 8 times (since 88/10=8.8, so 8 full tens). Wait, but 88 is 8*11, so maybe 8 times for each digit. So, total for each digit 0-8: 40 +8=48. For digit 9: It appears 4 times in the tens place, in 90-99, 190-199, 290-299, 390-399, but in 401-488, there's no 490-499, so digit 9 in tens place only appears 4 times. Wait, but I'm counting 8's and 4's, so let's focus on those. So, for the tens digit: 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times. But wait, earlier I thought 4's in tens place were 50, which contradicts this. Hmm, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. When I count the tens digit, I can't just count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place by looking at ranges like 40-49, etc., because that might double-count or miss something. Let me try the formula approach. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N can be calculated as follows:\n\n- For each complete hundred (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.), the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 for d=4).\n- Then, for the remaining part beyond the complete hundreds, say from (k*100 +1) to N, the tens digit d appears min(d, (N - k*100)) times if d is less than or equal to the tens digit of N, otherwise 10 times.\n\nWait, maybe that's too complicated. Let me try with N=488.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds in 488: 4 (1-400).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for d=4, that's 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, the remaining numbers are from 401-488, which is 88 numbers.\n\nIn these 88 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490), but since we stop at 488, the last tens digit is 8, but only up to 488.\n\nSo, for the tens digit in 401-488:\n\n- Tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 9 times? Wait, 88 numbers: 88 /10=8.8, so each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 8 times, except the last one, which appears 8 times as well because 488 is the 8th number in the 80-89 group (480-489). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me list the tens digits from 401-488:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nWait, that's not correct because 480-488 is 9 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 8. Let me recount:\n\nFrom 401-488:\n\n- 401-410: 10 numbers, tens digit 0\n- 411-420:10, tens 1\n- 421-430:10, tens 2\n- 431-440:10, tens 3\n- 441-450:10, tens 4\n- 451-460:10, tens 5\n- 461-470:10, tens 6\n- 471-480:10, tens 7\n- 481-488:8 numbers, tens 8\n\nWait, but 480 is included in 471-480 as tens digit 7, right? So, 480 is part of 471-480, which is 10 numbers (471-480). Then, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, in the remaining part, digit 4 in tens place:10, digit 8:8.\n\nSo, total for tens digit:\n\n- 4: 40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50\n- 8: 40 (from complete hundreds) +8=48\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 8's in tens place were 49, but now with this method, it's 48. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, when I initially counted the 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That adds up to 10+10+10+10+9=49. But according to this other method, it's 40 from complete hundreds plus 8 in the last partial hundred, totaling 48. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial counting. Let me check again. From 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears in:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nThat's 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nBut according to the other method, it's 40 (from 4 complete hundreds) plus 8 in the last partial hundred, totaling 48. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the assumption that each complete hundred contributes 10 times per digit. Let me think: each hundred has 100 numbers, so the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each digit d in 0-9, it appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. So, from 1-400, which is 4 hundreds, each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, with 0 appearing 10 times (401-410), 1:10 (411-420), ..., up to 7:10 (471-480), and 8:8 (481-488). So, in the last 88 numbers, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times. Therefore, total for 8 in tens place:40 +8=48. But earlier, I thought it was 49. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial counting method was wrong. Because when I count 80-89, 180-189, etc., each of those is 10 numbers, but in the last set, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so it's 9 instead of 10. So, total 49. But according to the other method, it's 48. There's a contradiction. Let me check with a smaller number to see which method is correct. Let's say N=100. How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 1-100, it's 10 times (80-89). Using the first method: 1 complete hundred, so 10 times. Using the second method: 1*10=10, plus 0 in the last partial hundred, so total 10. Correct.\n\nNow, N=108. How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? 80-89:10, and 108 is included, but 108 has tens digit 0, so total 10 times. Using the first method: 10 times. Using the second method: 1*10=10, plus in the last 8 numbers (101-108), the tens digit is 0, so no additional 8's. So, 10. Correct.\n\nNow, N=118. Tens digit 8:80-89:10, 180-189 doesn't apply here, so total 10. Using the second method: 1*10=10, plus in 101-118, the tens digit goes up to 1, so no 8's. So, 10. Correct.\n\nNow, N=188. Tens digit 8:80-89:10, 180-188:9 (since 180-188 is 9 numbers, tens digit 8). So, total 19. Using the second method: 1 complete hundred (1-100) gives 10, plus in 101-188, the tens digit 8 appears in 180-188:9 times. So, total 10+9=19. Correct.\n\nSo, applying this to N=488, the tens digit 8 appears in:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nTotal:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nBut according to the other method, it's 40 (from 4 complete hundreds) plus 8 in the last partial hundred (401-488), totaling 48. So, which is correct? It seems the initial method is correct, giving 49, while the second method gives 48. Where's the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps in the second method, I miscalculated the last partial hundred. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times, not 8. So, in the last partial hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 8. Therefore, the correct total should be 40 +9=49. So, the second method was wrong because I thought it was 8, but it's actually 9.\n\nSo, to correct that, the number of times 8 appears in the tens place from 401-488 is 9, not 8. Therefore, total 8's in tens place:40 +9=49. So, that aligns with the initial count. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 8; it's actually 9.\n\nSo, correcting that, the total number of 8's in the tens place is 49.\n\nWait, but earlier when I broke down 401-488 into 401-410 (tens 0), 411-420 (1), ..., 481-488 (8), I thought the last group was 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times. But 480-488 is actually 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 numbers, hence 9 times. So, I was wrong earlier when I said 8 times; it's 9 times.\n\nTherefore, the correct count is 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place:40 +10=50.\n\nSo, now, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89)=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there might be a mistake because I got two different counts for the 8's in the tens place, but now I've corrected that to 49. So, the final answer should be 90.\n\nWait, but let me just cross-verify once more.\n\nTotal 4's:188\n\nTotal 8's:98\n\nDifference:90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1 occurrence every 10 numbers):**\n   - From 4, 14, ..., 484: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place (10 occurrences per block of 100):**\n   - Blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Total: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (400-488):**\n   - 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1 occurrence every 10 numbers):**\n   - From 8, 18, ..., 488: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place (10 occurrences per block of 100, except the last block):**\n   - Blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Total: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Maybe I can think of a different way to count, just to confirm. Alternatively, I could consider each digit position separately and count the number of 4's and 8's in each position, then sum them up. Let's try that. For the units digit: Each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last set if the total number isn't a multiple of 10. So, for 488 pages, the units digit cycles 48 full times (since 488 /10=48.8). Each cycle has one 4 and one 8. So, units digit: 48 cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, we have 8 more numbers (481-488), which are 481,482,...,488. The units digits here are 1-8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units digit total: 48+1=49 fours and 48+1=49 eights. That's consistent with my earlier count. Now, the tens digit: Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for 488 pages, we have 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and 80-488. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think differently. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for 488 pages, we have 4 full hundreds (0-399) and then 80-488. Wait, no, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, the tens digit in the first 400 pages (0-399) would have each digit 0-9 appearing 40 times in the tens place (because 4 hundreds, each with 10 occurrences per digit). Then, from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0-8 (since 488 is 4-8-8). Wait, let me see: From 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? - 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 numbers\n- 410-419: tens digit 1, 10\n- 420-429: tens digit 2,10\n- 430-439: tens digit3,10\n- 440-449: tens digit4,10\n- 450-459: tens digit5,10\n- 460-469: tens digit6,10\n- 470-479: tens digit7,10\n- 480-488: tens digit8,9 numbers\n\nSo, in the tens place from 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, in the tens place, for the entire book:\n\n- For 0-399: each digit 0-9 appears 40 times (since 4 hundreds, each with 10 occurrences). So, 40 fours and 40 eights.\n\n- For 400-488: fours in tens place:10, eights in tens place:9.\n\nSo, total fours in tens place:40+10=50.\n\nTotal eights in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nWhich matches my earlier count. Now, hundreds place:\n\n- For 0-399: hundreds digit is 0,1,2,3. So, 4 doesn't appear, 8 doesn't appear.\n\n- For 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times (from 400-488 inclusive).\n\nSo, fours in hundreds place:89, eights:0.\n\nSo, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89)=188.\n\nEights: units (49) + tens (49)=98.\n\nThus, 188-98=90. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

    "text": " Correct. Now, for the 8's: - Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term. Correct. - Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds place: none. So, 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me check if I counted correctly for the tens place in 480-488. From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, yes, 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's correct. Similarly, in the units place, 488 is included, so that's the 49th 8. So, yes, 49 units and 49 tens, total 98 eights. And 188 fours. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 fours, totaling 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
