I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (ones place):** The digit '4' appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This occurs every 10 numbers, starting from 4 up to 484. The count is calculated as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 instances, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. This is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This occurs every 10 numbers, starting from 8 up to 488. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 instances, and the last range contributes 9 instances (since 488 is the last page). Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is '8' since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 times.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's. \n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Now, 8's: - Units:8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=49. Correct. - Tens:80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, that's the calculation. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, I'm a bit confused because in the hundreds place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers. Let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the hundreds place, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is already counted in the tens place. But wait, when I counted the tens place, I included 440-449 as a separate set. But in reality, the hundreds place counts all numbers from 400-488, which includes the 440-449 range. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488 includes 440-449, so the 440-449 numbers have both hundreds and tens digits as 4. But when counting the number of 4's, each digit is counted separately. So, for 444, it's three 4's, so each digit is counted. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. The tens place counts 440-449 as 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place, and units place counts each 4 in the units place, including 444, 4444, etc., but in this case, 444 is within 488, so it's counted once in units, once in tens, once in hundreds. So, the total count is correct as 188. Similarly, for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, the count of 49 in the tens place is correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
