So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Yep, that's correct. So, total fours are 188, and total eights are 98. Now, how many more fours than eights? 188 - 98 = 90.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 48*10=480, then 488 is 8 more, so 488 is included. Wait, but 488 is the 49th number where the units digit is 8? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, from 0 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8? It's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49.

So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that right? Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 eights.

But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? Each full set (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).

So from 0 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? The formula is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1. Wait, maybe it's easier to think of it as 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and then 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the hundreds place. Let me see: How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights. Now, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 here as well. From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 in each of these, adding 9 more eights. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for fours. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term can be expressed as 10n - 6, where n starts at 1. Wait, when n=1, 10*1 -6=4, which is correct. The last term is 484, so 10n -6=484 => 10n=490 => n=49. So, 49 terms, which matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for units place in eights: 8,18,...,488. The nth term is 10n -2. So, 10n -2=488 => 10n=490 => n=49. So, 49 terms, correct.\n\nWait, but for the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Let me see: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct.\n\nAnd for the hundreds place in fours, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct.\n\nFor eights in the tens place, I had 4 sets of 10 and then 9 more in 480-488, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When counting the hundreds place for fours, I included 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But 488 is included in the page numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if 488 is included in the hundreds place. 488 is 4 in the hundreds, 8 in the tens, and 8 in the units. So, yes, it's included in the hundreds place count.\n\nWait, but does 488 count as a page number? Yes, the book has 488 pages, so page 488 is included.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers or miss any. For example, in the tens place for fours, 440-449: each number has a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 fours, correct. Similarly, 444 would have a 4 in the hundreds, tens, and units, but each digit is counted separately, so that's fine.\n\nSimilarly, in the eights, 488 has an 8 in the tens and units place, so that's two eights, which I've counted correctly in both the tens and units places.\n\nI think I'm confident with this count. So, the final answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

That's five sets of 10, so 5*10=50. So that's correct. For the eights in the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 4*10 +9=49.

Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's a big difference. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit position again for both 4 and 8. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488 -400 +1=89. For the tens place, 4 in tens digit: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, up to 484, which is 484/10=48.4, but since we start counting from 4, the first number is 4, which is the 1st occurrence, then 14 is the 2nd, up to 484, which would be the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units place. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units place: every 10 numbers starting at 8 up to 488, which is 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that last block. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488.

Wait, let me confirm that. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for fours, I considered 440-449 as part of the tens place, which is correct because the tens digit is 4. Similarly, for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is the last page. Let me think if I missed any other occurrences. For fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. Correct. For eights in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights there. So, I think my counts are accurate.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would have 480-488, since the book ends at 488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40.

So, in the tens place, from 480-488, we have 9 eights. So, total in tens place is 40 (from 80-389) plus 9 (from 480-488) = 49. Wait, but let me think again. The 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, so in the tens place, it's 8. So, yes, 9 more eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98. Hmm, but earlier I thought units place was 49, tens place 49, so total 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. Counting fours: units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units place? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? Let's calculate: 484 is the last term. The formula for the nth term is a_n = 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + 10(n-1) = 484. 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, eights: units place. 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 in units place. So, number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9), so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40+9=49. Hundreds place: 800-899, but the book ends at 488, so no eights in hundreds place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90.

So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me check how many numbers that is. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, the next block is 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many eights? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers (480 to 488). So, that's 9 more eights. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Let me calculate how many numbers there are. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. That's (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, each of the first four blocks gives 10 eights, and the last block gives 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total is 98. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place, I had 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, which is 4*10=40 +9=49. So, that's correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. Wait, that seems a bit high, but let me check my calculations again. Fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And in the tens place, 4 in the tens digit occurs in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. That seems right. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, so 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th occurrence because 484=4+10*(n-1), so n= (484-4)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights: units place is 49, as 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four is 10, the last is 9, so 4*10+9=49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 eights.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just go through once more to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last set being 480-488 (9 times), totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, so 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers? Let's see: the first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let me calculate (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the book, so let's count each block. Each full block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, 480-488 is another partial block. From 480 to 488, how many numbers? That's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Each has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., and in the partial block 480-488.  \n   - Full blocks: 4 blocks * 10 = 40.  \n   - Partial block (480-488): 9 occurrences.  \n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, from 8 to 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have tens digit 8? Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 are included. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. Let's see how many such blocks we have. From 1-400, we have 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the tens place has 40 +9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.
