    "text": " So, the number of 8's in the units place is (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place:0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again: when counting the hundreds place for fours, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is included. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. That's correct. Similarly, for the tens place in eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 occurrences each, and the last range contributes 9 occurrences.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     0\n     \\]\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 \\, (\\text{4's}) - 98 \\, (\\text{8's}) = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one. So, 8,18,...,488. That's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me think again. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Yes. For the tens place in fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th occurrence because (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place is 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't count any numbers beyond 488. For example, in the tens place for eights, 480-488 is correct because 488 is the last page. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine.

    "text": " So, how many terms? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term can be expressed as 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Let's solve for n: 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so the last one is 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, so 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 89 (eights) = 99. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recheck the fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:40, hundreds:0. 49+40=89. 188-89=99. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place, in the hundreds, like 440-449, that's 10 fours in the tens place, and 400-488 includes 440-449 as part of it, so that's correctly counted as 50 in the tens place. Wait, no, actually, when I was counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. But in the hundreds place, 400-488 includes 440-449, but that's already accounted for in the tens place. So, that's correct. Similarly, for the units place, 49 fours, that's correct because from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 484 is 48*10 + 4, so 49 numbers. Similarly, for eights, units place: 49, because 488 is included. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 99.

Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many 8's are in the tens place. Each full block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, etc.) has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98 eights in total. Wait, units place had 49, tens place had 49, so 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each step again. For fours: units place: from 4,14,...484. That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each gives 10, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place:8,18,...488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. First four sets give 4*10=40. The last set,480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0.

So, 8,18,...,488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of 8's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

    "text": " So, the number of 8's in the units place is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. Let's count how many 8's are in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last block. Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 = 8, so 8+1=9 numbers. So, the first four blocks each contribute 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the tens digit being 8, we have:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours and eights. Let me go through each digit position again.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, as 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place:8,18,...,488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each block except the last has 10, last has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours minus 98 eights, which is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights, except the last one, which only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers (80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9).

So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets there are. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for fours again. I said 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. But let me list them: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct. For eights in tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 49. Correct. Units place for both is 49 each, so that's correct. Hundreds place for fours is 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 90.

    "text": " So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, the book goes up to 488, so 480-489 would be another set, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many full blocks there are. From 1-400, we have 4 blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for fours, I considered up to 440-449, which is correct. For eights, in the tens place, I considered up to 480-488, which is correct. Let me just make sure I didn't miss any numbers. Another way to think about it is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each position. Alternatively, I could use a formula for each digit position. For units place: The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + (1 if the units digit of n is >=d else 0). Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, for units place, the number of times 4 appears is the number of complete decades (each 10 numbers) plus any extra. From 1 to 488, the number of complete decades is 48 (since 488/10=48.8), so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus if the last number's units digit is >=4, we add one more. The last number is 488, which has units digit 8, which is >=4, so units place 4's: 48 +1=49, which matches what I had before. Similarly, for tens place, the number of times 4 appears is calculated by considering each hundred block. For each hundred block, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10, making it 50. Wait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place for fours was 89, but that's correct because it's the hundreds digit. So, for tens place, 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 400-488) is 50, which matches. Similarly, for eights in the tens place: from 1-400, each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 40 +9=49, which is correct. So, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Total: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences for the first four blocks.  \n   - For 480-488: 9 occurrences.  \n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for eights. Let me check again.

Wait, actually, the hundreds go up to 400-488, but for the tens digit, in each hundred block, the 80-89 range is present. So, from 1-400, there are four sets of 80-89: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each gives 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights. So total eights in tens place: 40+9=49. So, that part was correct.

So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, I subtract the total eights from the total fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me check again: units 49, tens 49, so 49+49=98. Correct. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears as the last digit. Since 488 is the last page, the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many numbers? Let's divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. So, there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then the 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence? Let me think: 8,18,28,...,488. So, starting from 8 (which is 8*1), up to 488 (which is 8*61). Wait, 8*61 is 488, right? So, 61 occurrences? Wait, no, because 8*1=8, 8*2=16, up to 8*61=488. So, that's 61 numbers where the units digit is 8. Wait, but that's different from what I thought earlier. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, units place 8's: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10 each time. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms are there? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. So, 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Wait, but 8 + 10*48 = 8 + 480 = 488, which is correct. So, there are 49 8's in the units place. Hmm, so that's 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, up to 488, so the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last block. So, from 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189:10. 201-300:280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. 401-488:480-488:9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, so 98 eights in total. But wait, let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98 total. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me recount the fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? From 4 to 484 with step 10. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks: 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. That's correct.\n\nNow, for eights:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. As above, 49 numbers.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, the last block has 9 (480-488).

Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, but wait: 488 is included, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except maybe the last block. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, that's 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) +10 (280-289) +10 (380-389) +9 (480-488) = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me add that up: 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the tens place count because I might have made a mistake. From 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. From 180-189: another 10. From 280-289: another 10. From 380-389: another 10. Then from 480-488: 9 eights. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For the eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's printed is 98. The difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets we have. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go back to the fours. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, so the answer would be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers. For the fours in the units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n -6? Wait, no, wait. Let me think differently. The first term is 4, which is 4 + 10*(0) = 4. The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(k) = 484. So, 10k = 480, so k=48. So, the number of terms is k+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. That's correct. For the tens place, fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. For the eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(k) =488. So, 10k=480, so k=48, so number of terms is 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** '4' appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8*61=488? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 8 occurs once every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of complete decades plus any extra. Since 488 is 48 full decades (1-480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). Each decade has one 8 in the units place, so 48 decades give 48 eights. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is the last one, which is another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks are there. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let's verify the counts again. For fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (40-49 is the first, then 140-149, etc., up to 440-449). So 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours is up to 488, which is 89 numbers, but does that include all the fours correctly? Let me think again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. And in the tens place, up to 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference of 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

From 8 to 488, how many numbers are there? The first is 8, which is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one. Let me count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 40 +9 =49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 =98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Yep. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. So, 188 -98 =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both digits. For fours: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. I think that's right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can think of another way to calculate this. Alternatively, I can consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place, then sum them up. Let's try that for units place: For units digit, in each 10 numbers, there's one 4 and one 8. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 fours and 48 eights. But wait, in the units place, the last number is 488, which is 488, so the units digit is 8, which is the 49th occurrence for 8, but for 4, the last occurrence in units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, that means in units place, we have 49 fours and 49 eights. Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. Wait, earlier I thought units place had 49 fours and 49 eights, but when I calculated for fours, I had 49 in units, but for eights, I had 49 in units as well. So, that's consistent. Then, in tens place, for fours, it's 50, and for eights, it's 49. For hundreds place, fours have 89, and eights have 0. So, adding up, fours:49+50+89=188, eights:49+49+0=98. So, same result. So, 188-98=90. So, yeah, that's correct. I think I've double-checked enough. The answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers each, contributing 10 eights each. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the last set. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets * 10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Wait, but earlier I thought the units place had 49 and the tens place had 49, so 98 eights total. But wait, let me double-check the tens place count. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So yes, 49 in tens place.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the units place for 4's. I thought from 4,14,...,484, which is 49 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within that. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence because from 0-480, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. 480/10=48, so 48 times, but including 484, that's 49 times.

So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.

So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 188-98 is 90. Hmm, but let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Let me check again. For fours in the tens place, it's numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, which is 50. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (since 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488, which is 9 numbers). So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 49. That's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Fours are 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. So, 188-98=90.

So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4*10=40 eights in the tens place.

So, yes, 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 89 (eights) = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Hmm, but wait a second. When I was counting the tens place for fours, I included 440-449, which is correct because 440 is within 488. But for eights, the tens place goes up to 380-389, which is correct because 480-489 is beyond 488. So, yes, 40 eights in tens place. Units place for eights: 8,18,...,488. How many numbers is that? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms in this sequence is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1=49. So, that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 99. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the hundreds place for fours? The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours there. That's correct. And in the tens place, for fours, it's 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. So, yes, 50. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. So, 49 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. So, 89 eights. So, 188-89=99. So, there are 99 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **89**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = **99**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " So, the number of 8's in the units place is the same as the number of 4's in the units place, right? Wait, no, because 488 is included, but 488 is beyond 484, which was the last 4 in the units place. So, let's calculate: The last page is 488, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) each have 10, and the last set has 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. For 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So total eights:49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with inclusive counts. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 4 to 484, every 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 88 numbers? Wait, 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours. So total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: Units place: from 8 to 488, every 10. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 +9=49. Correct. So total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of terms = (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488.  \n   Number of terms = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of terms = (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9.  \n   Total = 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
