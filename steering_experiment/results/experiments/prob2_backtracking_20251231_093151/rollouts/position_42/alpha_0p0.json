    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let's see: 488 is the 49th number because (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., contributes 10 eights. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 eights in the tens place for that last block. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, no, 80-89 is the first block, then 180-189 is the second, 280-289 third, 380-389 fourth, and 480-488 is the fifth, but only 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 (40) plus 9, so 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, since the book goes up to 488, 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many blocks? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99. Wait, that can't be right because 188-89=99. But let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me verify the fours again: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units:49, tens:40, hundreds:0. 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99.

So, each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 488 is the last page.

So, the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let's go through each digit position again for both digits.

Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10, and the last set has 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 49+49=98.

So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (each giving 10 eights) plus 9. Wait, no, actually, from 1-400, we have 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. From 1-100: 10 eights in tens place. 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10. So, 4*10=40. Then, 401-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 4's again. I said that from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. For 8's in the tens place: from 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct. Units place for both 4 and 8: 49 each, which seems right because from 1 to 488, the last number with 4 in units is 484, which is the 49th occurrence, and the last with 8 is 488, which is the 49th occurrence as well. So, units place counts are correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. Hundreds place for 8's: none, since 800-899 isn't part of the book. So, total 8's:98, total 4's:188. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). This results in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** The digit '4' appears in numbers 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488), resulting in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences (including 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, 8 occurs every 10 numbers, so from 8, 18, 28,..., 488. The total number is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, there's a 80-89 block, so that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place has 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I thought maybe I made a mistake with the hundreds place for fours. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place of fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Units place: every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, which is 484 / 10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. So, 49 fours in units. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For eights: units place is 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term, so 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I feel like I might have missed something. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can approach it by considering each digit position separately and counting the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each. Let's try that for fours and eights.\n\nFirst, for fours:\n\n- Units place: as before, 49 times.\n- Tens place: 50 times.\n- Hundreds place: 89 times.\nTotal: 188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n- Tens place: 49 times.\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\nTotal: 98 times.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if 488 is included correctly. For units place, 488 ends with an 8, so that's counted in the eights. For fours, the last four in the units place is 484, which is correct. And in the tens place, 488 is in the 480-488 range, which is 9 numbers, so that's correctly counted as 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count how many sets we have. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 0-99:80-89:10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, no, 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which only contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 hundreds (0-399) each contributing 10, and the last hundred (400-488) contributing 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's. For 4's: Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place:8,18,28,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10, the last is 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place:0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 numbers (484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4 \u2192 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 numbers (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four sets contributes 10 numbers, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because when I did the units place for fours, I thought it was 49, and for eights, it was 49 as well. Let me go back and check my calculations again because 188 -98=90, but I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recheck the fours first. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many numbers? Let's see: 484 is the last one. So, the number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So that's correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now for eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? Let's calculate: 488 -8=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, but I feel like the difference should be smaller. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount. Let me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe I can count the number of fours and eights in each position again, but more carefully. For fours: Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's calculate: The number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488/10=48.8). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48. But since 488 is included, which is 488, which has an 8 in the units place, not a 4. Wait, no, the units digit of 488 is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place:49 fours. Tens place: As before, 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Now for eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. The last one is 488, which is included. So, how many? Let's compute: (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, total eights:49+49=98. Therefore, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer should be 90. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so how many 8's in the units place? Let's think: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, it's 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, actually, the number of 8's in the units place is the same as the number of times 8 appears in the ones digit from 1 to 488. So, for each ten, there's one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, we take the integer part, which is 48, but we need to check if the last number (488) is included. Since 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 0, but wait, 8 is at 8, 18, ..., 488. So, how many terms? Let me calculate: The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, when does 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488? Let's solve for n: (n-1)*10 \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, n=49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 is in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units place:49, tens place:49, so total 98 eights. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place, I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. So, units:49, tens:49, total 98. Wait, but let me think again. For units place, we have 49 eights, and for tens place, 49 eights, so total 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, for the tens place in 8's: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nFor units place, 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. So, 49 units, 49 tens, total 98 eights.\n\nFor fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 400 is the first, 488 is the last. 488 - 400 +1 =89. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for fours, 40-49, 140-149, etc., each is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets up to 440-449, which is within 488. So, 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, up to 484. 484 is 48*10 +4, so the number of fours in units place is 49. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. 188 -98=90. Hmm, seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

The difference between 488 and 8 is 480, so 480/10=48, plus 1 gives 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last).

Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (except maybe the last one) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Let me check that again. When counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, which is 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. So, 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me think again about the units place for fours. From 4,14,...,484. How many numbers is that? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, correct. Similarly, for eights in units place, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. So, the calculation seems right. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's list them: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets of 100 there are where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 40, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be up to 488. Let me check each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me add them up: 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 188-98=90. That seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
