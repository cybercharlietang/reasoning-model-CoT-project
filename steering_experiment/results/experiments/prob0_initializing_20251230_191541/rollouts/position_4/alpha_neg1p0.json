    "text": " \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me think. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), then \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the product of these two expansions. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part of the product, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. \n\nSo, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just contribute a factor that gets multiplied by the 6 I found earlier. \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that the term could have different powers of \\(c\\), but maybe the problem is only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nLet me check the problem again: it says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, so \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, unless we're only considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), so that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't typical for such problems. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression. \n\nLet me proceed with that assumption. So, first, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nOkay, so let's work on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nWait, no, that calculation is incorrect. Let me correct that. \\(6! = 720\\), but \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nSo, now, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient of 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, if we're only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we might have to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, that would indeed be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the power of \\(c\\), then technically, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), as I mentioned before. But since the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's more likely that they want the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a sum over the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but that would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems too complicated, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. So, I think the correct approach is to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\), so that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't make sense because the variables are separate. \n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, the terms are combined by adding exponents. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. To recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (considering \\(c^0\\)) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Suppose I consider the entire expansion of both parts. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), and the second part has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When I multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nTherefore, I think the only logical conclusion is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that \\(c\\) is a separate variable, and the coefficient is being considered only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. \n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't a single number, so that can't be the case. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, to summarize, the steps are:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the original expression is a product of two binomials: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) there, and then just realize that the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me check that.\n\nSo, let's first expand \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). The term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well, but since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) part contributes a factor that doesn't change the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of both parts, so when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider whether there's a term in the second expansion that is a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because that would be the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when we multiply it by each term in the second expansion, we get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(something with c)}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need to find all the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component, and we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I should consider the entire product, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\)? But that can't be right, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all the terms from the product. So, perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the terms would involve \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be incorrect because each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts multiplied by \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific term, \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if it's multiplied by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I calculated earlier, that's 6.\n\nNext, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But we're only interested in the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the constant term from the second part (20). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on, is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and I multiply it by the entire second part, which includes terms with various powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient can't depend on \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, so that would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a constant, not a function of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we expand the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if it's multiplied by a term in the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have some power of \\(c\\), making it \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) or similar, which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, that brings us back to 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I consider the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). Then, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present only if it's multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the constant term from the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is not a constant. Therefore, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can stand alone is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, I think the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part, giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me verify this by another approach. Let's consider the product as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply the two sums, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe are interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively. So, \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\), and \\(b^k = b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for the \\(c\\) part, since we want the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) factors, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\).\n\nHence, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider another perspective. Suppose I treat \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables. Then, the product would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges accordingly. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that \\(k = 2\\), so \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so \\(b^2\\), and \\(m\\) must be such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which as we found earlier is when \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), that would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we have to consider the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., the constant term.\n\nTherefore, after carefully thinking through it, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that down. \n\nThe general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I want \\(a^2b^2\\), that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, do I need to consider the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Hmm, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean I can treat the two parts separately? \n\nI think so. Because when you multiply two expressions, the terms combine by adding exponents. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms from the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and we're not considering any specific term in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems like it would make the coefficient a sum of all the coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by each term in the second polynomial, it's like each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which would be 6 * 64 = 384? \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial isn't just multiplied by the sum of coefficients of the other. Let me think again. \n\nActually, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, as I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check this because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the expansion has multiple terms. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't the case. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any specific power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term from the second polynomial, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by each of these terms. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that is, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, the coefficient would actually be the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nWait, but no, that's not quite right. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply it by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't what the problem is asking for. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be the product of the two coefficients. \n\nWait, but that seems to be the same as what I thought earlier. So, if the second polynomial has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), that is, treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable, then the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. The problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, that's ambiguous. But in the context of the problem, it's likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). \n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\), then it would be different. But since it's not specified, I think it's the former. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's likely that it's considering all powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so now I'm confused because earlier I thought the problem was asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, but now I'm thinking it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nI need to clarify what the problem is asking. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, in standard problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, it's often implied that they want the coefficient considering all possible powers of the other variables. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is another variable, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second polynomial, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each coefficient corresponds to the power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit unclear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that it's only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, and the \\(c\\) terms are part of the expansion but not affecting the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the variables combine. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and they are treating \\(c\\) as separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a number. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is to the power of 0. So, that would make sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 120. \n\nI think that's the correct interpretation. Because if they wanted the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), they would have specified, but since they didn't, it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) with \\(c\\) to the power of 0. \n\nSo, to recap: \n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): that's 6. \n\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\): that's 20. \n\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure. If I expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that it's considering the term where \\(c\\) is to the power of 0. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expression as a product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in most cases, when a coefficient is asked without specifying other variables, it's implied that you consider the term where the other variables are at their lowest or neutral power, which in this case would be \\(c^0\\). \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me compute both possibilities. \n\nIf the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nIf it wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think 120 is more likely the intended answer because otherwise, the problem would have specified that it wants the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). So, I'll go with 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this problem, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I don't need to expand the entire expression, just the part that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me focus on \\((a + b)^4\\) first. Since the exponent is 4, I can write out the expansion terms to see where \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the general term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, let me set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That means the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part contributes to the overall coefficient. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so does that mean the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is just a constant multiplier for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? \n\nLet me think. When I multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expansion, but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider how \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affects the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, that might not be right. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to different powers. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will multiply each term from \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nBut since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each of which would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but it's multiplied by terms from the other expansion, which involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\).

Maybe I need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, so when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, any term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term from the second expansion multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) that scales the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I can compute the coefficient from the first part and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. \n\nFirst, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that logic. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and it's being multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is a sum of terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 6 multiplied by 64 gives 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this problem, the expression is a product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to expand both parts separately and then multiply them together. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to expand the entire thing. Let me think.\n\nSo, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that first. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in this expansion because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). \n\nLet me calculate the coefficient for that term. The binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient. Since the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them together, each term in the expansion of the first will multiply each term in the expansion of the second. \n\nBut wait, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't change. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because the second part is also being multiplied, but since it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is. But no, that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which would make it \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), each term in the second expansion is just a constant coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I'm effectively adding terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)} \\times a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since they all have different powers of \\(c\\), they don't interfere with each other in terms of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, since we're looking for a specific term in the product, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nWait, but no, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't just a single number but a sum over all terms in the second expansion. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to realize that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by Q(c), it becomes 6a^2b^2 * Q(c). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * Q(c). But Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in c, not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems odd because coefficients are usually constants, not polynomials.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we're summing over all possible c terms, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nThe sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting c = 1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms with different powers of c, each with their own coefficients. So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times each of those coefficients, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me try expanding both parts separately and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is:\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when c = 1, which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me verify this with a different approach. Let me consider that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for some k. But since we're multiplying, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the second expansion is 6 times each of those coefficients. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, we need to sum all those contributions. \n\nSo, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the second expansion had variables that interacted with a or b, we'd have to be more careful, but since it's only in terms of c, each term in the second expansion is a constant with respect to a and b. Therefore, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But since the second expansion is a polynomial in c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve c. So, maybe I need to consider that when multiplying, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms is if the c terms cancel out. But that's not the case here because the second expansion only has positive and negative powers of c, not zero. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where c is to the power of zero. In that case, I would need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of c is zero. Let's see, from the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the exponent of c is \\(6 - 2k\\). Setting that equal to zero, we get \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about c, so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c. So, in that case, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm confused now because the problem could be interpreted in two ways: either it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, in which case it's 384, or it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about c, so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of c, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second part is a separate coefficient. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, it's 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when c = 1, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of c, like \\(c^0\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of that specific term. But since it's not specified, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely confident. Let me try to think of it another way. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in a and b, and one in c. So, when I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire polynomial, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

So, I think I can handle each part separately and then multiply them together, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the other terms, especially the ones involving \\(c\\). Hmm, that makes sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so their coefficients won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I can just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since I'm only looking for the coefficient, maybe I can just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of the other part. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion would include terms with \\(c\\), and I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

But wait, that might not be correct because each term in the product will be a combination of terms from both expansions, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I can expand both parts separately and then multiply them, but focus only on the terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion will be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. \n\nNow, since I'm multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be of the form \\( \\text{(term from first expansion)} \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)} \\). Specifically, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But is that correct? Let me think again. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when we multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term of the form \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient will be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), when I multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term, the coefficient will indeed be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant with respect to \\(c\\)) in the second part is the middle term when \\(m = 3\\), because that would give \\(c^{6 - 2*3} = c^0\\). Wait, so maybe I'm wrong before. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by a term with \\(c^0\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that's different from 384. So, which one is correct?\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier. The correct approach is to consider that when multiplying the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part can only pair with the term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\) to give a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part) equals 120. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me double-check this. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are even numbers from 6 down to -6. The term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 6} = 20 c^0 = 20\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(20\\), I get \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, which is when \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. But in that case, each term in the expansion is multiplied by 1, so the sum is 64. But in our problem, we're not summing all coefficients, we're just taking the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the initial approach was wrong because I thought the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients, but actually, it's only multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the correct answer is 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient from the second part is just 1? Because when you multiply by 1, it doesn't change the coefficient. \n\nWait, but hold on. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (if any) in the second part. But the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that means we're looking for the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me recall how to find the constant term in such an expression. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient from the second part is 20. \n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of the two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). \n\nSo, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems correct. \n\nI think that's the answer. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by taking the product of the coefficients from each part of the expression. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should give me terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). Specifically, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. So, if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the thing is, we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial has only \\(c\\) terms, which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate part. But when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but that might not be correct either because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you don't change the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is just a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) multiplied by \\(c\\) terms, so when you multiply, you're effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each of those constants and then adding them all together. \n\nSo, if I denote the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and then the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that's a common trick to find the sum of coefficients. Let me try that. \n\nIf I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, which are all in terms of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, another way to see it is that the entire second factor is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're just scaling the coefficient by that constant. Therefore, the coefficient becomes 6 times the value of the second expansion evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this. Let me think about how the multiplication works. Suppose I have two expressions: \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\). Then, the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms that are products of terms from \\(P\\) and terms from \\(Q\\). So, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by each coefficient in \\(Q\\), but since \\(Q\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), each term in \\(Q\\) is just a constant, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times the term from \\(Q\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(Q(1)\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since none of those terms affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not overcomplicating this. Another approach is to recognize that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the corresponding terms. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire product, it would be \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i \\times \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j\\). Simplifying the second sum, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\). \n\nBut since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(i = 2\\) in the first sum, the coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, this coefficient is multiplied by each term in the second sum, so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second sum. The sum of the coefficients in the second sum is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another angle. Suppose I expand both expressions separately and then multiply them. The first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), and the second expansion gives terms with \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When I multiply these together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms; they just tag along as constants. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a sum of terms, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each of these, we get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms. \n\nBut when we collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of all the products of the \\(a^2b^2\\) coefficient from the first expansion and each coefficient from the second expansion. So, that's 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But since we're just looking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 384. \n\nJust to recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Recognize that the second factor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by every term in the first expansion.\n3. Since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n4. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64.\n5. Multiply 6 by 64 to get 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Hmm, so maybe I can first expand each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nLet me start with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well, but wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) don't matter. But wait, that seems too easy. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if the term from the first expression is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second expression is a constant term, because otherwise, you'd have other variables involved. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times that constant.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear, it must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply by any other term from the second expansion, you would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, maybe I need to expand each part separately and then multiply them together? But the question is specifically asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I only need to consider the terms in the expansion that result in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to consider the entire expansion and then look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears?\n\nLet me think. Since the expression is a product of two separate expansions, the terms from each expansion will multiply together. So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that gives \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final answer.\n\nStarting with the first part: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, as I mentioned earlier, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, let me check that calculation again because 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yep, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to multiply the two coefficients I just found. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, to recap:\n\n- In \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6.\n- In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (c^0) has a coefficient of 20.\n- When multiplying the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nThat seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. The key was realizing that since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get that term in the product is to multiply it by the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) from the second expression. So, the coefficients multiply together, and that gives the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can think of it another way. Let me consider expanding both expressions separately and then looking at the product. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nFor the second expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion would have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2, because each term is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. As I calculated earlier, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. \n\nSo, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term, that's the only one that contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms would involve some power of \\(c\\), which would make the term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which isn't what we're looking for. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I feel confident that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (\\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the two coefficients together:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this problem, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that's specific. Let me focus on the first part of the expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), right? So, I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together? \n\nHmm, maybe. But I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Let me think. When you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. So, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply it by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second part will have some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but those don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it will just add a factor that's a power of \\(c\\), but the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, but that seems too large. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., up to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients multiplied by each of these terms. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be, because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would actually depend on all the terms in the second part. \n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that doesn't seem right either because each term in the second part has different coefficients. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so it's only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. That suggests that we might need to consider only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) would be the middle term. \n\nWait, so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, we get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which would be the term we're interested in. So, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the constant term from the second part, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). If I were to consider other terms from the second part, like \\(c^6\\) or \\(c^{-6}\\), those would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so those other terms don't affect it. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the constant term the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term from the second expansion, like \\(c^k\\), then the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second expansion would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\), right? So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as two separate expansions and then consider the coefficients. But I think the approach I took is correct: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, the total coefficient is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). This occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Since the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when we multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking at \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be anything, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of the coefficients. So, let me calculate that. \n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients, we substitute \\(c = 1\\), so we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But wait, no, because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's just 1 times the coefficient from the first part. Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied by the first part, but since it doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But actually, when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because for each term in the first part, you're multiplying by all terms in the second part, so the coefficient accumulates accordingly.\n\nSo, yes, I think my initial approach was correct. The coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to think about it. Maybe I can consider the entire expansion. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. The sum of these coefficients is 64, as calculated before.\n\nSo, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second part, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is present in the first part, and it gets multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there a possibility that the second part could affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in a different way? For example, if the second part had terms with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but it doesn't, so it's just a constant multiplier for the entire first expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\), say \\(a^2b^2\\), in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Finding the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in an expression is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\).

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this case, the expression is the product of two binomial expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I can handle each part separately and then multiply the coefficients for the terms I'm interested in. But the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So, maybe I don't need to worry about the other part involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or is it more complicated than that?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, actually, there is no term in the product that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) because every term will have some power of \\(c\\) as well. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me think again. If I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then multiply it by, say, \\(c^6\\) from the second part, that gives me \\(a^2b^2c^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if there's no term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be zero. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for it, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include all the possible terms from the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is not just a number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the entire expression, and the coefficient would be the sum of the coefficients of all the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) there. Then, since the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by it, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, you have to consider all the cross terms.\n\nWait, no, actually, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, then in the product, this term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not just a number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem correct either because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, let me test this idea. Let's say I have two polynomials: \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(P(a, b)\\), then in the product, this term will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but without considering its powers. So, maybe it's considering the entire product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P(a, b)\\) and then multiply it by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each of those terms will have some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), not just a number. So, maybe the problem is misworded, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the other variables. But that doesn't make much sense because the variables are part of the term. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient\", so maybe it's expecting a numerical value, implying that the coefficient is independent of \\(c\\), which would only be the case if the coefficient from \\(Q(c)\\) is a constant.\n\nWait, let me check what the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial \\(Q(c)\\) is found by evaluating \\(Q(1)\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(Q(1) = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64. Therefore, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) and multiply it by 64, that would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But wait, that doesn't seem correct because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a specific power of \\(c\\), not just a coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\). So, if I compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 64, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that in the product, each term from \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(Q(c)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient when considering all powers of \\(c\\), which would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 64. So, that would make the coefficient \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit forced. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical value, implying that the coefficient is independent of \\(c\\), which would only happen if the coefficient from \\(Q(c)\\) is a constant term. But in \\(Q(c)\\), the constant term is the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check what the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the constant term from \\(Q(c)\\), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that seems more plausible. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, then the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when the \\(c\\) part is the constant term. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nLet me verify this approach. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponent of \\(c\\), it becomes \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, if I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), that occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for the term to be \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**. Using the binomial theorem, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together gives the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the expression is a product of two binomials raised to different powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I should handle each part separately first and then see how they multiply together. But actually, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? So maybe I can just focus on the \\((a + b)^4\\) part and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) there, and then the other part doesn't affect it? Hmm, but wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of both parts. So, actually, I think I might be misunderstanding. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the result would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need the constant term from the second part. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nAlright, let's start with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the constant term here, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent \\(6 - 2m\\) to be zero for the term to be constant. So, let's solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). That gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which is 6) and the constant term from the second part (which is 20). \n\nSo, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 as the constant term. Multiplying them together gives 6*20=120. That seems right. Hmm, I don't think I made a mistake here. Let me just confirm each step again.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has the constant term when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives m=3, so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\). Then, multiplying these together gives 6*20=120. Yep, that looks correct.\n\nI think I got it right. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) with coefficients equal to the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) terms, each with coefficient 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product isn't just 6; instead, it's 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term contributes to a different power of \\(c\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) part is consistent across all those terms.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that each term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears would have a coefficient that's 6 times the coefficient from the second part. But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which typically refers to the coefficient regardless of other variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 (sum of coefficients in the second part) = 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the second part, the coefficient should be scaled by the entire second expansion. Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) terms, which would require the second part to contribute a term with \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nLet me think. If I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me confirm this approach. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, so \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for the second part, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) has a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nBut earlier, I thought about the sum of all coefficients in the second part being 64, which would make the coefficient 6\u00d764=384. But that would be if we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me check with an example. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the entire product becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems to contradict the previous result. Hmm, perhaps the problem is ambiguous. But in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in algebra typically refers to the coefficient regardless of other variables, meaning that \\(c\\) can be any power. But in reality, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible coefficients from the other variables, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6\u00d764=384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term from the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) with coefficients equal to 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not a single number but rather a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is ambiguous. It might be referring to the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, making it 6\u00d764=384. Alternatively, it might be referring to the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at a specific power, say \\(c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for more clues in the problem statement. The problem is written as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part contributes a different power of \\(c\\), but all of them are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6\u00d764=384. However, that seems a bit counterintuitive because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but it's actually a product of two polynomials, so each term in the product is a combination of terms from both. So, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that can't be right because when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the first is scaled by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6\u00d764=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) with coefficients equal to the product of the coefficients from \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6\u00d764=384, or it could mean the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at a specific power, say \\(c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's written without any mention of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's intended to consider the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Therefore, the answer would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the second part is being multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps I should test this with a simpler example. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's not helpful. Let me try another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1) = ac + a + bc + b\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1\\), which is a polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1\\), not just 1. So, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all possible terms, meaning the sum of coefficients, which would be 6\u00d764=384. Alternatively, if the problem is considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in algebra, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible coefficients from the other variables. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6\u00d764=384.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think about the expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a numerical value, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient when considering \\(c\\) as a variable, meaning that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is part of the term. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the second polynomial, the coefficients do scale.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. That seems more plausible because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately, then multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6\u00d764=384. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's intended to consider the coefficient as a polynomial. But in that case, the answer would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But the problem asks for the coefficient, implying a numerical value. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6\u00d764=384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit confused. Let me try to compute the product in a different way. Let's denote \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(P \\times Q\\) is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 6\u00d764=384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check by considering specific values.\n\nLet me set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\). Then, the product becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 16 \u00d7 64 = 1024\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which is 6\u00d764=384. So, if I set \\(a=1\\), \\(b=1\\), and \\(c=1\\), the product is 1024, and the sum of all coefficients is 1024. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384, which is part of that 1024. Therefore, that seems to confirm that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but if I set \\(a=1\\), \\(b=1\\), \\(c=1\\), the value of the product is indeed 16\u00d764=1024, which is the sum of all coefficients in the product. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, as calculated, which is a part of that total. Therefore, I think that 384 is the correct answer.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, which is also correct. So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous. But given that the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. In algebra, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) is understood to include all possible coefficients from the other variables. Therefore, in this case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6\u00d764=384.\n\nTherefore, after this lengthy consideration, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will come from the product of two parts: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply two terms, the exponents of the variables add up, so to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out, resulting in \\(c^0\\). \n\nLet me write this down. First, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We want the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) because when we multiply the two expressions, any term with \\(c\\) raised to a power will affect the exponent, but since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) must cancel out. So, we need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\Rightarrow 2m = 6 \\Rightarrow m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\).\n\nCalculating the coefficient for \\(m = 3\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the two coefficients I found. That is, 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20 because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems correct. \n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are handled correctly, and the exponents are accounted for. So, yeah, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficient, we get:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Each term in this expansion is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from both parts, we get:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this case, the expression is a product of two binomial expansions: one with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient related to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms won't affect that part? Or will they?

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. \n\nWait a second, actually, the entire expression is a product of two terms: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it would become \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something with \\(c\\).

So, does that mean we're considering the entire expression and looking for terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), those terms would have other variables, so maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part? But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. Wait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because for each term in the first expansion, when multiplied by the second expansion, you get terms with different \\(c\\) exponents, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Is that correct?\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by Q, would be \\( (coefficient\\ of\\ a^2b^2\\ in\\ P) \\times (sum\\ of\\ all\\ coefficients\\ in\\ Q) \\). Because each term in Q is a coefficient times some power of c, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) each term in Q, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from P times the sum of coefficients from Q.\n\nSo, in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so when you sum them up, you get the coefficient of that term in the product.\n\nSo, let me compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I found earlier as 6.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial? Well, the sum of the coefficients is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that appears in the product, but it's possible that when you multiply the two expressions, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering only the part related to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, as in the first expansion, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. The expansion would be (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) * (c + 1/c). So, the coefficient of a^2 would be 1 * (c + 1/c). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of a^2 regardless of c, it's 1 times (c + 1/c), but that's not a constant. So, perhaps the question is expecting me to consider the coefficient as a product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of c^0 in the second part is the middle term. Wait, but in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where c^0 would be the constant term, which is when the exponents of c and 1/c cancel out. So, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to find the constant term, we set 6 - 2k = 0, so k = 3. Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of c^0 in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, I should only consider the term where the c terms cancel out, i.e., c^0, so that the resulting term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Otherwise, if I include all c terms, then the coefficient would be a polynomial in c, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, so it's possible that it's considering only the term where the c exponents are zero. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me clarify the problem statement again. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, which is a polynomial in a, b, c, and 1/c, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear multiplied by various powers of c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). But wait, that's only if we're considering the coefficient regardless of c. Alternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times c^0, then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the context of polynomials, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's usually considering all possible variables, so if the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by different powers of c, the coefficient would be a polynomial in c. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times c^0, meaning the constant term in c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c. That would mean that in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of c contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * (sum of coefficients in second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384. But this would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nSecond interpretation: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times c^0, i.e., the constant term in c. In this case, we need to find the term where the exponent of c is zero. As I calculated earlier, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSince the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying anything about c, it's ambiguous. But in most cases, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, it's considering the term where all variables are accounted for, so perhaps they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me expand both parts:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the exponents of c are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6 for k=0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^4\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(4a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(24a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(60a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(60a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(24a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, which comes from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times c^0, the answer is 120. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c term, meaning the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of c, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, the more likely interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which includes c terms. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various c terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in c. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the c terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the c terms are part of another factor. But that doesn't make sense because the entire product is a single expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve the c terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\) or something else, but as it is, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large, and in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6c^6\\), \\(24c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually a polynomial in c: \\(6c^6 + 24c^4 + 60c^2 + 120 + 60c^{-2} + 24c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is this entire expression. However, that can't be right because the problem expects a numerical answer.\n\nTherefore, the only way this makes sense is if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, to confirm, let me think of another approach. If I consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times (1 + 1)^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient is a constant, not a polynomial in c, which is conflicting with the earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is a polynomial in c, as each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\), which is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's this entire expression, but since the problem is expecting a numerical answer, perhaps it's considering only the constant term, which is 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(a^2b^2\\) is formed. Let me write that out. \n\nThe general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), then \\(k = 2\\). That means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think so. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that means we're considering the entire expression and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a term that includes the coefficients from both expansions. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two separate expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), or does it? Wait, no, because \\(c\\) is in the second part, so the entire expression will have terms involving \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, the coefficient for any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, if we're considering the entire product, might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the terms, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the problem statement isn't specifying, so I'm a bit confused. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, collect all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and sum up their coefficients. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem to make sense because the problem is phrased as asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient when considering only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. \n\nWait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part of the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and the rest of the variables are \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that also doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not stated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), since each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that sum to \\(2^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\). But I'm not sure if that's what's being asked here. \n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nIf that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if the problem is asking for the constant term in \\(c\\) or just the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). If it's just the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is presented as a single coefficient. \n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is written as: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nBut the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the intended interpretation is that we are to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120. \n\nI think that makes sense, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that out. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, when does \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\)? That happens when \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider this part as well. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I can treat the two parts separately? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficients from each part multiply together. Let me think: if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can find the coefficient from the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, is that right? Let me make sure.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, since the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) are all different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, no, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, perhaps I can treat the two parts separately.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be a single term, but since the expression includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), that term would actually involve \\(c\\) as well. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that also doesn't seem right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first binomial and a term from the second binomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product.\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to do that, I can consider each part separately and then multiply the coefficients.\n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nSo, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part) gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when multiplied together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). For \\(a^2b^2\\), set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)):**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each part:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this problem, the expression is a product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, I need to consider both expansions. But the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that's interesting. So, I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I can just focus on the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) there, and then the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might not affect it since it's multiplied by that term. \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider all possible ways that when I multiply a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result is \\(a^2b^2\\) times something. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not considering the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient remains the same as in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nLet me check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), because in the binomial expansion, the term \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) has the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another binomial expansion, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean that the coefficient remains 6? Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, say \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for each of these would still be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, if I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each of those terms would be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so it's a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them out, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right either. Let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in Q(c). But that seems a bit off because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. \n\nWait, but actually, when you set c=1, you get the sum of coefficients, which is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might not be asking for the sum over all c terms, but just the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c. \n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include terms from the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical, not expressions. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). \n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me check that again. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where \\(c^0\\), so that would be the middle term. Let me calculate that. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be written using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the constant term occurs when 6 - 2k = 0, which is when k=3. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 6 * 64 = 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? \n\nI think the confusion is about whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or just the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that each term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present would have different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients. \n\nWait, but that's not quite right. The coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial that combine to form that term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), the terms in the second polynomial don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, actually, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{m}\\) or something like that. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum over all possible \\(m\\) of the coefficients from the first polynomial times the coefficients from the second polynomial. \n\nBut that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is the same as in the first polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But then, if I think of the constant term in the second polynomial, it's 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is it? \n\nI think the key here is whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or just the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\). If it's the former, then it's 384. If it's the latter, then it's 120. \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's the former: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me check that again. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 64, because when c=1, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the same as in the first polynomial, because the second polynomial is multiplied by it. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is not a constant. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, if you have \\(P(a, b) * Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me think of it differently. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Then, when I multiply each of these by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that can't be right because coefficients are numerical values, not polynomials. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be different. But since it's not specified, I think it's the former. \n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the polynomial \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem asks for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but no, it's given as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of two polynomials. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems too simple. \n\nWait, let me think about it differently. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges over the exponents in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have any exponent \\(m\\), so the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. \n\nBut that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me check that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I calculated earlier. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut now I'm confused because both interpretations seem possible. Let me look for similar problems or think about how such problems are usually phrased. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, it's considering the term regardless of other variables, so it's the sum of all coefficients where that term appears multiplied by any combination of the other variables. \n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since it's not specified, I think it's the former. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I expand the entire product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think I need to clarify this. Let me try to see what the problem is asking. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nSo, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear with any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). Expanding this gives \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a numerical coefficient. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). \n\nBut in this case, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would have been \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, so maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nThat seems more plausible because if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it must be considering a specific term, which would include a specific power of \\(c\\). But since it's not specified, I'm not sure. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in such a way that \\(c\\) is another variable, and the coefficient is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nI'm really confused now. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think I need to decide which interpretation makes more sense. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without specifying any power of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me check both possibilities. \n\nFirst, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSecond, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSince the problem didn't specify, I think the first interpretation is correct because it's more common to ask for the coefficient of a term regardless of other variables unless specified otherwise. \n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, in that case, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that it's considering only the term where \\(c^0\\), so 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written in such a way that \\(c\\) is another variable, and the coefficient is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would affect the coefficients. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me think of it as two separate variables. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients do combine. For example, if you have \\((a + 1)(b + 1) = ab + a + b + 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, which is the same as in the first polynomial, but the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 1, which is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. \n\nWait, so in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the example I did earlier, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the same as the coefficient in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nBut in the original problem, the answer is expected to be a number inside a box, so I think the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that it's considering only the term where \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a number. \n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Given that the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the terms would be:\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this case is 6. But wait, I think I might be getting ahead of myself because the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would depend on the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I might not need to consider the entire expansion of the second part, but just the terms that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, would still result in a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible ways that when you multiply a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result includes \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Or does it? Wait, actually, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, but actually, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that means we need to find all terms in the expansion where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But actually, wait, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so each term in the product will be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m c^{-n})\\), but I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion is a sum, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're just scaling it by that coefficient, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But actually, that's not correct because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, each term is of the form \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. Wait, no, actually, when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the exponents will be even numbers from -6 to 6, because each term in the expansion is a product of six terms, each of which is either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the exponents will be 6 - 2k, where k is the number of \\(1/c\\) terms, so exponents will be 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6.\n\nBut the point is, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, because when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is not a constant; it's a sum of terms involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply that we're considering the term without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., \\(c^0\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything. But that would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, no, actually, that's correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so 6 - 2k = 0. Solving for k, we get k = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I was correct the first time, and the answer is 384. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where k ranges from 0 to 4 and m ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for various m. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all m of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). But that would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive because when you multiply by a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficients for each specific term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would be scaled by the entire expansion in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But since the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), thus contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not quite accurate because when you multiply, the coefficients don't just add up; each term is a product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can think of it as the coefficient in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by evaluating the second polynomial at \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check this with a different approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term not involving \\(c\\) would be the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Wait, no, that's not correct because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. However, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this ask for the coefficient of a specific term involving all variables, but in this case, the problem is only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think 384 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials: P(a, b) = (a + b)^4 and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6. The product P(a, b) * Q(c) is a polynomial in a, b, and c. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in P(a, b) as 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by Q(c), it becomes 6a^2b^2 * Q(c). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times Q(c). But Q(c) is a polynomial, so when we talk about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're considering all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of c. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the entire polynomial Q(c), but that's not a single number. Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, no, actually, when we talk about the coefficient of a specific term in a product, we're considering the coefficient of that term regardless of other variables. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the sum of all coefficients of terms in the product where the exponents of a and b are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponent of c. Therefore, it's the coefficient from P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients from Q(c), because each term in Q(c) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) is indeed 64, as calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1)^1. The coefficient of a^1b^1 in the product would be the coefficient of a^1b^1 in (a + b)^2 times the sum of coefficients in (c + 1). The coefficient of a^1b^1 in (a + b)^2 is 2, and the sum of coefficients in (c + 1) is 2 (when c=1). So, the coefficient of a^1b^1 in the product is 2 * 2 = 4. Let's verify by expanding:\n\n(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n(c + 1) = c + 1\n\nMultiplying them: (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1) = a^2c + a^2 + 2ab c + 2ab + b^2c + b^2\n\nNow, the coefficient of ab in this product is 2c + 2. But if we're looking for the coefficient of ab regardless of c, we'd have to consider all terms where ab is present, which are 2ab c and 2ab. So, the coefficient of ab is 2c + 2, which is a polynomial in c. But if we're just looking for the coefficient of ab, without considering c, that's not a single number. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the concept. In the example, the coefficient of ab in the product is 2c + 2, which is a polynomial in c. So, the coefficient of ab is not a single number unless we specify the power of c. Therefore, in the original problem, if we're only asked for the coefficient of a^2b^2, without specifying the power of c, it's ambiguous. However, in the problem statement, it's likely that they are considering the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0, i.e., the term where a^2b^2 is multiplied by c^0.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should compute the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0, we need to find the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4 and the coefficient of c^0 in (c + 1/c)^6, then multiply them.\n\nAs before, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4 is 6.\n\nNow, the coefficient of c^0 in (c + 1/c)^6 is found by expanding using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of c is 0, so 6 - 2k = 0 => k = 3.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0 is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify c^0, so I'm not sure. But given the confusion in the earlier example, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the a^2b^2 term, regardless of c, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of (c + 1/c)^6, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the c^0 term.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations.\n\n1. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 regardless of c, then it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\n2. If it's asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0, then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is written as \"the coefficient of a^2b^2\", without mentioning c, it's ambiguous. However, in most problems of this nature, when you have multiple variables, asking for the coefficient of a term without specifying all variables implies that you're considering the term with all other variables raised to the zeroth power. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think again. If I have (a + b)^4 times (c + 1/c)^6, and I want the coefficient of a^2b^2, then in the product, every term will be of the form a^kb^{4 - k}c^m, where k is from 0 to 4, and m is from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term a^2b^2 will appear multiplied by c^m for various m. Therefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is the same as the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in (c + 1/c)^6. As calculated earlier, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nHowever, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0, then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify c^0, I think the answer is 384. But I'm still a bit unsure because the problem might be expecting the answer to be 120, considering only the term where c is also zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6?\" So, it's just a^2b^2, without any mention of c. Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is the same as the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4 multiplied by the entire expansion of (c + 1/c)^6. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times (c + 1/c)^6. But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0, i.e., the term where a^2b^2 is multiplied by c^0.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4, which is 6, and the coefficient of c^0 in (c + 1/c)^6, which is 20, then multiply them to get 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I considered (a + b)^2 * (c + 1), the coefficient of ab was 2c + 2, which is a polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient of ab is a polynomial in c, but in the original problem, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is a polynomial in c. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, which would require knowing the power of c. Therefore, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0, which is 120.\n\nTherefore, after considering both interpretations, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this case, the expression is a product of two binomials raised to different powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I should handle each part separately first and then see how they multiply together. \n\nLet me start with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\), so yes, that's the term I need. \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Again, using the binomial theorem, this will be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI notice that in this expansion, the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2m\\). Since the original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think I need to consider how the product of the two expansions will result in a term that's only \\(a^2b^2\\). That means when I multiply the terms from both expansions, the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, i.e., the exponent of \\(c\\) should be zero. So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSetting the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will give me \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the constant term. The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the term is \\(20 \\times 1 = 20\\).\n\nNow, putting it all together. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I have found that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Since I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, the overall coefficient will be the product of these two coefficients.\n\nSo, multiplying them: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed at \\(k=2\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting the exponent to zero gives \\(m=3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. I think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nThus, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\nThus, the term is 20.\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from both expansions, we get:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that out. \n\nIn \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, that gives \\(a^2b^2\\). The coefficient for this term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think I need to consider how this term \\(a^2b^2\\) interacts with the other part of the product, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the entire expression is a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. \n\nBut the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we're only interested in the terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be anything, right? Or wait, no, actually, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might also be involved, but actually, in the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times (1/c)^m\\), but when you multiply \\(c^k\\) and \\((1/c)^m\\), that's \\(c^{k - m}\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since the question doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients of those terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but actually, no, that doesn't seem right because each term in the expansion would be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean that I'm considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, and then summing their coefficients. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\), the only way to get a constant term (with \\(c^0\\)) is when \\(k = 0\\), but that's not necessarily the case here. Wait, no, the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation. \n\nWait, perhaps another approach is better. Let me consider the entire expansion. When I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, when I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), \\(15c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me check with a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, so 384. But perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a specific term. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's a bit ambiguous, but I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's think about it. \n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. \n\nFrom \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, we get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nSo, to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was under the assumption that the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But if it's specifically asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nI need to clarify the problem statement. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't include any \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut that seems a bit odd because usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, it's considering only the term with that exact combination of variables. So, in this case, if the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384, but if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nWait, perhaps another approach: when you have two independent variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in one part, and \\(c\\) in the other, then the coefficients for terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the problem is written as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which might imply that it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\text{(term from first expansion)} \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Each of these products will be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6*20=120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's the first case, where the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's not specifying any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, perhaps I should compute both possibilities and see which one makes sense. \n\nFirst, let's compute the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nOn the other hand, if we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, as we found earlier. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nNow, I need to determine which interpretation is correct. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nIn algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, it usually refers to the term with exactly those variables and exponents, regardless of other variables. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is mistyped or ambiguous, but given the way it's written, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another variable \\(c\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean that I'm considering all terms where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) can be any power. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. \n\nSo, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\)\", then we would have to find the specific term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is cubed, which would require a different calculation. \n\nBut since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but now I'm second-guessing myself because sometimes when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product, it's considering the term with exactly those variables and exponents, which would imply that other variables are also at specific exponents. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) all together, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. \n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to consider the entire expansion and see how the terms combine. \n\nSo, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. \n\nSo, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, maybe I should look for similar problems or think about how such problems are typically structured. Usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product, it's referring to the term with exactly those exponents, regardless of other variables. So, if the problem had been \\((a + b)^4 (c + d)^6\\), and asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then the answer would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + d)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut in this case, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which introduces negative exponents, but the approach remains the same. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 120, but upon re-evaluating, I think 384 is correct. \n\nWait, let me confirm with a concrete example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). Expanding this, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, if I were to find the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), which is just \\(a\\), then I would look at the terms \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), whose coefficients are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), respectively. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of the coefficients when \\(a\\) is present, which would be \\(c + 1/c\\). But that's not a constant. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Alternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((a + b)(1 + 1) = 2(a + b)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, which is the sum of coefficients in the second expansion times the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first expansion. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in the case of \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first expansion) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion when \\(c = 1\\)). \n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first expansion) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion when \\(c = 1\\)), giving 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the problem might be asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, which is it? \n\nLet me think about how the problem is phrased. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's phrased, it's not specifying any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check once more. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand the product, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). \n\nWait, no, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term from the first expansion where \\(k = 2\\), then each term in the product will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nWhich is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, I get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant, but if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the same as \\(\\dbinom{1}{1} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{1} \\dbinom{1}{m} = 1 \\times 2 = 2\\). \n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120, so I need to reconcile this. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nI think the key is whether the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term on its own, regardless of \\(c\\), or whether it's considering \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nGiven that the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 120. \n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 120, but upon further reflection, I think it's 384. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look for similar problems online to confirm, but since I can't do that right now, I'll have to go with my reasoning. \n\nSo, to summarize: \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\n2. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64 (found by setting \\(c = 1\\)). \n\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nThus, the final answer is 384. \n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the problem might be asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, but I think that's a different interpretation. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's written without the \\(c^0\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is correctly interpreted as asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nI think I've spent enough time thinking through this, and I'm going to conclude that the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but now I'm remembering that in problems like these, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term refers to the term with exactly those exponents for all variables. So, if the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually referring to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because \\(c\\) is another variable. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in other words, the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. \n\nTherefore, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, perhaps I was correct earlier when I thought it was 120. \n\nWait, so now I'm confused again. \n\nLet me clarify: \n\n- If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. \n\n- If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nBut in algebraic expressions, when you specify a term without mentioning other variables, it's often implied that those variables are at their lowest possible exponent, which is zero. \n\nWait, no, that's not necessarily the case. For example, if you have an expression in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and you ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous whether you're considering \\(c\\) at any exponent or specifically \\(c^0\\). \n\nBut in the context of the problem, since \\(c\\) is part of the expression, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be accompanied by any power of \\(c\\), which would make it a different term. \n\nWait, for example, if I have \\(a^2b^2c^1\\), that's a different term than \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's probably referring to the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and \\(c\\) is at some exponent, but without specifying, it's ambiguous. \n\nBut in most problems I've encountered, when they ask for the coefficient of a term that doesn't include another variable, they're referring to that term with the other variables at zero exponent. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me think of it another way. \n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\), and I expand it. Each term in the expansion is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\), but multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but I'm still not 100% sure. Let me try to see which interpretation makes more sense in the context of the problem. \n\nIf I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384, but that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would make it a part of the expansion, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would not exist unless \\(c\\) is at zero power. \n\nWait, no, in reality, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term for each \\(k\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is only present when \\(k = 0\\). \n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nI think I've spent enough time thinking about this, and I'm going to conclude that the correct answer is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. Specifically, we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, maybe I can expand each part separately and then multiply them together, looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So actually, I think the coefficient will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the other part. But wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's just the term from the first part, and any term from the second part will just multiply it. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the terms in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nSo, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second expansion. But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, each term from the second part will create a new term in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not correct because the variables are different. Wait, no, the variables are different, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, and the second part would contribute a factor that's separate. But wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but since the variables are different, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that's not quite right. Actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion would give terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum of the second part. But wait, that can't be right because the sum of the second part is a separate term. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the variables.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. When you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * sum(Q's coefficients). And since Q's coefficients sum to 64, the total is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. The coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^2 is 1 (since it's the middle term). The expansion of (c + 1/c)^1 is c + 1/c, whose coefficients sum to 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. But if I actually expand the product, it's (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c. In this case, the coefficient of a^2b^2 doesn't exist because there are no a^2b^2 terms. Wait, that's confusing. So, in this case, the coefficient would be zero because there's no a^2b^2 term. But according to my earlier logic, it would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect. So, my earlier approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, so what's the issue here? In the example, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is zero because there's no such term. So, my logic that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part must be incorrect. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times c^{m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^{n}}\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). However, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term from the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I took \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be zero because there's no such term. But according to this logic, it would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is wrong. So, where is the mistake?\n\nAh, I see now. The confusion arises because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is not present unless it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term when the exponents cancel out. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part (6) times the constant term from the second part (20), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because in the product, only the constant term from the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. All other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) attached, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nSo, in the earlier example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from the first part) times the constant term in the second part, which is when \\(m = 0.5\\), but since \\(m\\) must be an integer, there is no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is zero, which matches the actual expansion.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the constant term from the second part.\n\nSo, let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. As I mentioned earlier, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check this with the example. If I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be zero because there's no constant term in the second expansion. Let's see: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). When multiplied together, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is indeed zero, which aligns with the idea that we need the constant term from the second expansion to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, since the constant term exists, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, but that's when \\(c = 1\\). But that's not the same as the constant term. The sum of coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives you the sum of all coefficients, but the constant term is only when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in this case, the constant term is 20, and that's what we need to multiply by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, you get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. All other terms from the second expansion would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product because the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But in the example, that approach didn't work because it gave a wrong result. So, perhaps I'm mixing up concepts.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But in the example, that approach gave the wrong answer, so I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, if the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\), it's still a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), but with some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the earlier example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, but when you actually expand it, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, this suggests that my reasoning is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is about what the problem is asking. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in reality, when you expand, you don't get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term unless it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which would imply that it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the example, that approach gave an incorrect result. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 384. But in the example, that approach fails because it suggests a coefficient where there isn't one.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). But in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the example, that approach gave a wrong result because there was no such term. So, perhaps in the example, the coefficient is zero, which would align with the idea that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, but in that case, the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion is 2, so 6 * 2 = 12, which still doesn't match the actual expansion. So, I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you sum all those contributions, you get the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2, but when you expand, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, this suggests that the approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in the example, the exponents of \\(c\\) are such that you can't have a term without \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. But in the original problem, the second expansion includes a constant term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is non-zero.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, if the second expansion has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the example, the sum of coefficients from the second expansion is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, but the actual coefficient is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, my approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the product if the second expansion has a term that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), making it a different term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the constant term from the second part.\n\nIn the example, the second expansion is \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which has no constant term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. In the original problem, the second expansion has a constant term, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense now. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion times the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term in this expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

Let me recall that in the binomial expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). That means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nWait, hold on, maybe I'm oversimplifying. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately from the other terms involving \\(c\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? That doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, which include various powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms with \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the context of the entire expression would mean the sum of all coefficients that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). However, since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are independent variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a single term. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. Or maybe it's considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the same as in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be because the second expansion isn't a constant. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficients in the second part are for different variables. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor is being multiplied by every term in the second factor, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor times the sum of all coefficients in the second factor. \n\nWait, but the second factor is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384? But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression, I must be missing something. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to consider both parts: the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nNow, multiplying these two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. \n\nWait, but the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, it's likely expecting a numerical value, so maybe it's considering only the constant term in the second part. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. \n\nWait, I think the confusion comes from whether the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a variable or not. If it's treating \\(c\\) as a variable, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, it's more reasonable to assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Let me think again. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m c^{-n}\\), but since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, we need to find all terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me check another approach.

So, I think I need to expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply together. But actually, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So maybe I don't need to expand the second part at all. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be part of the product, so maybe it's the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is multiplied by it, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But maybe that's the case.\n\nWait, let me check that. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) (for some k) would be the coefficient from P times the coefficient from Q for that c^k term. But in this problem, I think the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the c terms. Wait, but that's not possible because the entire expression is a product of two variables. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that when you multiply out the entire expression, you get terms involving a, b, c, and 1/c, and the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of c and 1/c. But that might not make sense because the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, i.e., where the c terms cancel out, leaving just a number. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of c. So perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, first, I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the terms where the c's cancel out. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of c is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for m, we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I multiply the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me just check if I did everything correctly. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of c is zero, which is when m = 3, so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) which is 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I should think about it another way. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we have to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 times any coefficient from the second part. But that can't be right because the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific c terms, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps it's just 6 times the entire sum of coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the sum of coefficients in the second part is when c = 1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. But that contradicts my earlier answer of 120. Hmm, so now I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c, not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, i.e., the term where c^0. That would make sense, and that's what I calculated earlier as 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the c terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would not be a single number, it would be a polynomial. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two separate variables, a, b and c, their coefficients are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Because when you multiply, the constant term doesn't affect the a and b terms. So, that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6 a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, I think I need to expand both parts separately and then multiply them together. But I only need the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't have to expand everything. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's focus on \\((a + b)^4\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient for \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right? Because \\(n = 4\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b^2\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well. Wait, but since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first binomial, and the second part is multiplied by it, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient from the second part is just 1, or maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I just need to take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part's constant term, if there is one. Because \\(c + 1/c\\) raised to the 6th power will have terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\), but unless \\(k = 0\\), which would give a constant term, otherwise, it's multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, which we don't want.\n\nSo, let me check if \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nTherefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from both expansions, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me go through it again.\n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\nThen, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, suppose I have a term from the first part as \\(a^2b^2\\) and a term from the second part as \\(c^k\\), then the product would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, only the constant term from the second part would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, yeah, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other possible contributions. Suppose I take a different term from the second expansion, say \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), but then when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), I would get terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\), so they don't contribute to the coefficient we're looking for. So, only the constant term from the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, I think my reasoning is correct, and the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term in the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the constant term, set the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is multiplied by a sum of terms, which would change the coefficient. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the specific term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by each of these terms, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be present in each product, but multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion.\n\nWait, that makes more sense.

Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we have to sum all those contributions.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct.

Because each term in the second expansion is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The expansion is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nNow, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, each term in the second part contributes its coefficient to the product. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first expansion, because the second expansion doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by each term in the second part. So, if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum of the second part.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is a product of two expressions. So, when you expand the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first expansion, and it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\) times the coefficient from the first part, which is 1. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the same as the sum of coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nSo, in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and every term from the second part, so the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second part) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the sum of coefficients in the second part again. The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct.\n\nAnd the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6.\n\nSo, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this problem, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I should focus on the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that out. In the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Hmm, does this mean I need to multiply the term \\(a^2b^2\\) by something from the second part? \n\nWait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient remains 6, and the other part just contributes a factor that's multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the problem is asking for the sum of the coefficients of all such terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number, it's an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out to the zero power, so that the term is just a constant. Alternatively, perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the constant term in \\(c\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. \n\nOkay, let's try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) (which is just 1) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering all coefficients. Now, considering only the constant term, it's 120. Which one is correct? Let me think carefully. \n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear with various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, as I found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this. Let's consider the product: \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean summing over all \\(k\\), but that's not standard. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's in the entire product, considering all variables. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have an infinite number of coefficients depending on \\(c\\). So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. As I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's think about the product: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would have coefficient 6*1 = 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6*6 = 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) would be 6*15 = 90, \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6*20 = 120, and so on. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would be the sum of all these coefficients, which would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. \n\nBut that seems unlikely because usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product, it's considering all variables. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me see the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because when you multiply by an expression that includes \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which seems very large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which would give 120. \n\nI'm a bit confused here. Let me try to think of it differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the product becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all coefficients in the second expansion, which gives me the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, which is it? \n\nLet me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent with the way the problem is phrased. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, it's considering all variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6*(sum of coefficients) = 6*64=384. \n\nI'm a bit torn here. Let me try to see which interpretation makes more sense. If I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). But that's equivalent to evaluating the product at \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\), and looking at the coefficient. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as evaluating the product at \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), and then dividing by the appropriate terms. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, so 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, giving 6*20=120. \n\nWait, maybe I can approach this differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term, which is 20, giving 6*20=120. \n\nI think I need to clarify this. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is the coefficient of \\(a\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not quite right. \n\nWait, actually, in this small example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. But that's not correct because the product is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(ac\\)) and 1 (from \\(a/c\\)), so total coefficient is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem would be the sum of coefficients from all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this. Let's take a simpler case where I can compute manually. Let me consider \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a^2c\\) is 1, and \\(a^2*(1/c)\\) is also 1. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 times (c + 1/c), so 2c and 2*(1/c). The coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 1 times (c + 1/c), so c and 1/c. \n\nIf I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in this product, it would be the coefficients of \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2*(1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 1 + 1 = 2, which is equal to 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. So, that seems to align with the earlier reasoning. \n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120, but that was considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I think the confusion comes from whether the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nGiven that the problem states \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. \n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider the problem again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a^2b^2. Then, this term is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\), and \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients attached to \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me add these up: \n\n6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384. \n\nSo, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is indeed 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but that seems like a lot, but when I add up all the coefficients from each term, it totals 384. So, I think that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120, but that was only considering the constant term. So, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because sometimes when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you might be considering the term with specific exponents for all variables. But in this case, the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the intended answer is 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) with \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in algebraic expressions, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, it's the sum of all coefficients where that term appears, regardless of other variables. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear with various powers of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me consider the multinomial expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve choosing 2 a's and 2 b's from the first part, and any combination of c's and 1/c's from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, it's the product of the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) and the sum of all coefficients from the second part (which is 64). Therefore, 6*64=384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. Hmm. I think I need to settle this once and for all. Let me do a small test. Let me compute \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1*c + 1*(1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 + 1 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2*c + 2*(1/c), so 2 + 2 = 4. The coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 1*c + 1*(1/c), so 1 + 1 = 2. \n\nIf I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product, it would be 2, which is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part (which is 1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part (which is 2). So, 1*2=2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4, which is 2*2=4. \n\nTherefore, by analogy, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1*2. So, in the original problem, it's 6*64=384. \n\nYes, that seems consistent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. Hmm. I think I need to stick with the reasoning that when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, it's the sum of all coefficients where that term appears, regardless of other variables. So, in this case, 384 is the correct answer. \n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I conclude that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so looking at \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this part first. The general term in the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nNow, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient we found, 6, is just for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute some terms as well, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we don't need to worry about the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Because when you multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be 6 times whatever the entire second part is. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because the second part might have multiple terms, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we just need to consider the coefficient from the first part and the entire second part as a constant factor. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, they are treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and they want the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is... well, it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think we need to consider the entire coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to multiply 6 by the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that I only take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then consider that the second part is just a constant multiplier. But that doesn't seem right because the second part is a variable expression, not a constant. So, I think the correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we're effectively treating \\(c\\) as a variable, and we need to collect all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this by another method. Alternatively, maybe I can expand both parts separately and then multiply them, but that seems too time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think my initial approach is correct: the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), that suggests that we need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve summing over all possible exponents of the other variables. But in this case, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's effectively asking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any \\(c\\) term. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, but since the second part is a polynomial, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes to a different power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we have to sum all the contributions from the second polynomial.\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). If I multiply them, P(a, b) * Q(c), then the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire Q(c). But since Q(c) is a polynomial in c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be a polynomial in c. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about c. So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire coefficient, treating c as a variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, but it's not specified. Or maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, which would mean summing over all possible c terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating c as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expression \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, so we have to sum over all possible c terms, giving us 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 times (c + 1/c), which is a polynomial. But if I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it's just \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But in our problem, the answer is supposed to be a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present and \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would require a different approach.\n\nSo, let's try that. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would mean we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of c to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. So, which one is correct? It depends on how the problem is interpreted. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about c, so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c. Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of c. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in my smaller example, if I have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. But if I want the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), it's 1 (from a) times 1 (the constant term in c), which is 1.\n\nWait, so perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But the problem didn't specify the c term, so maybe it's ambiguous. However, in the context of such problems, often when multiple variables are present and only some are specified in the term, it's implied that the other variables are set to a specific power, often 0. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me check this again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTo resolve this, perhaps I should look for similar problems or think about how such problems are typically phrased. Usually, when a term is specified without mentioning other variables, it's implied that those variables are set to their lowest possible power, often 0. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is considering the entire coefficient regardless of other variables or just the specific term where the other variables are at a certain power.\n\nGiven that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that we're to consider the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, if I have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that suggests that the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient where \\(c\\) is also at a specific power, probably 0.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from the first part, it's 6, and from the second part, it's the entire expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the entire expression is considered as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're to find the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify this. Since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384. But I'm not entirely certain. To make sure, let me think about how such problems are usually structured. Often, when a term is specified without mentioning other variables, it's implied that those variables are set to a specific power, often 0. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't include \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that we're to sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\) at all, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the problem doesn't specify any conditions on \\(c\\), we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\).

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this case, the expression is a product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, maybe I can just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of both expansions. So, actually, I think I might be overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because that's the only term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, let me break it down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nOkay, starting with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(k = 2\\) will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in this expansion. Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let's solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(2m = 6\\) \u21d2 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I multiply the two coefficients I found: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. That's correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, as I found. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this problem, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me think about that. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together? Hmm, but I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Let me think: when I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which I don't want. \n\nSo, that means I just need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6. So, let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by this constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think about it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions. Since I'm only interested in terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\), which don't involve \\(c\\), I only need the constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we need the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this problem, I have two separate binomial expressions multiplied together: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the overall expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers. I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but wait, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in another. So, does that mean that the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? I think so. So, maybe I can treat them separately and then multiply the coefficients?\n\nLet me think. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I'll get terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and if I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'll get terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since these two expansions are multiplied together, the overall expansion will have terms that are products of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from the first expansion is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second expansion is a constant (i.e., no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms), right?\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two terms together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, to get a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to pick the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and any term from the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the resulting terms will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) parts. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first expansion, and then multiplied by whatever term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so I think that in the product, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the expansion where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific term, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only part of the term. Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term from the second part would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that might be the case. Let me think. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with a certain coefficient. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has several terms, each with their own coefficients. When you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, each time with their respective coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term from the second part adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to structure this more clearly.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, let's consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nEach term here is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nTherefore, in the overall expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), so the sum of all coefficients in the second part is the sum from \\(m=0\\) to \\(m=6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), since the sum of binomial coefficients for \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\).\n\nBut wait, in this case, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when we set \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the expression includes \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but that would require knowing the specific \\(k\\), which isn't given. Wait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. That might mean that we're supposed to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the product is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, we have a term with \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we're supposed to sum all the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any \\(c\\) term? That would be the case if the problem is treating \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as the only variables and \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. That might make more sense, because otherwise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which might not be what the problem is asking for.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would require that in the second expansion, the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, from the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient of that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and ignoring \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. So, more accurately, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but if the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(m = 3\\), as above.\n\nSo, let me structure this properly.\n\nStep 1: Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nThe term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nStep 2: Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., \\(c^0\\)).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nStep 3: Multiply the coefficients from both parts to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient would be 384 if I summed all coefficients from the second part. But that would be if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) term, which doesn't make much sense. The problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me check again. If I expand the entire product, each term would be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) range from 0 to 4 and 0 to 6, respectively. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that's fixed. But the exponent of \\(c\\) would vary depending on \\(m\\). So, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, that would mean summing over all possible \\(m\\), which would give \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in most cases, when variables are present in the expression, the coefficient is considered in the context of all variables. So, if the problem is in a context where \\(c\\) is being treated as a separate variable, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 384. But if the problem is considering \\(c\\) to be part of the term, then it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again: it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which introduces \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by some \\(c\\) term, so the overall term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms doesn't exist because every term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) parts. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). Let me think of it another way. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if I set \\(c = 1\\), that's just evaluating the expression at \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of all coefficients where \\(c\\) is present. But the problem isn't evaluating at \\(c = 1\\), it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) term, which would be 384. Alternatively, if it wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for similar problems or think about how coefficients are typically handled in such products. When you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression, and any term from the second expression. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would imply that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would make the coefficient 384.\n\nBut that seems a bit counterintuitive because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expression, and when multiplied by the second expression, it's spread across all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expression), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think of it another way. If I have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a certain term in P(a, b) would be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). So, if P(a, b) has a term with coefficient 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and Q(c) has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if Q(c) is a Laurent polynomial (since it has negative exponents as well), then the sum of coefficients would be when we set c = 1, which is 64, as before.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 when considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. I'm getting conflicting interpretations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, it's asking for all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(m\\) of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nIn that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That seems correct if the problem is only concerned with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, perhaps that's the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let's check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\n\\]\n\nIf I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's the sum of coefficients of \\(a\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2 (since \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, in the expansion, the terms with \\(a\\) are \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so the total coefficient is 2.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part (6) times the sum of coefficients from the second part (64), giving 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 when considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. Hmm. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, in the example I just did, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c^0\\), that would be different. In that case, it would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part (1) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is zero because the second part has no constant term. Wait, no, in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), the expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\), which has no constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be zero. But in our original problem, the second part has a constant term when \\(m=3\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nSo, depending on how the problem is phrased, the answer could be either 384 or 120. But given that the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in the context of the problem, since both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are variables, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, as it's the sum over all \\(c\\) terms. So, applying that logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because the problem might be expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. To resolve this, perhaps I should consider that when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's referring to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be spread across multiple terms with different \\(c\\) exponents, and it's unusual to refer to the coefficient of a term without considering all variables.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in that case, the problem should have specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it didn't. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering that the problem is asking for the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the only variables being considered, and \\(c\\) is treated as a constant, but that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) is part of the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again: it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, all variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are present. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms doesn't exist because every term has \\(c\\) raised to some power. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384 if we consider all \\(c\\) terms. But now I'm convinced that the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nLet me confirm this by considering the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 * 15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120, and so on for negative exponents. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. If it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nBut given that the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in most mathematical contexts, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product that includes multiple variables, you need to specify all variables. Since the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely that the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, after this lengthy thought process, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20.\n3. Multiply the coefficients from both parts: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this problem, the expression is a product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe I should handle each part separately and then see how they combine. Since I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term will come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Or does it? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both parts, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific term, not a product.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which isn't possible because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, that seems more complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but in the product, so it's the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) would mean the term without \\(c\\), so that when multiplied, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term remains as \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That makes sense.\n\nSo, let me break it down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the terms where \\(c\\) cancels out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)).\n\nOkay, starting with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we only take the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, which has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by the corresponding coefficients. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term that contributes is when the \\(c\\) part is \\(c^0\\), so it's just 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that other terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, if we have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the corresponding \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so each term in the second expansion would just scale the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by their coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, that would be different.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But that's only if you're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second polynomial, regardless of \\(c\\). But in the problem, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum involving \\(c\\), which isn't a single number.\n\nSo, to clarify, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually a sum over all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion). But wait, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64 = 384.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier thought. So, which is it? Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6*64 = 384, or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6*20 = 120?\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. But in standard problems like this, when multiple variables are present, they usually specify which variables they're considering. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), it's possible that they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion). Alternatively, they might be considering \\(c\\) as another variable and looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which would be 6*20=120.\n\nWait, but let's think about how the product works. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion).\n\nBut the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. So, which is correct? I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. If I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, but in the original problem statement, it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's intended to consider only the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That would make the coefficient 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean 384. But I think, given that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a single numerical coefficient. Therefore, it's more plausible that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous unless it specifies the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and then multiply them together to get 6*20=120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 1 (from the term \\(a/c\\) when \\(c = 1\\)).\n\nWait, no, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\) would be the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a\\). Looking at the expansion, \\(ac\\) is \\(a c^1\\), \\(a/c\\) is \\(a c^{-1}\\), so there is no \\(a c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\) is zero. Hmm, that's different. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is zero because there's no such term in the expansion.\n\nWait, that's confusing. So, in the original problem, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. But in the example, the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\) is zero, which suggests that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let's go back to the original problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's intended to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the sum over all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So, that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion).\n\nThe sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in the example I did earlier, with \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's a polynomial in \\(c\\), but perhaps the problem is only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables or if it's treating \\(c\\) as part of the term. Since the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nBut to make sure, let me consider another approach. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which has coefficient 6. The other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion).\n\nBut the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as calculated earlier. So, 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier conclusion. I'm getting confused because depending on how I interpret the problem, I get two different answers. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, but given that it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\), it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut wait, in the example I did earlier, with \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is not a single number but a polynomial. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6*64 = 384, but written as a polynomial, it's 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that seems complicated, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps they want the constant term, which is 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for the coefficient as a number, which would be 120 if considering \\(c^0\\).\n\nWait, I think I need to look for a different approach. Let me consider the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a^2b^2. Then, this term is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut since the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, i.e., 120.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, with \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, in that case, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's a polynomial. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that seems too involved, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer, so perhaps they are asking for the constant term, which is 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignoring the second part. But that can't be right because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if there's a standard approach to this. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6*20=120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term \\(20\\), you get \\(20a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. Other terms would involve \\(c\\) to some power, but since we're only asked for \\(a^2b^2\\), the only contributing term is when the second factor contributes the constant term.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that down. \n\nThe general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part of the expression is multiplied by that, I think that means the coefficient will be 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the other part. But wait, actually, no, because the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so unless \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can somehow affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which they don't, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is independent of the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is just a term, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's going to be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), the variables are different, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking just for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire other expression, which doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? \n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me try to clarify. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately, then the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWhen I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nTherefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in all these terms, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is \\(120a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). All the other terms have additional factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. \n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6, which is the coefficient from the first part. \n\nAlright, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is 6, and the constant term from the second expansion is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the key steps were: \n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n2. Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. \n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is 120. \n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), so when multiplying the two expansions, only the constant term from the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would introduce powers of \\(c\\), which aren't part of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term we're looking for. \n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way this could be approached. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or generating functions, but I think the approach I took is straightforward and correct. The binomial theorem applies to both parts, and since the variables are separate, I can handle each part independently and then multiply the coefficients. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That's exactly what I did, so that seems consistent. \n\nI also considered whether any other terms in the second expansion could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\), but since they all have factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion matters. \n\nSo, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\).\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, we get \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the constant term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part.\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, I also have this other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this part interacts with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I've already found as 6. So, does that mean that the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the other part? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, no, I think I need to consider that when multiplying two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then I multiply by the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they are separate variables. So, maybe the coefficient remains 6.

But the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part when multiplied by 1, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is separate.

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad, and the question is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question.\n\nWait, maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. So, perhaps the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would just contribute a factor that doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're actually creating terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that sum is just the evaluation of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) at \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible.\n\nWait, let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) is in the other, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that seems like it's not correct because the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Since it's not specified, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems like it's not a single number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer would be 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. So, maybe the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning the sum of all coefficients for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's not a single coefficient; rather, it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), or perhaps the constant term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are just part of the expression, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part is multiplied by the entire expression. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire second polynomial.\n\nWait, no, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) can be any even number, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. That seems more plausible.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are part of the expression, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part is multiplied by the entire expression. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\).

But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but that doesn't make sense because the entire product would have terms involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but no, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, perhaps the intended answer is 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second part, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me try to find some examples. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if I have \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), then the expansion would have terms like \\(a^3c^2\\), \\(3a^2bc\\), \\(3ab^2c^{-1}\\), \\(b^3c^{-2}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term unless \\(c\\) is raised to some power. So, perhaps in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the other part doesn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, implying it's a positive number.\n\nWait, no, in the given problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is multiplied by it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems like it's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), considering all possible terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning the sum of all coefficients for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second part, then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the most likely intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. This coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent to 0, we find \\(k = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying the two coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, maybe I can expand each part separately and then see how they multiply together. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so perhaps I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe I can just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product of both expansions. \n\nWait, no, actually, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\).

Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it would be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when all the terms are multiplied together, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated than necessary. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps I can consider the product as two separate expansions and find the coefficient accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by first finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then, since the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times 64? Wait, no, that seems off.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), as we saw earlier, with coefficient 6. Now, when we multiply this term by each term in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of those terms, resulting in terms of the form \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if we treat \\(c\\) as another variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, no, that approach would be correct if we were considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated, and the problem might just want the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of the other part, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the entire expression, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1, making the coefficient just 6 times the constant term from the other expansion.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and I want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by 6.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that seems more plausible. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then the answer would involve more steps, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that they want the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at its constant term, so the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the other expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire coefficient as a polynomial, but that seems unlikely because the problem is presented in a way that suggests a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when all terms are considered, but only the constant term in \\(c\\). That is, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the coefficient is 120, as we found earlier. That seems more reasonable.\n\nLet me try to see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or generating functions. But I think the method I used is correct: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, then find the constant term in the second part, which is 20, and multiply them together to get 120.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

Using the binomial theorem, that would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the third term in the expansion. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I don't think the terms involving \\(c\\) will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, not a sum. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you won't get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\); it will have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it as well. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second part.\n\nSo, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be present for various \\(k\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can only be multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial, otherwise, you'd have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in the term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents don't affect the variables we're interested in. So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply. But I think that approach is valid here because the variables in each part are independent. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, in the product, any term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) must come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term), which is 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). Now, I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? Because the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, let me find the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\) occurs. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). I know that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, because \\(4! / (2!2!) = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6. \n\nOkay, so that's the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to expand the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, but just consider that it's being multiplied by the term from the first part. Hmm, let me think. \n\nWait, actually, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I might need to consider how the terms from both expansions interact. But, wait a second, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) terms, which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by a term, the coefficient gets multiplied by all the terms from the other expansion. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me correct that. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a specific term, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because we're only considering terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a scalar. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would still result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is considered as part of the expression, but not affecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that seems more plausible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because if that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make the coefficient a scalar, not a polynomial. \n\nOkay, so let me proceed under that assumption. So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, to do this, I can consider the product of the two expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), as we found earlier, with a coefficient of 6. Now, we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), we want the total exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. \n\nSo, let's first find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion has a coefficient of 20, the combined coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When we multiply these two terms together, the product is \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, then it would indeed be 6, but I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, hence the 120. \n\nWait, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand both, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean summing over all the coefficients from the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar. \n\nWait, no, I think I was right the first time. The problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nLet me confirm by considering an example. Suppose I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\). Then, the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). \n\nNow, if I look at the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), when \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), it becomes \\(1^2 \\times 1^2 \\times 1^0 = 1\\). So, the coefficient would be 120, as calculated. \n\nBut wait, if I compute the entire product at \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), I get 1024, which is the sum of all coefficients. So, if I want to check the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I can compute the expression at \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\) but also set up a system to extract the specific coefficient. Alternatively, maybe using generating functions or partial derivatives, but that might be overcomplicating it. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the problem as two separate binomial expansions and find the product term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are as specified. \n\nSo, in summary, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the term:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

That means I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that out. \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this as well because the entire expression is the product of these two. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, I can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. The expression is the product of two expansions. So, when I multiply them, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part will just contribute a constant factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that can't be right because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I need to consider the entire expansion of the second part as a single factor. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. \n\nWait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present in the first expression, and the second expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to approach this differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, so the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the overall coefficient. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, let me confirm this. The coefficient of a term in a product of two polynomials is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial has terms only in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression gives the sum of all coefficients. So, let's calculate that. \n\n\\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). \n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. \n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, as I calculated earlier, is 6. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, when expanded, has 64 as the sum of its coefficients. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, effectively scaling its coefficient by 64. So, yes, the coefficient becomes 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials. The first polynomial has a term 6a^2b^2, and the second polynomial, when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to 64. So, when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second polynomial, the total contribution to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this with an example. Suppose I have (a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + ... and (c + 1/c)^6 = 64 + ... So, when I multiply them, the term 6a^2b^2 will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product will be 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the product, it would be (6a^2b^2 + ... ) * (64 + ... ), so the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that the sum of coefficients in the second part is indeed 64. The expression is (c + 1/c)^6. To find the sum of coefficients, we substitute c = 1, which gives (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64. So, yes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again: is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the entire expansion, but that seems unnecessary. I think the approach is correct. \n\nSo, to summarize: \n\n1. Find the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4, which is 6. \n\n2. Find the sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c)^6 by setting c = 1, which is 64. \n\n3. Multiply these two results to get the coefficient in the product: 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in 64. Multiplying these together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that out. \n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this affects the coefficient. Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). That means I should probably consider that part separately. \n\nWait, actually, no. Because the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), because when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's like multiplying by a series of terms involving \\(c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part? \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Or do I need to consider something else?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that, but the problem is only interested in the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part is a series in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the product is a sum of terms where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (the coefficient from the first part) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied.\n\nWait, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, for example, if you have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), then each term in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) is multiplied by each term in \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\( (a + b)^4 \\) as 6a^2b^2, and then it's multiplied by each term in \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\). Because each term in \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so when you multiply by 6a^2b^2, you get 6 times each coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this approach. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P would be multiplied by the entire Q polynomial. Therefore, if I'm looking for the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, the coefficient would be the coefficient from P times the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you collect all terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients in Q times the coefficient from P.\n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient from P for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in Q is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of Q, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in Q, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of c, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in Q, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in Q, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it would be (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is c + 1/c, and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is c + 1/c as well. But if I were to look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of c, it would be 1 (from the first expansion) times the sum of coefficients in the second, which is (1 + 1) = 2, so 1*2=2. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is c + 1/c, which is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, so maybe the problem is not asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, but just the numerical coefficient when considering all terms. Hmm, but in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. But in the smaller example, that approach gives the wrong result because the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would be different. Let me see.\n\nSo, in that case, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because to get \\(c^0\\), we need 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\), so the exponent would be 3 - 3 = 0. So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. But in the smaller example, that approach didn't work because the coefficient became a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, but let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to ignore the \\(c\\) terms, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me expand both parts separately and see how they interact.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each coefficient in the second expansion is multiplied by 6a^2b^2. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example I did earlier, that approach didn't work because the coefficient became a polynomial. So, perhaps in that case, the approach is correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the \\(c\\) terms, treating them as separate variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6. But that seems unlikely because the product would involve terms with \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times (c + 1/c), so 2c + 2/c. But if the problem were to ask for the coefficient of \\(ab\\), it would be 2 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2*(1 + 1) = 4. But in reality, the coefficient is 2c + 2/c, which is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nWait, but in that case, the problem should specify \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since it doesn't, I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as it is, I have to go with the given expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just proceed with the calculation. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, that approach didn't work because the coefficient became a polynomial, but perhaps in this problem, the answer is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and the correct answer is 120, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems incorrect because the product involves \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify: when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering the entire product, so each term in the product is a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, this approach leads to a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But since the problem didn't specify, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the product involves the second expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up similar problems to see how they handle coefficients when multiple variables are involved. From what I recall, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of polynomials, it's often the case that you're supposed to consider the term with the specified variables and any power of the other variables, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, but that seems incorrect.\n\nWait, no, because the product involves both expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, I think I've spent enough time thinking through this. I'll go with the approach that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so the answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, right? Because when you multiply two expressions, the variables in each part are independent. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. But wait, that doesn't seem quite right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product of both expansions. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The \\(c\\) terms are separate, so when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(c\\) terms will multiply with each term in the \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient remains 6, and the \\(c\\) part just gets multiplied as a whole. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider all possible terms, but I think not, because the question is specifically about \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific term involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't just 6, because it's being multiplied by another expression. Wait, no, that can't be right because the coefficient is just a number, not an expression. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the \\(c\\) expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. \n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, so when multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms, it would create multiple terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion. Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that.\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), then it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, if I multiply 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) by 64, I get 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) part, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when you multiply it by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, it's like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times a polynomial, which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking about the coefficient in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect it. \n\nWait, let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but in my original problem, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and when multiplied by the entire \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) expansion, it becomes 6 times that expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but that would require combining terms with different \\(c\\) powers. But the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but that's not specified in the problem. \n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how they interact. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nSo, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), which gives:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion is a multiple of \\(c\\) raised to some power, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that might be the case, but I wanted to make sure. Let me double-check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. When you multiply these two, you get 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine in a specific way. Let me think about it again. If I have \\( (6a^2b^2) \\times \\left( \\text{something with } c \\right) \\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each coefficient from the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all those coefficients multiplied by 6. But wait, no, because each term is separate. Actually, when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, that makes sense because the second polynomial is being multiplied entirely, so each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient that gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Let me write that down. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I want \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Hmm, does that mean I have to multiply the terms from both expansions together? Let me think. The expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers, so when I expand each, I can think of it as two separate expansions multiplied together. But since the variables in each part are different (a, b in the first, c, 1/c in the second), the terms won't interfere with each other. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Or wait, no, that can't be right because we're looking for a specific term in the product. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, no, actually, the variables in each part are different. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the terms are independent unless they share the same variables. Since one part has a and b, and the other has c and 1/c, they don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in c, not a constant. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, hold on. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the entire expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the other expansion. But since the other expansion is in terms of c, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms? Or perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a single polynomial and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever power of c it's multiplied by. Hmm, the wording is a bit unclear.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in a, b, c, 1/c, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, in other words, we can treat the entire expression as a product, and when we multiply it out, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some combination of c and 1/c terms. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by the 6 we found earlier.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. But in this case, since the two polynomials are in different variables, the variables don't interfere. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating the entire expression as a product, but since the c terms are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a number. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, regardless of the c terms. So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad, and the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of c cancel out, so that the coefficient is a constant. That would make sense. So, the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of c cancel each other out in the second expansion. So, that would mean we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of c is 0, multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that would give us the desired coefficient.\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, let me proceed with that understanding. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient.\n\nSo, how do I find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Let me think. Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of c to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for k, we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it correctly: \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expression as a product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve c, we need to find the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is 20, and then multiply it by 6, giving 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of c is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 120. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(k = 3\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0}\\), which is 20. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions. Since the variables are separate, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each expansion for the respective terms. So, 6 from the first expansion and 20 from the second, giving 120. Yep, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Alternatively, maybe the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a constant, so we can expand the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a constant. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\). Let me check. For example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply 6\\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, in this context, would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, you're considering it in the context of all variables. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a sum over all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant. That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you're looking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving other variables. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify a power of \\(c\\), so I'm confused. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum of terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each multiplied by 6. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you're looking for a numerical value. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify that, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, and since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient would be the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a number, unless specified otherwise. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering all the terms, so it's 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then since the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simplistic because the entire expression is the product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a function of \\(c\\), not a number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but it's not specified. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to proceed step by step. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is this multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply 6\\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get 6\\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, each term will be of the form 6\\(a^2b^2\\) times a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a term involving powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant. That is, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a function of \\(c\\), not a number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and we're to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, you're looking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving other variables. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify that, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, so it's 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unusual. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. \n\nWait, but let me check: If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression when \\(c = 1\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But the problem isn't specifying a particular value for \\(c\\), so I'm not sure if that's the right approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems odd because the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.

So, maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nBut I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking because it's not explicitly stated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is supposed to be a number. I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. \n\nLet me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that still seems odd because the coefficient is supposed to be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which is 6, and since the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is the product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that \\(c\\) is a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unusual.

That means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in the expansion, that corresponds to when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the problem is that this term is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is the product of two expansions. I think I need to consider how these two parts interact. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean the coefficients are independent? \n\nLet me think. When I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, their coefficients won't be affected by the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's in the product of two expressions. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it gets multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that seems like it would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, they're treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, right? So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by all terms in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, but the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's considering the coefficient as a single term, not a polynomial. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not stated. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense. Maybe the problem is intended to have \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and the coefficient is considered as a term in the combined polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so effectively, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't make much sense either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, the coefficient for each term would be 6 times the coefficients from the second expansion. But actually, no, that's not right because each term in the second expansion is a separate term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to consider the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and they're asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), and if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we might be interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning it's a constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThat makes sense. So, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nOkay, so let me work on that. First, let's find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\), which is 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we also need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this problem, the expression is a product of two binomials raised to different powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I can handle each part separately and then see how they multiply together. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to worry about the other terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But I'm not entirely sure yet, so let me think more carefully.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, from this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I need to multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the coefficient of some term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I need to consider whether the second part contributes any constants or whether it's just a separate variable part.\n\nWait, but \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, so when you multiply them, the terms would be products like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. So, that would only happen if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, meaning \\(c^0\\), because then when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6.\n\nSo, let me focus on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term 20 would indeed give \\(20a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 20 times 6, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term (with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. So, yes, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Could there be another term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term without \\(c\\)? Well, no, because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), unless \\(k = 0\\), it would still have a \\(c\\) term. So, only the constant term from the second part would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, my conclusion seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we expand it as:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

I need to find the expansion of this as well, but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I can just consider the entire expansion of the second part and then multiply it by the first part. Wait, but actually, since the two expressions are multiplied together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because any term involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. When I multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and any term from the second part, say \\(c^k \\cdot (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), then the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{k - (6 - k)} = a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{2k - 6}\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, that might not be right. Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the first part's terms. But actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term from the second expansion is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively scaling it by the entire sum of the second expansion's coefficients. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because each term in the second expansion is a monomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a multiple to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, but let me check. Let's say the second expansion is \\(E = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{k} \\cdot (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\). So, each term in \\(E\\) is a power of \\(c\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is from the first expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{2k - 6}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(E\\) multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), just adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes its coefficient. So, let me compute that. \n\nThe second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When \\(c = 1\\), this becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by 64, giving \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because I'm assuming that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 from the first part, and then I multiply it by the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 64. But actually, is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the second polynomial is in a different variable, so the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, each term from the second expansion is a scalar multiple, so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively scaling it by the entire second expansion. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{m}(1/c)^{6 - m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, for each \\(m\\), the second part contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check this again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part is a separate variable, when you multiply by the first part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part's expansion includes all the terms with \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the second part is zero unless we consider the entire expansion. Wait, no, that's not right. The second part is entirely in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. So, yes, 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\), whose sum of coefficients is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the product would be 2*2=4. Let me expand it manually: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Multiply by \\(c + 1/c\\): \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2 c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2c + 2/c, but if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(ab\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 2 times the entire second expansion, which is 2*(1 + 1) = 4. So, yes, that works. So, in this case, the coefficient is 4, which is indeed 2*2. \n\nSo, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me check the second part again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{k} \\cdot (1/c)^{6 - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\). So, each term is \\(c^{2k - 6}\\), but when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a scalar multiple in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion times the coefficient from the first part. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first. So, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, when you multiply the two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression, which are all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient, not the entire term, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, is that correct? Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. But if I'm considering the entire product, then each term is a product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second expansion adds a multiple to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but if I'm considering the entire product, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which is a different power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear with coefficients scaled by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but in the earlier example, when I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) was 2 times (1 + 1) = 4, which matched the manual expansion. So, that seems to confirm that approach. \n\nTherefore, in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes, when variables are involved, you might have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since the variables are separate, I think it's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach is to note that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the specific power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then the second part becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of the coefficients. So, when I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 64 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and confirm that the sum of its coefficients is indeed 64. \n\nThe expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{k} \\cdot (1/c)^{6 - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me check one more time. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6*64=384. \n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts separately.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 is when \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I should focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me recall the binomial coefficients for \\(n = 4\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}\\). Calculating these, I get 1, 4, 6, 4, and 1 respectively. \n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Okay, that part seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient we're looking for. Hmm, but actually, since the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when we multiply them out, the coefficients from each part will multiply together. \n\nLet me think about it more carefully. The entire expression is the product of two binomials: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we expand \\((a + b)^4\\), we get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., and when we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get terms involving different powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the other part as a constant when considering the coefficient. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. \n\nHowever, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we can ignore the \\(c\\) part? Hmm, no, I think not. Because the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would involve the sum of the products of the coefficients from each part. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively distributing it across all the terms, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. Let's say we have two expressions: \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, \\(P \\times Q\\) will have terms like \\(a^4 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^3b \\times c^5\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^4\\), etc., all the way down. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), each of these will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(Q\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the entire expansion of \\(Q\\), which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\). \n\nLet me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(Q\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. \n\nSo, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\(P \\times Q\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. When we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then every term in \\(Q\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(P\\) to produce a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\). \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term that only appears in one of them is the product of that term's coefficient in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) only appears in \\(P\\) and not in \\(Q\\), the coefficient in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64, giving 384. \n\nBut let me double-check this by expanding both parts. \n\nFirst, as we did before, \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nThe coefficients here are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). \n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply this by \\(6a^2b^2\\), we get \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). \n\nIn this product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 6 times 64, which is 384, but here, when I actually expand, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, which one is correct? \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier reasoning. Let me go through it again. \n\nThe problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWhen I multiply the two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're supposed to consider all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) part? Or are we supposed to consider only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero? \n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so there are multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) times different powers of \\(c\\). However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would typically refer to the coefficient of the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the term \\(120a^2b^2\\), because that's the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) stands alone without any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), like \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), then we would have a different coefficient. But as it stands, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it refers to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but in my initial reasoning, I thought that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64, giving 384. But when I actually expanded, I got 120. So, where did I go wrong? \n\nAh, I think I confused the concept. The sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\) is indeed 64, but that's when you set \\(c = 1\\). However, in the expansion of \\(Q\\), the constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) is 20, because when \\(k = 3\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, earlier, I was mistakenly thinking that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), but that's not the case. Instead, it's multiplied by the specific coefficient in \\(Q\\) that corresponds to the term where \\(c^0\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, to clarify, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in \\(Q\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is 20, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\), which is 6, giving 120. \n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this by another method. Let's think about it as a single expansion. \n\nThe entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me consider that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, so when we expand, the terms will involve products of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). \n\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). But actually, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but in the expansion, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all terms where \\(k = 2\\), because then \\(a^2b^{2}\\), and \\(m\\) can be anything, but since \\(c\\) is involved, the term will be \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would typically mean the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, that would correspond to \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q\\), which is 20, giving 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), then we would have to find the term where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(6 - 2m = 2\\), so \\(m = 2\\), and the coefficient would be 6 * 15 = 90. \n\nBut since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, it's the coefficient when \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure by considering the entire expansion. \n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). \n\nSo, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these, we get:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\)\n- \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\)\n\nSo, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in all these terms, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically, without any \\(c\\) terms, is the constant term, which is 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, which was wrong, and now I'm confident it's 120. So, I think 120 is the correct answer. \n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) is 20.\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. I initially confused the sum of coefficients with the constant term, but after expanding, it's clear that the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion would contribute to a term in the product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., up to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term without any \\(c\\)s, that would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) in the second part is zero, i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, actually, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, let me break this down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I calculated earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product.\n\nSo, let's focus on \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). I can expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That seems correct.\n\nAnd in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term from the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're only interested in the term where the second part contributes a \\(c^0\\), because that's the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\)s. So, that's why we needed to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and then multiply it by 6 to get 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then we would have to find the corresponding coefficients, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only considering the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not overcomplicating this. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct approach. Let me recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): that's 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): that's 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that other terms in the second expansion could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the first expansion? For example, if there was a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product, but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), those other terms would involve \\(c\\) and thus wouldn't be part of the coefficient we're looking for. So, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) corresponds to the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. The general term in the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   Setting the exponent equal to zero, we solve for \\(k\\):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients found in the two parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by another expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and then consider how it interacts with the other part. \n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion would be:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nCalculating the coefficients:\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), right? So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would add terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient remains the same?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term (i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) because only that term, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors.\n\nWait, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the term we're interested in. Any other term involving \\(c\\) would give a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\), so we can ignore those.\n\nTherefore, I need to compute two things:\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6.\n2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\):\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2 \\times 3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\n\\]\nTherefore, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 as the constant term. So when I multiply them, it's 6 * 20, which is 120. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through each step again.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the middle term, and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct.\n\nNext, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), using the binomial expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct too.\n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the multiplication. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, only the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) factors. All other terms would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient we're seeking. So, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, resulting in 20. Multiplying these gives the final coefficient as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"
